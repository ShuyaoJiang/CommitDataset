Avoid using inSampleSize for WBMP and ICO images in Glide

The framework doesn't support downsampling WBMP files, and only supports
downsampling ICO files that contain PNGs, not BMPs. I'm hoping that ICO
files containing PNGs that are large enough for the lack of downsampling
to be a serious problem are relatively rare.
