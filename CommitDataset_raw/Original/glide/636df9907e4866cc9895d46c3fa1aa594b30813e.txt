Use Interface instead of abstract ListPreloader
In your examples the ListAdapter and the final ListPreloader are
strongly connected. Using an Interface will remove this strong
connection.

Using an interface that an Adapter can implement has the following
advantages:
1. the dimensions don´t must be passed to the ListPreloader while the Adapter has the first access to the dimensions of the ImageView
2. you don´t have to pass the items to the ListPreloader, while the
Adapter already has the newest set of items (e.g.: CursorAdapter)
3. in most cases the ListAdapter already has an RequestBuilder, so
you don´t have to pass them twice
4. you get rid of an extra class (ListPrelaoder) you have to implement
