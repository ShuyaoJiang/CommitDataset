Avoid masking errors when building a ModelLoader throws an exception.

Currently we accidentally retain some temporary data between calls that
causes a second request for the failed ModelLoader to fail for a
different reason, masking the original error. By clearing out the
temporary data whenever an exception is thrown, we avoid this problem.
