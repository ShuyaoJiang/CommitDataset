Add support for decoding AssetFileDescriptors as videos.

AssetFileDescriptors require an offset and a length, simply unwrapping
them as FileDescriptors or ParcelFileDescriptors won’t work. Most of the
time videos are loaded through providers that don’t store multiple 
videos in a single file or from individual files so this is relatively
rare. However, prior to this change Glide would fail to load any video
placed in resources like raw resources. Glide might also fail to load
videos provided via ContentProviders as AssetFileDescriptors prior to
this change.
