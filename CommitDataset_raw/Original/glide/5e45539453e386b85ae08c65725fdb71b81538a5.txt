MOE automated commit.

-------------
Include the debug aar in release artifacts for Android projects.

We removed the release variant a while ago to speed up the build, which
has the side affect of removing the release aar from artifacts. Since
we expect the debug and release variants to be identical (hence why
we disabled the release variant), it should be safe to just use the
debug aar instead. We will have to specify it explicitly since android’s
rules unsurprisingly only add the release variant by default.

-------------
Bump version to 4.6.0

-------------
Update readme to 4.6.0

Also removes the old v4 dependency from maven deps, I don’t think it’s
necessary.

-------------
Change update_javadocs to use debugJavadocJar instead of release.

We’ve disabled the release variant.

-------------
Bump version to 4.7.0-SNAPSHOT

-------------
Add POM dependencies explicitly.

Fixes #2863.

-------------
Bump version to 4.6.1

-------------
Update readme to 4.6.1

-------------
Fix param mistake (#2873)

-------------
Update SimpleTarget javadoc to match v4 API.

-------------
Add javadoc for RequestOptions.apply/RequestBuilder.apply.

Related to #2858.

-------------
Add support for Uri data uris.

Previously we only supported data uris if they were provided as Strings.

Fixes #556.

-------------
Make GlideBuilder.build package private.

It shouldn’t have been made visible and can’t
safely be used directly outside of the library.

Fixes #2885

-------------
Handle notifications in MultiFetcher after cancellation.

We can’t guarantee that every fetcher implementation will strictly avoid
notifying after they’ve been cancelled.

This also improves the behavior in VolleyStreamFetcher so that it attempts to avoid notifying after cancel, although it still doesn’t make
any strict guarantee.

Fixes #2879

-------------
Re-enable -Werror for java compilation.

Related to #2886.

-------------
Fix a deprecation warning in DataUriTest.

-------------
gradle 4.5.1

-------------
deprecate fragments

-------------
add @deprecated to javadoc and suppress deprecations in code
