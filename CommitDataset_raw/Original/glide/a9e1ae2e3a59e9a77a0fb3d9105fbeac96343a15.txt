Add back assertion on empty resource classes in ResourceCacheGenerator

Currently we're failing to load some images that are present in cache
due to a race condition. I haven't had any luck looking through the code
to see why this happens. I suspect a race of some sort. I'm hoping that
adding the exception back in with additional logging will help me move
forward.

I'm also hoping that this change avoids the worst of the behavior in the
bug by failing only one request, rather than all requests. I may
actually have to revert back to failing all requests if I can detect via
ecatcher that this exception happens but no one reports it.
