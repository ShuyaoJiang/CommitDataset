Avoid passing null configs to Bitmap.createBitmap in LruBitmapPool.

We already handle null configs for our various strategies because some 
types of Bitmaps (GIFs mostly) on some API levels will have special 
native configs that have a null Java equivalent. As a result, 
LruBitmapPool does not throw as long as there is a matching Bitmap in 
the pool even if the config weâ€™re asked for is null. 

This change fixes the inconsistent behavior where we would throw if
the pool happened to not have a matching Bitmap when the given config
is null. Now we universally handle null configs in get() and getDirty().
