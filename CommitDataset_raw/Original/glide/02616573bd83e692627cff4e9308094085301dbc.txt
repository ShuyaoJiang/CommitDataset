Glide libraries. Migrate Docs/Drive's Webp decoders to Glide libraries.

I looked into reading the first few bytes of the file stream to detect if it is a WebP (as you suggested in WebpStreamBitmapDecoder in [] but I was a bit worried due to the format (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebP#Technology). It seems like you'd need to read a lot of bytes... but maybe this is safe...?

Also of note, the tests are emulator tests which were previously running on x86 but are now on ARM. This is because Glide library tests run with --android_cpu=armeabi (the default). As it is the tests take 150-200s compared with 30-40s on x86. Since android_cpu is not a standard TAP flag it would need to be changed in [] to LEGACY_ANDROID_X86 (if my understanding is correct). I can look into changing after this is submitted if you'd like.
