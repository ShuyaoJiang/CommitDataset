catch NullPointerException wherever we call openInputStream

MediaStore, and maybe other content providers, will throw
NullPointerExceptions in their open methods if filenames are null. Since
anyway can update the filename to be null for an entry in media store,
we always need to catch the exception wherever we use the method.
