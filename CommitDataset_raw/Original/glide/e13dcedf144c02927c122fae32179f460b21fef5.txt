Synchronous StreamOpener -> Async StreamLoader

An extensive but relatively minor change to the
internal interfaces to allow for asynchronous 
InputStream opening in the ImageManager. This
allows us to use async http libraries (like 
Volley) without forcing us to always start a 
download and then check the ImageManager cache
only after the download completes.
