Ensure overdraw, not overdraw, of reused bitmaps

Rounding errors should tilt toward a 1 pixel overdraw. These
errors could occur because the application of a scaling matrix
is opaque to caller within Canvas, and underdrawing can result
in garbage pixels in an extra line. Also added verbose logging.
