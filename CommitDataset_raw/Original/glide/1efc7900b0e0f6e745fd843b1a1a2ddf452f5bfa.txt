Post release() in EngineJob#reschedule.

Prevents a race condition where the key is nulled
out on a background thread while simultaneously
being used to remove the job from Engine's list
of active jobs. As a result of this race, the job
may not be removed from the Engine's list, and so
the Engine may later try to add a new callback to
the now recycled job, triggering an assertion.
