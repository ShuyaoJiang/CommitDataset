Add power of two downsampling for GIFs.

Although this may substantially reduce memory usage decoding large
GIFs, two significant limitations remain:

1. The pointers into the color table are not downsampled, so we
still allocate a byte per pixel in the original image.
2. Our downsampling algorithm is naive (rounding) and works
poorly with GIFs with partial frames.
