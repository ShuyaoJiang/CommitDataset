Keep onlyRetrieveFromCache and normal requests running independently.

This prevents cases where using onlyRetrieveFromCache might block a
request on an RPC if a request was already pending without
onlyRetrieveFromCache being set.

However, this change does now mean that it's possible a resource will be
loaded from the disk cache twice simultaneously because
onlyRetrieveFromCache requests are no longer deduped with normal
requests. We expect this case to be rare, and the consequences are an
efficiency issue rather than a correctness problem, so we're still
probably better off with this change.

Future work might include attempting to cancel and notify any normal
requests if an onlyRetrieveFromCache requests completes with the same
key will the normal request is running.

Fixes #2428.
