Encode resources after delivering them to callers.

Encoding after delivery decreases load times,
sometimes dramatically, when a limited number of
requests are active at once. Once all of Glide's
source threads are busy, this change provides only
a limited benefit because new requests still have
to wait for encodes from previous requests to
finish. However, when only a few large images are
requested, particularly with slow encode formats
link PNG, images will appear substantially faster.
