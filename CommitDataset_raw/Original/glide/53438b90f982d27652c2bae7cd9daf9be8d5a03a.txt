Require ResourceListener in the constructor of EngineResource

ResourceListener is supposed to be effectively final in EngineResource.
It was only passed into a separate method to reduce the number of pass
throughs. Since we're now loading resources on multiple threads, it's no
longer trivially safe to call an additional method to set the listener.

Specifically there's a race where the EngineJob exposes the Resource to
any new requests for the same image before the Engine has a chance to
set the ResourceListener on the EngineResource. The locking to fix this
is complicated and would require holding multiple locks simultaneously.
Instead this cl moves the ResourceListener into the EngineResource
constructor and performs the necessary pass throughs to make that
happen. Ideally this is safer and more performant than adjusting the
locking.
