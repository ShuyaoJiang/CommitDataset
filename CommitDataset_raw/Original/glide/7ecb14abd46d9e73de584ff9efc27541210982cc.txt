Glide. Add transformation for rounded corners.

Implementation migrated from Docs' Glide libraries. Let me know if any of this doesn't match up well with Glide's conventions. Also, the behaviour when the size of toTransform doesn't match transformation dimensions was somewhat arbitrarily decided as scaling (which, again, might not match Glide conventions...?)
