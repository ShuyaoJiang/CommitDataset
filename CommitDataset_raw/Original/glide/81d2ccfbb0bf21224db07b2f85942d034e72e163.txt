Handle cache dirs being null + build version check

Apparently either get cache dir method can return
null in some circumstances. If one does, try the
other, if both do, return null. The image manager
will just not use a disk cache if the cache
dir is null. Environment.
isExternalStorageRemovable is api 9+ and we 
support 8, so add a check before using it.
