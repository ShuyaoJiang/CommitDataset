Disable a wide gamut emulator test that fails only on API 27.

It looks like Bitmap#compress always fails on API 27 if the config is
the new RGBA_F16 config. The same test passes on API 26. Iâ€™m not 
currently sure whether this is intended behavior or not in the framework
so assuming the test for now seems reasonable.
