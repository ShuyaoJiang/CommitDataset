Default to ARGB_8888.

RGB_565 has quality issues, both in memory and
after being compressed. RGB_565 is less
performant to draw on most modern devices. RGB_565
also doesn't support alpha and can be error prone
to try to maintain across transformations that
need to preserve or introduce alpha.

Helps with #305
