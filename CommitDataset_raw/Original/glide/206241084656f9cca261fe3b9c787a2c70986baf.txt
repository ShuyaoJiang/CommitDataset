Best effort attempt to avoid memory leaks

The ImageManager will only retain weak references
to the various loaders/transformations/ etc so 
that if they do have a reference to a context
Glide will not cause a memory leak. The only class
this is imperfect for is StreamLoader which is 
likely to be referenced by some callback passed
in to another library, hence the warning note.
