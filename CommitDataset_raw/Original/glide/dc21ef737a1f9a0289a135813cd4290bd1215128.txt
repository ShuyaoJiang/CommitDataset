Avoid throwing in EmptyModelLoader

A ModelLoader for a given data type may depend on another ModelLoader
for that data type. If no such ModelLoader is registered, prior to this
change, Glide would throw an exception and fail the request. This change
allows the ModelLoader with the missing dependency to fail, rather than
throw, allowing Glide to move on to another ModelLoader that may
succeed.
