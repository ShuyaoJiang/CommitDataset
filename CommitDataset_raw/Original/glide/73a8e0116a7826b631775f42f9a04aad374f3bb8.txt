Restart any non-running identical requests instead of ignoring them. (#2261)

Running requests are left to complete to avoid cancelling and restarting
expensive operations (network or I/O). Completed requests are asked to
begin again, but short cut the normal request pipeline and redeliver the previously loaded resource to ensure that Targets and RequestListeners 
are notified as expected. Failed, cancelled, paused etc requests (all 
other states) are simply restarted.
