Cleanup preparing for []
ShadowDrawable.equals() is being removed in cases where possible I migrated to ShadowDrawable.getCreatedFromResourceId(). In other cases this was not possible and the existing equality check was returning a false positive because the comparison, intrinsic height, width and bounds were all uninitialized.

PSA: [] for unit tests that are ~25% faster, higher fidelity + simpler configuration
