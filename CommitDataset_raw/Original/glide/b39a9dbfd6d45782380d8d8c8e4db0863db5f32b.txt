Call clone() before calling extension methods if auto clone is enabled.

Otherwise when our extension methods mutate the RequestOptions we pass 
them, the mutations create a new RequestOptions object thatâ€™s dropped
at the end of the extension method, which causes any options applied in
the extension method to be ignored. Cloning first matches the behavior
of other RequestOptions methods and ensures that the RequestOptions 
object passed into the extension method is mutable.
