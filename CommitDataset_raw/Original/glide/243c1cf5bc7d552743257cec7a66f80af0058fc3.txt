Avoid releasing resources to memory cache after theyâ€™re removed.

Previously when the Target was dereferenced, even if it was cleared 
first, the resource would be put into the memory cache. That could end
up affecting eviction order and prevent Glide from re-using resources
it would have otherwise been able to.
