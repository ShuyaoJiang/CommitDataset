Handle null outConfigs from BitmapFactory on API 26.

We may be able to be smarter about how we perform this fallback. Not
all images are affected and those that are may be limited to some
subtypes of images. This fix may have negative side affects if it causes
us to use the wrong config for the inBitmap. Although the image should
still decode if we use the wrong config because we retry on failures
with a null inBitmap, it can prevent us from re-using Bitmaps and waste
memory and CPU cycles.
