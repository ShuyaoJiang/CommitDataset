Add a DrawableTransformation that runs wrapped BitmapTransformations.

The transformation uses the same logic used by the ResourceBitmapDecoder
to try to convert non-Bitmap Drawables to BitmapDrawables. Exceptions 
are thrown that will cause the load to fail if the conversion can’t happen. The primary benefit of this approach is that transformations
work similarly for the non-Bitmap Drawables that we’re now decoding. 
Unfortunately this isn’t a super efficient process, so hopefully it’s
rare.
