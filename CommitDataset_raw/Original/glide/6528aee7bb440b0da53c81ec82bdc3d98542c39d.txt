Allow request manager retrievals for detached fragments.

isDetached seems like the wrong thing to assert here since isDetached has to do with whether the fragment has UI or not. It could still be alive and attached to an activity. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/app/Fragment.html#isDetached().
