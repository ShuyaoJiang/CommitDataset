Choose whether or not to use HARDWARE bitmaps based on transformations in Glide.

Previously we were checking only against the requested and actual size
of the image as a heuristic to see if we thought a transformation would
be applied. That doesn't work well for certain types of transformations
that don't necessarily change the size of the image but do change its
shape (rounded corners, circle crop etc).

Now we're explicitly checking to see if a transformation will be applied
to the load and I've removed the heuristic. This should catch cases like
CircleCrop and also allow us to use hardware bitmaps when doing scaling
entirely within Downsampler.

In addition, we're now not applying transformations to Bitmaps for scale
only transformations that can be done with DownsampleStrategies alone.
This is a change in behavior, but since the Transformations were no-ops
previously, it should be low risk.
