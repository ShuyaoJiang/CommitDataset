Automated g4 rollback of changelist 209077692.

*** Reason for rollback ***

All requests still end up failing.

*** Original change description ***

Add back assertion on empty resource classes in ResourceCacheGenerator

Currently we're failing to load some images that are present in cache
due to a race condition. I haven't had any luck looking through the code
to see why this happens. I suspect a race of some sort. I'm hoping that
adding the exception back in with additional logging will help me move
forward.

I'm also hoping that this change avoids the worst of the behavior in the
bug by failing only one request, rather than all requests....
