Remove intermediate work buffer.

It adds complication and data copying and doesnâ€™t seem to make much
of a difference in multiple low/high end devices or emulators. If it
seems like I/O might be a blocking issue, we can try just copying the
file into a byte[] in the ByteBufferGifDecoder the same as we do for the
stream decoder and wrapping it in ByteBuffer.

Progress towards #2471.
