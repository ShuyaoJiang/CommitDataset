Avoid obtaining size of recycled Bitmap in logs in BitmapPreFillRunner.

If the BitmapPool is too full or the Bitmap is larger than the 
BitmapPool size, putting a Bitmap into the pool may recycle it. As a 
result it’s unsafe for us to use the Bitmap after the call to put() in 
the BitmapPool, including in logging. I’ve resolved the issue by 
memoizing the Bitmap size prior to the put() call.

Fixes #2574.
