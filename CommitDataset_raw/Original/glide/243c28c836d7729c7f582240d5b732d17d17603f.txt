Avoid short circuiting when removing requests in RequestTracker

Requests can be in both requests and pendingRequests. If we remove the
request from requests and the request is in pendingRequests, the item is
not removed from pendingRequests. If we attempt to clear the Request a
second time it will be found in pendingRequests and will be recycled a
second time, causing a crash.
