Avoid setting the Glide singleton when it's half initialized

If we set the singleton before calling registerComponents, other threads
that call get() while registerComponents is being called may receive a
half initialized Glide object. Half initialized Glide objects may be
missing critical components and using them in other threads may break
lots of things.
