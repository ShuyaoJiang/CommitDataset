Add an explicit null check to Util.getSnapshot.

Explicitly checking for null avoids our previous implicit expectation 
that the iterator of the provided Collection would do the null checking 
for us. This expectation is valid in Glide right now because we only 
pass WeakHashMaps to this method, but it seems like a dangerous 
assumption to make in a utility method.

We canâ€™t require a WeakHashMap directly because all of our usages are
wrapped in Collections.newSetFromMap.
