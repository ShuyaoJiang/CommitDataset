Build improvements (#2426)

* Update Gradle version to latest

* Fix typo in dependency name (Gradle was resolving support-annotations:{26})

* Bump Android Gradle Plugin version to latest stable

* Remove deprecation warning during compile.
(@SuppressWarnings("deprecation") has no effect on imports)

* Force LF as the line separator to make sure checkstyle is runnable on Windows

* Constrain deprecation of GlideModule to a single method (suppresses javac warning)

* Make sure compiledJar's output is unique.
archivePath was the same as jar's archivePath, which triggered a rebuild and re-proguard every time, even on incremental builds.

* Move quality tool initializations near the tasks
Extract version constant for PMD

* Minor gradle improvements: warnings, Java compatiblity

* Extract test JVM memory size to gradle.properties

* Enable auto-completion in IDEA by using tasks.create instead of task shorthand

* Reduce amount of hard-coded paths

* Reduce amount of missing files when running findbugs

* Add missing test for setMemoryCategory return value

* Simplify JavaDoc classpath calculation

* Change JavaDoc {@link}s to {@code} as they're not linkable.
This reduces the noise during build.

* Fix invalid missing references in JavaDoc.
The equals/hashCode method doesn't exist in the classes, so need to reference the super-class.

* Fix checkstyle, javadoc alignment, typo and codify class-name-like concepts.
