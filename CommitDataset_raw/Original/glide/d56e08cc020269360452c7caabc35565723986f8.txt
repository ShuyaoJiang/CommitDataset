Allow modifying RequestBuilders after calling into().

Fixes an issue where setting options on the generated GlideRequest after
having used it to load one image would throw an exception because the
internal RequestOptions object was locked when the first load was 
started. Now we apply autoClone() to make sure that the options object
for the first load isnâ€™t modified by subsequent changes to options, but
also allowing those changes to occur.
