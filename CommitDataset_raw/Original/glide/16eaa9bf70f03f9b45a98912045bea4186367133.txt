Reset DiskLruCachWrapper outside of IOException catch block in clear().

DiskLruCache can close the disk cache but throw anyway in delete(), 
which previously left the disk cache in an unrecoverable state until the
application was restarted. By always nulling out the disk cache variable
we allow for future attempts at opening the disk cache even if closing
it throws. 

This particular case was caused by a bug in DiskLruCache where it would
throw on an empty directory if the cache were deleted outside the app
while the app was still running, but broadly speaking it seems like a 
bad idea to allow our disk cache to get into a state where the app must
be killed for it to function again, even if we might partially ignore
a clear disk cache command (which wouldnâ€™t be retried or recovered in 
the previous implementation anyway).

Fixes #2465.
