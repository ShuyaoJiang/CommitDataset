Avoid IndexOutOfBoundsException in ResourceCacheGenerator.

This is a temporary fix, we're handling this same error (no available
ModelLoader) in two different ways, depending on whether ModelLoaders
return false from handles() or null from buildLoadData. I'll file a
separate bug to fix this independently, since it may be a bit more
involved.
