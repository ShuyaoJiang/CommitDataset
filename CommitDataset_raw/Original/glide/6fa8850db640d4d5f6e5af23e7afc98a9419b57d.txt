RequestQueue has been changed

If we click back from the activity the API object still the same because it's a static object
and if we navigate again to the activity, we are creating a new RequestQueue, but in Api.get(requestQueue) the API object is not null so here we are dealing with two request queues and the callback functions is never called.
