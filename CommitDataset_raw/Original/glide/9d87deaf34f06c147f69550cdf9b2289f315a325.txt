Stop GifDrawable in onFrameReady if all callbacks are Drawables.

When we use TransitionDrawable, the GifDrawable’s callback is always
non-null and always the TransitionDrawable, even if the
TransitionDrawable was removed from the view hierarchy. Checking up
the callback chain allows us to ensure that there’s a non-Drawable 
callback eventually.
