Handle notifications in MultiFetcher after cancellation.

We can’t guarantee that every fetcher implementation will strictly avoid
notifying after they’ve been cancelled. 

This also improves the behavior in VolleyStreamFetcher so that it attempts to avoid notifying after cancel, although it still doesn’t make
any strict guarantee.

Fixes #2879
