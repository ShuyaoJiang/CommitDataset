Glide nullable annotations. Part 1; the major bits and pieces.

I may have misinterpreted some of these. Particularly unsure about ModelLoader#buildLoadData(). Is the model allowed to be null? I've noticed many implementations dereference it without checking but I've also noticed one instance of null (possibly) being passed in (StringLoader.java). I've left it without the nullable annotation as StringLoader seems to be the outlier here.
