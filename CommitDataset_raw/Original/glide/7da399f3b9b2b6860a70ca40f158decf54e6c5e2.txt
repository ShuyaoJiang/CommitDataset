Avoid recycle Drawables/Bitmaps passed in or loaded from Resources.

Both Android’s Resources class and AppCompat class will cache content
they decode. If they happen to decode a Bitmap or a BitmapDrawable,
it’s not safe for Glide to recycle or re-use the Bitmap or 
BitmapDrawable because the cached entry may eventually be returned 
again. To avoid this case, we now simply avoid recycling Bitmaps and
Drawables we don’t decode directly.
