Disable cross fade in TransitionDrawable by default

The cross fade method in TransitionDrawable controls whether or not the
Drawable transitioned from is faded out.

If cross fading is enabled, the old Drawable's alpha is animated from
100 to 0 while the new Drawable's alpha is animated from 0 to 100. Using
this behavior can cause performance problems on older phones and
produces a whiteout affect in the middle of the transition where both
Drawables are at 50% opacity but the background color behind the
TransitionDrawable can be seen clearly.

With cross fading disabled, the old Drawable's alpha is not animated and
the new Drawable is simply faded in on top of the old Drawable.

This does change the default behavior in Glide. If users prefer the old
behavior, they can use DrawableCrossFadeFactory.Builder to re-enable
TransitionDrawable's cross fade.
