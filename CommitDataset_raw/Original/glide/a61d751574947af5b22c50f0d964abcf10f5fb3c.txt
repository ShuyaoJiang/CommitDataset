Avoid setting the Accept-Encoding header to identify by default.

The Accept-Encoding header was added to ensure that we receive content
length headers in responses. The Performance section of 
HttpUrlConnection’s documentation https://goo.gl/o2jeUM) indicates that
unless Accept-Encoding is set to ‘identity’, the content length of the
response will be cleared. In practice this appears to be incorrect for
all API levels that Glide v4 supports (14+) and content length is
always populated. 

Passing in ‘identity’ as the encoding header is problematic because
it disables the default compression in HttpUrlConnection and some 
servers disregard the header and provide compressed data anyway. There’s
not much point in adding extra complexity to Glide to handle compressed
data if the ‘identity’ header isn’t actually required to get valid
content lengths for images.

Fixes #2132.
