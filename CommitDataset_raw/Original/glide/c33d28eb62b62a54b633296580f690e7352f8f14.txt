Eliminate some duplicate code in EngineJob and simplify removing Callbacks.

Ignored callbacks used to be necessary because we needed to avoid
ConcurrentModificationExceptions while iterating over the list that we
were modifying. Now we're iterating over a copy of the callbacks list,
so we don't need to worry about concurrent modifications. As a result we
can just directly remove the callback from the callbacks list and not
keep any separate set of ignored callbacks.
