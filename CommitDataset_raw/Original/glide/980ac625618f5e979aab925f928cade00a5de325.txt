Improve WRAP_CONTENT/padding logic in ViewTarget.

1. Treats WRAP_CONTENT as SIZE_ORIGINAL
2. Uniformly accounts for padding in ViewTarget.
The prior implementation failed to handle padding
correctly when the Viewâ€™s size was not immediately
available (usually WRAP_CONTENT or MATCH_PARENT).

Progress towards #939.
