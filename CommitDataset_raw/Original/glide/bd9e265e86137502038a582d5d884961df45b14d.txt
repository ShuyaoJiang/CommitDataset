Add VectorDrawable support for placeholder (#1946)

This allows you to use VectorDrawable with the support lib
( vectorDrawables.useSupportLibrary = true)
for placeholder, error and fallback drawables.

Of course, if the id points to a regular (not vector drawable) resource, the
resource still inflate as usual.
