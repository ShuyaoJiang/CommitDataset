Create an instrumentation subpackage for Glide emulator tests.

Android's testing frameworks seem happier if there's a binary
to test against. Without the binary running tests on Firebase
is impossible at the moment. There's also some strange
behavior with regards to resource ids of Drawables that are
included in the test apk but not the binary apk.

Creating a dummy app resolves most of these issues and
seems straight forward to maintain moving forward.
