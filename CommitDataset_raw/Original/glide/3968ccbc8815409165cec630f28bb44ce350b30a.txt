Disable all release variants in Glide.

There’s no difference whatsoever in any of our configurations between
the two variants. As a result we’ve been building all of our code
and running all of our tests twice, which is slow and doesn’t add any
value. It’s a little weird to see that the jars we upload to maven are
based on ‘debug’ variants, but that should be fine since we do nothing
different for release vs debug builds.

We can’t default to the release build only because AndroidStudio and
other dev tools assume that the debug variant will be present.
