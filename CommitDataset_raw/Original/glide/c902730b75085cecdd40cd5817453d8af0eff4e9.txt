Catch NPEs and RuntimeExceptions thrown in getActiveNetworkInfo.

The framework seems to throw these on various devices and versions of
Android, though mostly on Samsung between APIs 22 and 24. 

The deleted test was passing because of an exception in isConnected, not
in registerReceiver so it was incorrect. There doesnâ€™t seem to be a way
to force Robolectric to throw when registering receivers.
