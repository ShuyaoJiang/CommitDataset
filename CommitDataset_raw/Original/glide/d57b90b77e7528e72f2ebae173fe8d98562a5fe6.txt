Add a system for emulator based regression testing.

The tests can both generate canonical output specific to one
or more Android SDKs and compare the current output to previously
generated images to detect regressions.

Ideally we can add top level tests for most Glide functionality
using these tests to detect regression across the library without
a ton of overhead either when new tests are added or when
functionality is intentionally.
