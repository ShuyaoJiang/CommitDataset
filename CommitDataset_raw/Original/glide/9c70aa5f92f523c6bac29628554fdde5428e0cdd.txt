Clear the error request in ErrorRequestCoordinator if it’s running.

Previously we’d never clear the error request which could lead to a
StateVerifier exception or an object pooling error because 
primary.isLoadFailed() would always return false because the state would
be reset from failed to cleared in the call to primarly.clear() on the 
line immediately above the check.

Fixes #2767.
