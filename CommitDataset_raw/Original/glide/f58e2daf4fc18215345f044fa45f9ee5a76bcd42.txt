Rollforward [] with a bit to track scale vs non-scale transformations.

This allows us to apply scale transformations if we decode from a video but
still use the hardware config if we decode from an image. Unfortunately it
won't work for custom transformations that only scale. We'd probably have to
extend the Transformation API to let transformations indicate that they only
scale and I'm not sure that that's common enough to be useful.
