*** Original change description ***

Default hardware bitmaps to off via the Downsampler option.

Right now we default hardware Bitmaps to off via a deprecated DecodeFormat enum value. We want to remove the deprecated DecodeFormat. Moving the default off state for hardware Bitmaps into the non-deprecated option will let us complete that migration without also defaulting hardware bitmaps to on.

Hopefully in...
