Improve byte[] loading and consistency.

Two significant issues are resolved here:
1. Using Glide.with().load(byte[]) and Glide.with().asDrawable().load(byte[]) used different sets of default options.
2. All byte[] loads default to using the same disk cache key unless override with a signature (which happens inconsistently depending on which variation of load() is called in #1).
