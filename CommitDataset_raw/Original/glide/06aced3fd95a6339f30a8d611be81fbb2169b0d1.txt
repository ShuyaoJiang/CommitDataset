Always use TransitionDrawable for cross fades.

RecyclerView breaks badly when you run ViewAnimation on its views 
outside of an ItemAnimator. As a result, Glideâ€™s cross fades are broken
when used for loads into ImageViews in RecyclerView. Instead of using
ViewAnimations when no placeholder is set in the cross fade, we can 
instead default to cross fading from a transparent ColorDrawable. Using
the ColorDrawable avoids the issues with ViewAnimations in RecyclerView
and provides a similar looking effect.
