Avoid throwing when decoding Files with DiskCacheStrategy.AUTOMATIC.

AUTOMATIC allows decoding items from the resource cache in case the item
being loaded is local. If the item is remote and the user is requesting
a File however, the resource cache generator will throw an exception
because it’s unable to find any path that will obtain a File from any
Model. I’ve fixed this here by special casing Files and ignoring missing
paths for them in ResourceCacheGenerator so that loads for File types
won’t fail with automatic if they would have otherwise succeed with
DiskCacheStrategy.DATA. I’ve also updated a few of the error messages
to try to make it clearer why a load has failed if it fails for a 
similar reason.

Fixes #2824.
