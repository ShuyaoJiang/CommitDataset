Support HARDWARE Bitmaps in Android O+ in Glide.

From adb shell dumpsys meminfo com.google.android.apps.photos on a 2016
Pixel on OPM1.170816.001:

These numbers aren't super solid. Some extra invalidations can dump more
Bitmaps into our Bitmap pool which will make it look like the steady
state memory usage is increasing even though the maximum amount remains
the same. That said, I see between a 33% and 50% improvement in native
heap usage after this change. This was tested by flinging back and forth
in the All grid in Photos.

This change is limited to HARDWARE Bitmap support. We ought to also be
able to reduce the bitmap pool size in O+ now that we only care about
re-using Bitmaps for very small images or while generating thumbnails
for the first time.
