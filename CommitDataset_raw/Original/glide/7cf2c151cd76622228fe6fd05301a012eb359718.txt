Cleanup Glide’s fat jar.

1. Eliminates the separate debug/release variant builds since both are identical at the moment.
2. Depends on compilation tasks rather than build tasks to reduce build time
3. Removes annotation/compiler from the fat jar javadocs (it wasn’t included in the javadocs anyway)
4. Remove deprecated usage of javaCompile.
