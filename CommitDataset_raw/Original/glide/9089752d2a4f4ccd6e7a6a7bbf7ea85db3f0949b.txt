Remove pause() and isPaused() from Request API

Various other changes allowing Requests to restart have removed the
assertion that cleared requests are never restarted. There doesn't seem
to be any need currently to distinguish between a request that's cleared
by a call to Glide.with().clear() and a request that's cleared by Glide.
We can simplify the API and reduce confusion by just calling clear()
directly and removing pause() entirely.
