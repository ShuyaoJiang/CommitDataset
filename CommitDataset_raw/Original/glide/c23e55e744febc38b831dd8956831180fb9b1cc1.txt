Fix a memory leak

If a view hadn't been measured by the time the 
path was loaded, the dimens runnable would repost
itself until it was. For views that are invisible,
this would occur forever, or until the view became
visible. If the view never became visible, the
runnable would be reposted infinitely and retain
its references infinitely -> leaking photo manager
