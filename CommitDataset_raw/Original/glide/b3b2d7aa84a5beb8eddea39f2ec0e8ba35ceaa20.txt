Add a CustomTarget class

Extending Target directly requires implementing some not totally trivial
boilerplate logic in set/getRequest and getSize. This class does not
implement onLoadCleared, and should provide an implementation safer than
BaseTarget and SimpleTarget, but more convenient than just the Target
interface. See #3304 for an example request for this class.
