Catch/ignore SecurityException opening MediaStore thumbnails.

A Uri permission grant for a MediaStore Uri will only grant access to the main Uri, not the thumbnail Uri. Applications that have only Uri permissions and not the storage runtime permissions will receive a SecurityException when they try to open the corresponding thumbnail. 

Prior to this change, the thumbnail exception would cause the entire
request to fail. After this change only the thumbnail portion of the request will fail so the image may still be loaded via the original MediaStore Uri. 

Fixes #3504.
