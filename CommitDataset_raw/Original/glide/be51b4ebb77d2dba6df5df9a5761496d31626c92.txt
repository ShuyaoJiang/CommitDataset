Use the requested config, not the previous config in SizeConfigStrategy.

Previously we'd use the config of the Bitmap that we happened to pull
from the pool instead of the config we'd requested. This isn't
frequently an issue because we only allow cross config re-use in a few
cases and we also need a size match. However, it's clearly incorrect to
ignore the requested config and can cause crashes.
