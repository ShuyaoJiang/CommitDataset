This is in preparation for incoming upgrade of //third_party/java/robolectric

This migrates down-casts of Context.getPackageManager() to RobolectricPackageManager which make assumptions about the implementation details. After the upgrade Context.getPackageManager() will return Android's own ApplicationPackageManager (although that may change over different SDK versions).

This phase of the migration moves users to the safe RuntimeEnvironment.getRobolectricPackageManager()
