Don't publish :glide as anything to Maven repos
Build :glide as 'glide-full' to have a flat jar to be published on GitHub/releases
Publish :library as 'group:glide' as AAR and JAR to Maven repos
Make :third_party:gif_decoder and :third_party:disklrucache first-class published gradle dependencies
Remove duplicated repositories, JAR_PREFIX, JAR_POSTFIX declarations (pull constants up to :integration and :third_party level)
Fix JavaDoc generation (Error reading file: ${androidSdkDirectory}\docs\reference\package-list)
Move JAR generation to upload.gradle (from integration/build.gradle) so it's used by :library as well
Add javadoc and sources JAR generation to upload.gradle for non-android projects as well
