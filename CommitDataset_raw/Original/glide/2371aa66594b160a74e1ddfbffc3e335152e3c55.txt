Avoid unsafely recycling Bitmaps in DrawableTransformation.

There were two issues here:
1. The BitmapPool used by the Drawable converter was recycling Bitmaps
when it was used specifically to avoid recycling Bitmaps when the converter didn’t allocate the returned values
2. If the Drawable wasn’t transformed, because the BitmapTransformation that the DrawableTransformation wrapped didn’t need to mutate the 
converted Drawable, the intermediate Bitmap would be placed into the
BitmapPool twice.

Both of these issues should be fixed with some additional tests to 
hopefully prevent this from happening again.
