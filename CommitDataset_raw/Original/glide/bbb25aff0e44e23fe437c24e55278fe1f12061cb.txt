Pass a non-application Context into Glideâ€™s Requests.

We can use the default themes from Activities and/or Context wrappers
to obtain placeholder Drawables, which can be more efficient than
forcing callers to call getDrawable when building their request and more
powerful/neater than having callers pass in a Theme.

This change does NOT pass through the Context or Themes to the decoder
that loads non-Bitmap drawables on a background thread to avoid memory
leaks.

Fixes #1267.
