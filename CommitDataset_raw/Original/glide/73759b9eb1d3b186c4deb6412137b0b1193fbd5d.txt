Default active resource retention false.

Although Glide avoids recycling or mutating Bitmaps recovered from
active resources via weak references, we can't prevent callers from
doing so. If callers do mutate or recycle the Bitmaps, Glide may throw
exceptions, show graphical errors, or experience other undefined
behavior. Since we can't guarantee that Glide's behavior is safe, it
doesn't make sense to default this option on.

That said, recycling or mutating Bitmaps returned by Glide isn't
strictly safe either and is generally both bad and inefficient. If
applications use the safe and efficient RequestManager.clear method
instead, setting this option to true will work as expected. As a result,
we'll retain the option, but force users to opt in if they want the
benefit.
