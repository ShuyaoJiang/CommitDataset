Use correct any... matchers for primitive numeric parameters

More Information: []
Mockito relies on Java type checking to ensure that the matchers are used in a
type safe manner. While that works for the most part it does not work well
for primitive numeric parameters as Java will do widening conversions if the
types are not exact, which means that anyInt() can be used for long parameters.
That has no effect in the current version of Mockito as it does not do type
checking for the any... matchers. However, future versions do type check and
expect exact match on type for primitive matchers.

This CL fixes the incorrect usages of the any... matchers. The change was made
using an Error Prone BugChecker and once all the incorrect usages have been
fixed it will be enabled to prevent any other incorrect usages being added in
future.

Cleanup change automatically generated by error-prone refactoring third_party/java_src/mockito/v1_9_5:mockito_any_incorrect_primitive_type on targets <stripped>
