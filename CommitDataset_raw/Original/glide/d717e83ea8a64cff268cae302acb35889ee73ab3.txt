Use the return value of apply when updating RequestManagers' options.

If the RequestOptions object has auto clone enabled, apply() will leave the original object unmodified and return a new mutated copy. Right now RequestManage is ignoring the new mutated copy and retaining the old unmodified object which causes Glide to ignore the applied options.
