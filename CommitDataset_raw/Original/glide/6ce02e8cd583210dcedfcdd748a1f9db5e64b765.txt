Cache bitmaps in lru and mutables in memory

Removes requirement not to use memory cache on
devices that use bitmap recycling because ref
counting prevents us from recyling a bitmap that
is being used for something else (either by
another view or by a cache). Also removes
requirement to pass in bitmap to be recycled to
photo manager, though adds the requirement that
views call acquire and release as they use and
release bitmaps
