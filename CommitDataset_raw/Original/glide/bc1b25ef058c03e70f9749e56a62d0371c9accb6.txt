Support multiple, ordered, nullable thumbnail requests.

I've basically just added a helper method that calls thumbnail()
recursively for you. It seems like it eliminates some of the especially
confusing nested thumbnail logic.

Unfortunately it requires @SuppressWarnings("unchecked") whever it's
used because it uses varags with a parameterized type (RequestBuilder).
I can't currently use @SafeVarargs because that requires a final method.
I can't make the method final without preventing mocking in tests
(minor) and breaking the generated API (major). By splitting out a
separate base class for RequestBuilder I actually probably can fix this
in the future, but that's a pretty substantial change that I don't want
to make right now.
