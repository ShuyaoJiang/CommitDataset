Make InvalidMark an IO rather than a Runtime exception

If we're asked to read partial data (ie a screenshot in Android), we may
read a valid image header but an invalid image body. We should treat
overring our mark as a soft failure, rather than an assertion failure so
that when we fix our mark limit to read the image body, we don't throw
if body is invalid.
