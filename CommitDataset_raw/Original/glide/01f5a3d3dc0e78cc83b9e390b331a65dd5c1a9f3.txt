Key off of the safe key in writeLock in DiskLruCacheWrapper.

The Key weâ€™re given may have a different implementation for equals and hashCode than it does for updateDiskCacheKey. As a result, two different
Key objects that are not equal to each other may produce the same
disk cache key. To avoid simultaneous puts for the same disk cache key
we need to lock on the disk cache key, not the original key object.
