Update Robolectric to head of master -- https://github.com/robolectric/robolectric/commit/b88b2f6be9755ba6b951b78beb784f86776cc432

* Matrix and Parcel are more fully implemented.
* Config properties resource files may be included at any package level to configure Robolectric for related tests.

Several tests depend on the old (broken) Matrix behavior; b/33080703 and b/33078636 track fixing those.
