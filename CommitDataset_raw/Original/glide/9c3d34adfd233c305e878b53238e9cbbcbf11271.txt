Fix extra allocations when marklimit > buffer size

BufferedInputStream would double the buffer size
each time it read from the input stream if
mark limit > buffer size, including the first time
before any data is read. This change prevents the
buffer size from being increased until after at
least one buffer worth of data is read. In turn
this reduces gcs with a large mark limit relative
to the buffer size.
