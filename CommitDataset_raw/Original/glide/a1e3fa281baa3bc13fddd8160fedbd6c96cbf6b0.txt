Only restart full request when restarting requests with thumbnails.

When thumbnail requests finish after full requests complete, we discard
the thumbnail's resource to decrease memory usage and we set the
thumbnails status to complete. When requests are restarted after they
complete, we just call onLoadComplete with whatever resource they had
previously. As a result, thumbnail requests that completed after full
requests were calling onLoadComplete(null), causing spammy error logs
and potentially undesireable calls to onLoadFailed.
