Fixes a bunch of 'any's that should have been 'isA's
isA > any most of the time. isA matches on a non-null instance of the given
class, while any matches *ANYTHING*, even null or an object of a different
class. For example, func(Object obj) could be verified with
func(any(Foo.class)), and even if a Bar is passed in it'll pass.
