Fix exception clearing after onDestroy in a second RequestManager.

Sequence is either:
1. Obtain a RequestManager for a Fragment
2. Wait for Fragment to be destroyed
3. Start a new load with the RequestManager for the destroyed Fragment
4. Clear the new load with the application RequestManager (or any
RequestManager other than the one the load was started with).

Or:
1. Obtain a RequestManager for a Fragment
2. Obtain a RequestBuilder from the Fragment RequestManager
3. Pass the RequestBuilder to a background thread
4. Wait for the Fragment to be destroyed
5. Start a load with the RequestBuilder on the background thread
6. Clear the target returned from submit using the application manager.
