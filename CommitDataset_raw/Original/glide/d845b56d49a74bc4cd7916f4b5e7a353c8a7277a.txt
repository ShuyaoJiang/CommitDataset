Only look at image loading to determine animations

Currently we only treat an image as having been 
loaded from cache (and therefore eligible to skip
an animation) if we can both determine the size of
the target the image is being loaded into and load
the image synchronously. This can lead to bugs
in collections where views may use match_parent or
layout weights resulting in near synchronous loads
being treated as asynchronous.
