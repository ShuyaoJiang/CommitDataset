Obtain the correct size Bitmap in TransformationUtils.roundedCorners.

Previously we were obtaining the requested image size. The requested
image size is ignored in roundedCorners because the transformation 
doesnâ€™t scale. As a result we were weirdly stretching the image with
some combinations of image and requested dimensions.

Fixes #2472.
