Gracefully allow Volley to be optionally excluded

Uses new factories to manage Volley singleton to
reduce Glide's dependence on Volley. New package
means we can easily exclude not just Volley, but
also our classes that depend on it when Volley is
being excluded. We also can check to see if Volley
is present at runtime and register a factory that
simply throws an exception if we try to fetch a
url, instead of throwing an exceptionw henever we
tried to fetch a model that optionally might try
to fetch a url (like a string or uri).
