Override placeholder/error/fallback equivalents when id or drawable is set.

Glide will always check for a placeholder/error/fallback drawable first
and only check the id equivalents if the drawable is null. Previously,
when setting a placeholder/errror/fallback id on a RequestOptiosn
object, we did not unset the drawable equivalents. As a result, it
wasn't previously possible to replace a placeholder/error/fallback
drawable by setting the equivalent id.

After this change any calls to placeholder/error/fallback will always
replace previous calls, regardless of whether and id or drawable is
provided.

Fixes #3068.
