Add a factory implementation for DiskCacheAdapter.

We're trying to keep people from setting DiskCache implementations
directly on Glide's Builder during initialization because creating
caches often requires reading from Files and other expensive I/O. The
method to set a disk cache is deprecated in favor of one that accepts a
factory. Some people want to disable the disk cache entirely, so they
use DiskCacheAdapter. Without a Factory, it's less obvious how they're
supposed to do so if we remove the deprecated method.
