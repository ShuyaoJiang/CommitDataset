Add resources that are dereferenced but not released to the cache.

Previously resources that were dereferenced but not released vanished
into the ether. As a result you could load a Bitmap and then immediately
after load the same Bitmap again and get a memory cache miss on the
second load. This pattern is particularly common with the submit() APIs
that load images on background threads where the Target is neither
referenced by a view nor referenced directly.

Fixes #2560
