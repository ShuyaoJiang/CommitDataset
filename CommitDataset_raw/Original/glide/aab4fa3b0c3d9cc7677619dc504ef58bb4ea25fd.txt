Spring Cleaning
Mostly javac/LINT/gradle/IDEA warnings, typos, and consistency fixes.

Detailed Global changes:
 * Fix some JavaDoc formatting issues (e.g. broken links)
 * Fix some JavaDoc build issues (inner class ctor links were broken)
 * Fix mis-typed words that caused grammatical issues
 * Fix Gradle deprecation warning during build
 * Make samples' build.gradle files more similar
 * Remove redundant <uses-sdk> from manifest

Mostly test related classes:
 * Add some generic arguments where missing
 * Add @TargetApi annotations to test code to suppress LINTs
 * Reduce the scope of suppressions or remove them completely
 * Use some specialized mocking/matching methods to reduce uncheckedness

GIF related classes:
 * Reduce number of magic constants, name them
 * Add some documentation from the standard for the constants
 * Remove some meaningless comments
 * Convert most inline comments to JavaDocs
 * Add annotations for ints designating color/status/etc (int is too overloaded)
