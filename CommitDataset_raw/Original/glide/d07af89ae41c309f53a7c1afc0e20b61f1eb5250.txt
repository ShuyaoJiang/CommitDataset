Halve the number of hardware bitmaps we use on Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge devices.

There's some issue that appears to affect these device models. I don't
have a complete list, but the top 5 are all variations of S7 edge and
make up more than 75% of the crashes we've received so far.

Ideally this would be done as an experiment, but there's no reasonable
way to make that change in Glide without piping through additional APIs,
so this seems like a reasonable first step.
