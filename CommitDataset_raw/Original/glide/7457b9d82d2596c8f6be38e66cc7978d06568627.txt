Use Dagger 2.11 in imgur sample (#2425)

* Remove unneeded excludes from imgur sample
jsr305 is repackaged, so there won't be a conflict on annotationProcessor classpath

* Increment Dagger version to 2.11
There are breaking API changes (renames) and use the new API to reduce custom code.

* Further simplify injection by using the Dagger library components
