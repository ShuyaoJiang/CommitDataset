Removes Math.round() call when the argument is an integer or a long.

Math.round() called with an integer or long type can result in loss of information because it coerces the argument to a float before rounding back to an int.

If this CL introduces an explicit saturated cast from long to int, you may want to remove the cast if it wasn't desired. If so, please make a suggestion to remove the cast in this CL.

NOTE: Review carefully. If the original code contained the pattern Math.round(a/b), there's a good chance the original author wanted a floating-point division with round-to-nearest instead of the integer division with round-to-zero that they got.

This an automated fix using Error Prone ([] We intend to make this a compilation error in Blaze's Java compiler, so it is necessary to fix existing occurrences first to avoid breaking builds.
