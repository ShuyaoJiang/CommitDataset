Fix precomps that are time stretched and longer than their parent

It is possible to create an composition and then precomp it into a
shorter composition but time stretch it down to fit the new shorter
duration. In this case, at the end of the animation, the progress
for the precomped layer will be > 1 because its frames extend
past the end of the original composition. This fixes a keyframe
from clipping at 1 to clipping at its actual end duration which
may be > 1.
