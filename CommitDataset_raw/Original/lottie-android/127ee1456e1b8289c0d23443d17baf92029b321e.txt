Extract more factory classes (#139)

Another change for #3

Pretty mechanical and straightforward change. Extracted a bunch of constructors into more static inner factory classes with a newInstance method by convention.
Later on we can pull out all these factories into a separate module that provides the default json parsing implementation.
