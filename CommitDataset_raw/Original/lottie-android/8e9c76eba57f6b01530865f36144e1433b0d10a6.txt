Cleaned up and updated LottieComposition factory methods (#593)

### Added
* `LottieAnimationView#setComposition(JsonReader)`
* `LottieAnimationView#setComposition(String jsonString)`
### Removed
* `LottieComposition#fromJson(Resources, JSONObject)`. Replaced with one that takes a String and one that takes a JsonReader.
### Deprecated
* `LottieAnimationView#setComposition(JSONObject)`

This also removes context/resources as a parameter from several methods because it is not needed anymore.
