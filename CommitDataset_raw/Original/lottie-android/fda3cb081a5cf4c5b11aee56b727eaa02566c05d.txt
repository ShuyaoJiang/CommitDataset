Add setRepeatMode API (#525)


This PR allows you to define what an animation should do when it reaches the end. This setting is applied only when the loop is enabled.

The supported values are:
LottieDrawable.RESTART - The animation restarts from the beginning.
LottieDrawable.REVERSE - The animation plays backward (and then forward again).
The default behavior is to restart the animation.

You can use the new lottie_repeatMode XML attribute to set this value too
