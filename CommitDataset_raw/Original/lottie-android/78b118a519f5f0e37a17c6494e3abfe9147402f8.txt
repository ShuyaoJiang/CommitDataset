Fix sample app on Android below Lollipop (#258)

It was crashing for two reasons:

Some TextViews were using vector drawables as compound drawables
Fixed by getting the drawables with AppCompatDrawableManager and
setting them programmatically

Some vector drawables are referencing other vector drawables
(example: ic_invert references ic_invert_black)
Fixed by calling AppCompatDelegate.setCompatVectorFromResourcesEnabled(true)
