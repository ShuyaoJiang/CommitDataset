Refactoried the way progress is handled in LottieDrawable and LottieValueAnimator

Previously, progress was held in both the drawable and animator. This made things
really confusing when min and max progresses were set both because they are in both
places and because of the difference between animated fraction and animated value.
This refactors progress to be wholly owned by the animator.
Fixes #448
