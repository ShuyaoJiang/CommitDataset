LottieCompositionFactory and Caching Cleanup (#959)

This cleans up a number of things related to the LottieCompositionFactory.
It:

* Handled task caching at the LottieCompositionFactory level so it is guaranteed to work everywhere. The existing architecture left several instances where compositions would not be cached.
* Simplified the way tasks are handled in LottieAnimationView
* Fixes #958 in which different cache keys are used for rawRes animations
* Removed deprecated factory APIs
