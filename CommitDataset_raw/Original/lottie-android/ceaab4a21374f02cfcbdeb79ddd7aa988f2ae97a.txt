[Breaking] Added support for ColorFilter value callbacks (#566)

This is a breaking change. All previous ColorFilter APIs have been removed and should now migrate to use the new API.

To migrate:
layer + content -> `new KeyPath(layerName, "**", contentName);`
layer -> `new KeyPath(layerName, "**");`
everything -> `new KeyPath("**");`

It will be slightly more efficient to use a fully qualified name rather than a globbed version.
