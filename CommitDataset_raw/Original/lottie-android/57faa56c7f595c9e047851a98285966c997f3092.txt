Major refactor of observables and parenting (#18)

Removed Obervable completely in favor of animation listeners. Previously, a single observable was used in the model layer which prevented a Composition from being reused since the Observable would be reused too... This should allow Composition caching.

As part of the change, I redid how parenting works and removed the need for ParentLayer or ChildContainerLayers which should be a big win for simplicity.

Also created some better toString methods.

TODO: the end of LoopPlayOnce is broken. It will be fixed in a subsequent PR.
