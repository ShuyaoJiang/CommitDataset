Fixed danglign choreographer callback. (#775)

**This patch fixes the performance issue.**

I've seen the cases where the previous version of the code was re-adding callbacks to the choreographer in case of cancelation/pause. Now it is designed to make it impossible. It looks like there is a copy of the callbacks stored somewhere in the stack. I've been able to reproduce the problem on Android 6.0 and 7.0.

This issue caused application performance degradation and battery drain in the background for us.
