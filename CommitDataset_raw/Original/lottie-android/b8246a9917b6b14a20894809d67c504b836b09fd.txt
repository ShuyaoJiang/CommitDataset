Reverse the iteration direction for keyframe finding

Bodymovin only specifies start time for a frame. The end time of
the previous frame cam be implied to be immediately before that.
During keyframe creation, we set the end frame of a keyframe to
the start frame of the next one. However, that means that if we
iterate forward to find a keyframe, if you are exactly at the
beginning of a keyframe, it will be detected at the end of a keyframe
rather than the beginning of the next one.

This also fixes an end frame calculate which was one too short
for layers with in out animations.
