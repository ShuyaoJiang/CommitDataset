Use save and restore instead of manually restoring clipRect

Views/drawables/canvases are not supposed to be able to expand their
clip rect so that views can properly clip their children.
See these docs for more info: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Canvas.html#clipRect(android.graphics.RectF, android.graphics.Region.Op)

We were relying on undesired behavior before to restore the clip
rect which seemed to work fine for software accelerated canvases
but not hardware accelerated ones. Swiching to save/restore is not
only more accurate but fixes clipping issues.
Fixes #457
