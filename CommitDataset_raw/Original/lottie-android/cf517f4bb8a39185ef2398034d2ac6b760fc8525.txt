Significant improvement in matte and mask performance (#130)

This is a very significant milestone in masks and mattes.
* Reduces dropped frames by 25-60% for animations with masks or mattes from my testing.
* Reduces memory usage by up to 300% due to allocating 1 bitmap instead of 3+.
* Vastly simpler code to read. Layers can now handle their mask and matte bitmaps on their own. This fixed several issues with masked and matted precomps automatically.

I'm not sure what the deal with mask and matte screenshot tests are. They look fine on a device but are missing sections in the screenshot.
