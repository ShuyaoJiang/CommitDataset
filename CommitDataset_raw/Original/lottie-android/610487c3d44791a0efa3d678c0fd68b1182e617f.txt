Significant animator overhaul (#496)

This is the second major LottieValueAnimator overhaul. The first one wound up being overly complex and didn't work great. This cleans up the logic and adds a bunch of unit tests.

This is a breaking change because it removes some confusing APIs such as resumeReverseAnimation. You now just set a negative speed and call resumeAnimation
