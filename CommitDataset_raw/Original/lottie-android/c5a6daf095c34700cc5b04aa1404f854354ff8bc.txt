Pull out LottieComposition factory methods into inner class (#137)

This is part of issue #3. Pulled static factory methods out of LottieComposition into a static inner class. Made all fields final and initialized them all in the constructor.
This will make it easier for follow up refactors where we'll modularize the parsing logic and make it pluggable.
Also upgraded the Espresso tests to JUnit 4 so it no longer uses the deprecated ActivityInstrumentationTestCase2
