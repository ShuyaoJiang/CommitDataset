Improve the performance of mattes and masks 200-1000+%  (#201)

The largest performance bottleneck for mattes and masks was the saveLayer call that redirected rendering to an offscreen buffer.

Perviously, it would call saveLayer with the entire bounds of the layer. However, it now actually measures layer bounds and only saves that small region. All compositions with a mask or matte should see a very significant performance improvement. For animations with small masks or mattes on a large composition or many masks and mattes, the improvements could be even greater.

Some of my test animations went from 5 to 30+ fps.
