Fixed a bug with path animations on Jellybean

PointF didn't have an `equals(PointF other)` method until jb-mr2.
Prior to that, you had to use `equals(float x, float y)`. This
broke path animations which relied on that method.
This commit uses the backwards compatible `equals(float x, float y)`
method.

Fixes #227
