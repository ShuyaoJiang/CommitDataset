Allow multiple trim paths to operate on the same content (#1103)

Without this, multiple trim paths would overwrite each other. In the case of #1087, there was a trim path inside the content group and outside of it. However, the outside one had the desired visual effect but was overwritten by the one inside the group which had no effect.
Fixes #1087
