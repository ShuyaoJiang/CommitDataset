Round a frame when setting a value and retrieving a frame

Previously, frames were casted to ints/logs. However, this caused
them to be successaptable to floating point issues in which a frame
may be 49.99998 and rounded down to 49. Rounding the number should
produce more reliable frame calculations.
Fixes #591
