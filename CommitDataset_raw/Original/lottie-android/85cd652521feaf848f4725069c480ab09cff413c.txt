Add support for rendering fonts and dynamic text (#353)

This support builds on text glyph support by supporting rendering custom fonts as well as custom text through a text delegate. This enables Lottie to be used with translations as well as interactive animations.

All text operations such as fills, strokes, tracking, etc are supported by this.
