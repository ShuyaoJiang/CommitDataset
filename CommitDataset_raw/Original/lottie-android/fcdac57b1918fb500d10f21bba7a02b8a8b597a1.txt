Allow animations with masks and mattes to scale up

Previously, animations were given a max scale due to saveLayer,
which is used for mattes and masks, only saving the canvas size.
This is problematic when the scale makes the animations larger
than the view because the masks and mattes get clipped. This gets
around that by scaling up the animation up until the size of the
view then scaling the canvas with the remaining scale.
