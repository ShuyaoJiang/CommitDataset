Do not leak body in intermediate buffers to converters

Multiple calls to source() would create a new BufferedSource which, when a single byte was read, would cache data in its buffer which would be lost on a subsequent call to source(). Calls to source() will now always return the same BufferedSource ensuring data cannot be lost.
