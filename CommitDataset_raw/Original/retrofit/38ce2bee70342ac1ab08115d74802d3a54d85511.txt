Use execute() instead of enqueue() in Rx adapter

Retrofit should leave threading up to the Scheduler used to invoke call().

Otherwise, there can be two types of unwanted behavior:

1. It can execute on another Thread when sync behavior is desired.

2. It uses unnecessary extra Threads even when already called on a Scheduler.
