Changes to Javadoc to remove doclint errors and warnings

JDK 8 introduced doclint to the javadoc tool:
http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/172

Unfortunately, this causes deployments to fail under JDK 8, due
to javadoc doclint errors.

Not all warning messages were removed, but `mvn javadoc:jar` now
completes without an early failure.

Further discussion will be required to decide on how to approach the
doclint warnings.
