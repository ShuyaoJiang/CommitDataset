Fatal errors should crash the dispatcher thread

This is an imperfect fix as uncaught exceptions reaching OkHttpCall which are not fatal still only log, but most of the adapters are defending against anything getting this far already.

Also contained is a fix for the RxJava 2 async adapter. Non-200 responses delivered to the body observer would be forwarded to onError. If that callback threw a fatal exception, it would be re-delivered to the body observer despite it having already called a downstream terminal method. The fatal error should have been propagated by the async observer instead of attempting to make its way back downstream.
