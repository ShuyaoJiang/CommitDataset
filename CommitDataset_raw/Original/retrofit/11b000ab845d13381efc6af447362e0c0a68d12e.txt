Apply the interceptor tape at the time of subscription.

Previously the tape would only be applied when the Observable itself was created. This is counter to what you want since the Observable is a representation of an API call but not an actual invocation.

Since the tape is now applied at the time of subscription, the Observable can be long-lived while still behaving like a synchronous API call. Additionally, consumers of the Observable API that immediately called subscribe receive the same interceptor behavior since it's on the same thread.
