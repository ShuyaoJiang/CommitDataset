Resolve mixed-content resources

Most if not all contemporary browsers default to blocking mixed-content
resources [1]. The immediate effect of this is that the latest library
version number isn't retrieved because jQuery is blocked. This commit
ensures external content is served over HTTPS. It does not change other
HTTP links to resources that are available over HTTPS.
