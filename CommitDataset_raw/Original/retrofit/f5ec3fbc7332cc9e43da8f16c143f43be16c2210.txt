This was unsafe for switching between development and production
backends. This is because requests that are triggered on a UI thread
may be delayed in execution on a background thread. These could cause
requests created for a development environment to be executed against
a production environment, or vice-versa.

Retrofit is the wrong layer for switching backends for load balancing
or proximity. That can happen in an OkHttp interceptor instead.
