Refactorings (#2789)

* Encapsulate ServiceMethod creation inside the type

This will allow subtypes to be returned in the future.

* Rename one-letter type parameters to be more descriptive

Fun fact: this type and its builder were using R and T to mean the opposite things. :facepalm:

* Make the ServiceMethod entirely responsible for invocation

This way a base class can be exposed to the reflection-y bits and subtypes for different styles of requests can be implemented as subtypes.
