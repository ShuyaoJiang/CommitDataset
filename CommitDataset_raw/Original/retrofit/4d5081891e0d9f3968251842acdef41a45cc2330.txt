Abstract HTTP client behind interfaces.

Move the HTTP client implementation behind interfaces which allow
for its substitution. A `Client` is a one-method class which takes a
`Request` object, executes an HTTP request represented by it
synchronously, and returns a `Response` object representing the HTTP
response entirely.

Since this is such a fundamental change all of the tests which interact
with and verify the client have been rewritten from scratch.

This commit also changes two behaviors which were previously present:

 * Implicit, form-encoded request bodies are no longer supported. Extra
   `@Named` params on a method is now invalid.
 * Multi-part requests are no longer implicit. Methods which submit
   multi-part request bodies must be annotated with `@Multipart`.
