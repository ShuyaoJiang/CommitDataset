Support JSR-330 instead of Guice.

This change is *extremely* backwards and forwards incompatible
because it replaces Guice's @Named with JSR-330's @Named.
Programs that use the wrong @Named will not work at all. For
this reason it's critical that clients of retrofit also change
their @Named in sync with this update.
