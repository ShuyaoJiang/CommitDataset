Some error checking put in. When a new network is created and the
connection fails, an alert message is displayed, and connection
attempts cease.  Retrying with a correct barcode works.  Not perfect
yet, but in my testing I have found this version much better than the
previous setup: at least errors are detected and the user is informed.
