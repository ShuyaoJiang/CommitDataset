Port r1623 changes to C++

This provide C++ support for Hanzi from issue 582. With it the C++
qrcode blackbox test results again match the Java results.

The changes are mostly a re-port of various pieces of the Java code
for supporting modes and bit stream parsing in QR codes. It expands
the modes/parsing including ECI and FNC, refactors StringUtils as was
done in Java, and makes DecoderResult include the fields that the Java
code has.

Although the non-qrcode blackbox tests don't all match the Java code
(a known issue) the entire blackbox suite was run under valgrind and
has no errors, including invalid memory references and leaks.

This commit also includes a few cleanups for things like files that
had mixed line endings, i.e., a combination of LF and CR-LF.
