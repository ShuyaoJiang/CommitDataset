1. Set up all strings in res/*/strings.xml rather than as string
   literals.
2. Using a very handy script for this purpose, and checking it
   into utils/ since it saved me some headache.
3. Turned tabs -> spaces for WifiResultHandler.
4. Better error handling on network types: look for exact matches
   rather than substrings.
