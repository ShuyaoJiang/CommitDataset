Used IntelliJ's amazing refactoring functions to change the argument ordering of ByteMatrix. I want to standardize this across ZXing: the first component should always be horizontal and the second vertical, whether supplying an x, y point or a width, height pair. Also, we should always use x and y as variables with x being the horizontal component to avoid confusion.
