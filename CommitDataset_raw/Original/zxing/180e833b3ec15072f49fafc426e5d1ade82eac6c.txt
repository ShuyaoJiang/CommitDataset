Improved approach to 1D decoding -- better use of integer math by scaling pattern ratios up to expected number of pixels, rather than the other way. Modified constants accordingly. Also introduced notion of maxium variance that any one bar in a pattern can have and stiill be accepted. Finally, adjusted false-positives test failure limit downward due to recent improvements.
