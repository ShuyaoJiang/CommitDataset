Changed how many rows we scan while detecting QR finder patterns. The mobile case dynamically calculates this based on the height of the image, and ranges from a small speedup to a big difference for large inputs. Also changed the try harder case to scan every 3rd line for a 3x speedup. The unit tests have the same success rate as before: 16/20 on qr1, 10/10 on qr2.
