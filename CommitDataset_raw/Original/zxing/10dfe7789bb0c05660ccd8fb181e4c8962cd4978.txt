- Got the DataMatrix decoder compiling again with a quick bandaid.
- Fixed two bugs in the LocalBlockBinarizer sharpening routine. It can now decode 2132 images in our blackbox tests, compared to 2103 using the global histogram approach.
- Added the PDF 417 blackbox test to AllPositiveBlackBoxTester, and allowed it to complete even if the tests fail.
