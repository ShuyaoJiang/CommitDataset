- Converted parts of the PDF 417 reader to use BitMatrix.
- Changed the PDF 417 detector to search the image more broadly, instead of assuming the barcode starts in the left 1/4 and ends in the right 1/4. We now get 8/23 on the real-world blackbox test, and we'll probably do even better with further improvements here.
- Added a quiet zone to two of the unit test images and updated a golden result for one of them. We now get 3/7 on the first test.
- Tried to fix some bugs in the upside down code but it still doesn't work.
