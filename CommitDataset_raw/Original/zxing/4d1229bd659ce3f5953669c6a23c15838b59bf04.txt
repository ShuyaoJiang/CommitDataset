Created a library of images which do not contain barcodes, or contain barcodes we don't yet support. Wrote a new unit test designed to identify false positives, and set a benchmark which we can improve over time. Out of these 26 images, tested in all four rotations, we currently find 44/104 false positives. The Code 39 decoder in particular seems to be too lenient.
