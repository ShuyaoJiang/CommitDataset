- Fixed a crash when parsing a particular VCard with a blank entry.
- Trimmed whitespace around many fields to sanitize the results (this is very useful upstream, for example we hyphenate phone numbers on Android but can't tolerate extra whitespace).
- Fixed a bug with 1D result points when scanning upside down - they needed to be mirrored to draw correctly.
