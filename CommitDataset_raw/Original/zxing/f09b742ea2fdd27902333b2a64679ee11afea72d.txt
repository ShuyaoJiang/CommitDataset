* Throw the actual exception objects, rather than pointers to them, i.e.:
  - replace |throw new FooException()| with |throw FooException()|
  - replace |catch (FooException *ex)| with |catch (FooExceptio ex)|
  - update all uses of caught exceptions appropriately:
    . replace |ex->foo| with |ex.foo|
    . remove all attempts to delete the caught exception(s)
* Add 'const' to the 'char *' declarations for character encoding names
