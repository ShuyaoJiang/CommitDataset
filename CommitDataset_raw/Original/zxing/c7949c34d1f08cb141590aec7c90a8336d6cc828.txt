Added rudimentary handling of address information. Since we can't really parse
it into the detailed format the iPhone's Address Book API wants, we punt a bit
and instead just break it into multiple pieces, each on a separate line, and
store that as the 'street' part of the 'Home' address for the contact we're
creating. That way, at least the information is captured rather than lost, and
the user can sync it to their computer, copy-and-paste it into the appropriate
fields, and then sync it back to the iPhone. Not idea, but better than 
nothing, which is what we had before.
