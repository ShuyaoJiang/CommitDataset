- Added Joseph's excellent supermarket checkout beep. There seems to be a bug in the M3 framework where it sometimes plays twice or hiccups.
- Changed the status bar to flash green for a second when the result points are drawn.
- Added install as a target to the build file.
- Fixed a crashing bug when decoding from preview mode (driver problem).
