Fix a few issues in test raised by the stricter gcc flags. Closes issue 1085.

- Some of the cpp tests still fail to compile, but that's covered in issue 1066.
- I tweaked the SConscript to be a little happier with OS X and cppunit and imagemagick
in /opt/local.  These should be benign on other systems but let me know if they aren't
and I'll back tweak them or back them out.
