Decent speed improvement for HybridBinarizer::calculateBlackPoints().  The
approach is to stop testing for min/max values once the dynamic range
condition is satisfied.

On "typical" images, the function is about 20% faster.  Worst-case images
(low contrast images) can be slower but they are less likely to be read
successfully.

This change makes no change to test results, only performance.
