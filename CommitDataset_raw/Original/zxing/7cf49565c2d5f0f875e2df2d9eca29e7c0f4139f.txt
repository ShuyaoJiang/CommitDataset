Simplified pieces of code (#601)

* Simplify code in bit-twiddling methods, using APIs introduced in Java 5.

* Align code by adjusting whitespace and adding `+0`.

* Convert qrcode DataMask to enum to reduce source code size, which shouldn't change behavior.

* Simplify lists of character constants using string initializer instead of array.

* Remove redundant `+ 0` operations from a recent change.

* Delete the function DataMask.forReference() and inline the logic into all its callers.
