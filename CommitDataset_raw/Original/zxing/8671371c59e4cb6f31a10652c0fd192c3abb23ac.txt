Did a big refactoring on the MonochromeBitmapSource. I removed all the caching luminance calls and converted them to getting luminance data on demand. This saved another 33,000 function calls per rejected scan, good for another 15 ms savings. I also moved the luminance calls to BaseMonochromeBitmapSource and made them protected, to indicate that the decoders shouldn't use them.

Overall the recent optimizations took one rejected scan from 307 to 135 ms, which is definitely noticeable.

WARNING: I am not able to build the Bug or J2ME clients, but I believe they are correct.
