Improve detector logic to throw out false positive finder patterns in a more reasonable manner. Current logic didn't quite achieve its goal in some corner cases and needed rethinking and some simplification. Fixes a reported failure from the group list. Net change in passed test cases is -1 otherwise (for 270 degree rotation -- not vital) so I consider it a net tiny win.
