- Added the version number to the about box in a robust way which will not get stale.
- Moved the Book Search user agent into that class, which will continue to get stale, but never belonged in the XML, as it does not need translation.
- Added a try/catch block around firing off intents, and an error dialog, so that we don't crash on bad  intents like TEL: in the future (even though that particular one was fixed in core).
