Cleaned up previous commit

Following Sean Owen's suggestions, I cleaned up my code in the Aztec
decoder and its tests as follows:

1. Made convertBoolArrayToByteArray() package-private.
2. Replaced my own assertEqualByteArrays() with existing
   assertArrayEquals().
3. Replaced C-style array declarations with more Javaish ones.
