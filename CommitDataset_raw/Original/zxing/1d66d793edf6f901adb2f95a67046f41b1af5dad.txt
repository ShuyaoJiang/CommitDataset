asterisk isn't a valid character and should not be encoded as content with Code 39. (#872)

* asterisk isn't a valid character which can be encoded with Code 39.
the following sample content results in an unreadable barcode: *123456789
because the asterisk is the start-stop character (special meaning, not valid in content)
the really encoded value is **123456789*. The barcode reader stops after reading the second asterisk
and throw the content away.

* remove wrong private modifier for ALPHABET_STRING

* cleanup comments
