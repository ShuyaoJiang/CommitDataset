Ported and rewrote the Renderer unit test to test QRCodeWriter. We encode several barcodes looking for good behavior, and several others which are compared pixel by pixel to golden results stored in PNGs. I'm happy to say we nail the three images Satoru created to the dot!

Along the way, I added support for encoder hints, and no longer hardcode the error correction level.
