Added a bit of defensive programming in the AlignmentPattern code. There were real world examples where the width passed to AlignmentPatternFinder was zero, which causes BitArray to throw when built with a size of zero. I'm going a little bit farther and not searching extremely small areas either.

Sean, please review.
