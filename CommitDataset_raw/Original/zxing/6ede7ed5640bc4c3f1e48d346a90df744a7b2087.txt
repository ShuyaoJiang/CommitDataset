[iphone] now decoders need to be injected into ZXingWidgetController to enhance performance when only a few readers are needed. One exc bad access bug solved. A few minor bugs remain in ScanTest. 1st status bar does not reappear when success of scan. this one should be easy to fix. 2nd ScanTest does not display the results when scan success for the first time, but only second time. This second bug is strange
