Added a new feature to the test app, which captures all the device info and default camera parameters, then bundles them up into an email. This will make it very easy to get some important info about new devices from users (e.g. the HTC Hero which I don't have).

Also did a lot of other cleanup, added an about box, and prepared the app to be released on the Market.
