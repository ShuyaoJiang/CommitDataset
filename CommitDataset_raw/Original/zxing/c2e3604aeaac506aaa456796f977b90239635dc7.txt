1. Instead of killing the activity when done, load up a URL in a browser instead.
2. More error checking:
   a. Missing SSID
   b. Incorrect network type (hey, it's just a string, and the user could get creative)

TODOs:
1. Localize the strings this is introducing.
2. Errors not handled:
   a. Tell if network not found.
   b. Incorrect SSID codes still crash the app: WIFI:S:winders;T:WPA;P:secret;badjunk;;
   c. For an open network, giving a password crashes:  WIFI:S:winders;T:nopass;P:secret;;
3. When connected, it should say, "Connected to <ssid>".
