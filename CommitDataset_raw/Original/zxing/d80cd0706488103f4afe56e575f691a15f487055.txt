Made a change to the QR detector which cuts the worst case rejection time from 300 ms to 160 ms, with almost no penalty in decoding ability. Given that we're emphasizing continuous decoding, I feel it's much better to reject the occasional borderline image in half the time, and get on with the next scan.
