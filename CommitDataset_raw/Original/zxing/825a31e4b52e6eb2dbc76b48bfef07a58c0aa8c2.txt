Ignore additional PDF417 barcode rows

Some barcode generators (e.g. Okapi) seem to generate additional barcode
rows at the end of the barcode, which can be decoded as valid barcode
rows, but actually contain garbage. The barcode metadata states that
these additional rows are not part of the barcode. So we ignore those
addional rows when parsing the barcode. This could potentially also
happen (though quite unlikely) if data after the barcode looks like a
barcode row.
