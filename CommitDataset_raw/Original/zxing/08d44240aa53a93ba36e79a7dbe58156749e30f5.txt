Modified the library entry point in a way which lets continuous scan clients reuse the same decoding objects at each pass. This is source and semantically compatible with the previous version, so you have to choose to call decodeWithState() to get the benefits. The unit tests cannot use this because they test each image in normal and then try harder mode, which requires changing the hints object.
