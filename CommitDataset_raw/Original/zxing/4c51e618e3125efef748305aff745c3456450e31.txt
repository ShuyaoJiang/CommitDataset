C++ Port:
- Fixed to be able to build for the Symbian emulator (variable-sized arrays cannot be created on the stack).
- Fixed bug only present on Symbian phones that prevented the alignment patterns from being found (the Symbian implementation of valarray does not initialize its values to 0, unless it is explicitly specified as the default value).
- Fixed an include.
