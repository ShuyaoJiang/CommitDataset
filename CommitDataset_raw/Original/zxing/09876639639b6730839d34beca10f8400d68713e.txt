Added some simple sharpening for 1D decoding which allowed a couple more blackbox images to pass. There were a few cases where the format or content is now misdetected, but since the net gain was positive I decided to make those non-fatal errors. In real world use the sharpening seems to help, and I think we can do even better with a better algorithm.
