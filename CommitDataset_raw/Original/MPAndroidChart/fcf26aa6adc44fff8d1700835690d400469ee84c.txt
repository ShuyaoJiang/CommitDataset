Eliminate allocs - PointD pooling (#1892)

Replace all "new PointD()" instantiations with PointD.getInstance() / PointD.recycleInstance() pairs. Helper methods overloaded to include void return / output PointD variable signatures.  Old methods remain as convenience, with notations that they return recyclable instances.
