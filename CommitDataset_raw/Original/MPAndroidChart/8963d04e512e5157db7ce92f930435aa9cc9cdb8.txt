Add javadocs to artifacts

Also removed `deploy.gradle` which was added in #20 since it was unused and
moved the relevant javadoc targets to `build.gradle` instead.

Jitpack will host javadocs for you if a javadocs jar is built. The URL ends up
being something like: https://jitpack.io/com/github/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/v2.1.0/javadoc/

Fixes #835
