More Linting

Lots of things in the example app are now marked with the 'final' modifier, and saveToGallery() is protected in classes that implement it. As well, new suppressions are in a few places.

NEW text is now removed completely. Looks like this has been unused for a long time and it's just stuck around anyway.
