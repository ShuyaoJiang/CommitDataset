docs(README): Update & simplify README

- Re-ordered some of the sections
- Simplified some sections
- Reformatted here and there
- Added a few emojis, how cute!

The goal of this change was to hopefully further reduce the amount of
issue support/ question spam. By moving the sections around to show the
more important parts higher up, like usage and documentation links, I
hope this will make it easier for people to find the documentation.
