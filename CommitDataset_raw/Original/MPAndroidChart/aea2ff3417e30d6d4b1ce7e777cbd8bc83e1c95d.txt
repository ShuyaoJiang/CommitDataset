Add option to set minimum angles

Allows to force minimum slice angles when drawing charts, which means that any
slices with angles lower than the minimum will be drawn with the minimum angle.

When changing this setting on the fly, you have to call
`notifyDataSetChanged()` and `invalidate()` for the minimum angle to take
effect.

This only functions if all slices can be drawn with the minimum angle. For
example if a chart has 5 slices, the largest functioning minimum angle is
`72f` degrees on a 360 degree chart, or 20% of the chart's `maxAngle`.
