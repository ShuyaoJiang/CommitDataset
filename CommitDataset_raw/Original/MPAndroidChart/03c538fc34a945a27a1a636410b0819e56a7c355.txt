docs(templates): Update Issue & PR templates

I've updated the issue and pull request templates, again. This time I
looked to the node.js request library for inspiration.

It's no secret that this project has been attracting a LOT of very
low-quality issues. Almost all are asking questions that can be easily
answered if the person looked at the example project or the wiki.

Specifically, the new Support_help.md file.

This file will hopefully bait these low-quality support questions and
reduce the number of opened issues regarding debugging or support
significantly.

I've updated the default ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md to be a copy of Bug_report.md
to force people to read that notice text if they decide to not choose
any of the templates.
