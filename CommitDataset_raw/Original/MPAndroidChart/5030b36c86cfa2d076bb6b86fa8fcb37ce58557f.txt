More Cleanup

I've removed the realm examples, mainly because the library was buggy.
In the previous commit, I already removed the examples from the list
since they didn't add anything to the overall demonstration. I thought
that if anyone wants to use realm.io with the charts, they can see the
actual library.

The file structure has been updated to match how Android Studio does
things. Some files added way back when have been deleted as they don't
do anything but cause the linter to freak out about 'unused properties'

All 'build.gradle' files have been refreshed as well.

Small addition to the README file to add a quick way to reach sections
of the page.
