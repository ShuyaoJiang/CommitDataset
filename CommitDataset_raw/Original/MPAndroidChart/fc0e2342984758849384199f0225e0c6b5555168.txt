Remove Deprecated Things

Long deprecated Legend constructor and positioning has been removed, it was
replaced with a new way to position the Legend.

The old Easing options have been removed now, accessing them is as easy as
removing the `EasingOption` part, such that the names look like
`Easing.Linear` or `Easing.EaseInOutQuad` now.
