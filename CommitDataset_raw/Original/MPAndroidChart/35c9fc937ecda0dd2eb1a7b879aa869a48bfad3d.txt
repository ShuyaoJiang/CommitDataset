refactor(EasingFunction): Simplified EasingFunction

EasingFunction has been simplified greatly, and I've added a MUCH needed
annotation to relevant methods.

Easing.EasingOptions has been deprecated, as well as any methods using
them. Converting is as simple as deleting the "EasingOptions" part.

A new signature is available for animateXY()!

You are now able to pass one EasingFunction to animateXY() if you want
both axes to be animated the same way.

Quietly included are some gradle build updates, incrementing the
appcompat version to 27.1.1, and using the new `javacompiler` to avoid
deprecation of `javacompile`
