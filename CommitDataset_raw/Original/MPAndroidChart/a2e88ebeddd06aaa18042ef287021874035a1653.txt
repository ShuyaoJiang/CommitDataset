    Changing ScatterShape from ENUM to HashMap of String .
    Creating a provider which provides ShapeRenderer.
    Creating CustomShapeRenderers imlementing ShapeRender with different renderShape() method
    Replacing the Switch Statement by ShapeRenderer.renderShape();

    => Better OOP implementation. Scalable easily.
     To add new Shape you only need to create a class implementing ShapeRenderer and override renderShape method and then add the class in the provider ScatterChart.registerShapeRenderer(String scatterShapeName, ShapeRenderer shapeRenderer).
