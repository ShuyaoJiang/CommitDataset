Support for Android Gradle Plugin 3.3.

Android Gradle Plugin 3.3 includes direct bytecode generation of the R
class in libraries, which breaks previous R2 generator as it relies on
the generated source.

Switch to reading the symbol table (R.txt), dropping support for plugins
before 3.1, where the internal getter for the symbol table was moved.

Filed https://issuetracker.google.com/118668005 to introduce an API in
the Android Gradle Plugin to avoid the use of internal classes.
