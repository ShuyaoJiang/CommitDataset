Suppress unexpected exception in Previewer

Required views that were not found were calling a method that throws an
UnsupportedOperationException when in the Android Studio Previewer
(due to Previewer's use of BridgeResources). A check is now performed
to ensure that the view is not in Edit Mode before calling this method.
