proguard configuration change

The whole injector needs to be kept, as we experienced in another project: https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo/commit/b64fa6b76fa9bb84a185dabb95988f7ab0b7655b

With the old "keepclassmembers", we experienced NPEs accessing viewholder instances. Those are gone with the config change.
