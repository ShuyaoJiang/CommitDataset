Improve Spring Resource Handling support

This commit improves support of the Resource Handling features
introduced in Spring Framework 4.1. Those features add new ways to
resolve and transform static resources in applications.
See [this blog
post](https://spring.io/blog/2014/07/24/spring-framework-4-1-handling-static-web-resources)
for more details.

The `ResourceUrlEncodinFilter` is added for compatible template engines:
Velocity and Thymeleaf. It assists them with rewriting the URLs of
static resources when rendering templates.

New keys are added in the `ResourceProperties` in order to configure
the Resource Handling chain. `ResourceResolvers` and
`ResourceTransformers` are registered accordingly in
`WebMvcAutoConfiguration`.

Here is an example of enabling a `ContentVersionStrategy` on all
static resources, meaning their names will be changed for cache
busting purposes by adding a content hash at the end of the file name.
Like "/js/jquery.js -> /js/jquery-872ca6a9fdda9e2c1516a84cff5c3bc6.js".

```
spring.resources.chain.enabled:true
spring.resources.chain.strategy.content.enabled:true
spring.resources.chain.strategy.content.paths:/**
```
