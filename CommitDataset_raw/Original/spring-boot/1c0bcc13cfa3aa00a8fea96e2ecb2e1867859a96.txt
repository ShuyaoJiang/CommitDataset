Set UserDetailsService in default AuthenticationManagerBuilder

Only affects the default AuthenticationManagerBuilder (so when users
are not overriding the default global user details). Makes the
UserDetailsService effectively available as it would be if we used
AuthenticationManagerBuilder.inMemoryAuthentication() as a
shared object in the HttpSecurity.

Fixes gh-3152
