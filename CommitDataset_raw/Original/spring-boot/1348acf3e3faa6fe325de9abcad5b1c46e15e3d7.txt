Exclude freemarker from hazelcast

Hazelcast introduced a regression in their dependency management as of
3.5 which brings freemarker. This has unfortunate side effect in a Spring
Boot application since the freemarker auto-configuration kicks in for no
apparent reason when hazelcast is used.

An exclusion has been applied until the issue is fixed in hazelcast.

Closes gh-3418
