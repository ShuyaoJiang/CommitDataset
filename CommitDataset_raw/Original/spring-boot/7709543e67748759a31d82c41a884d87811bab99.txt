Set web application context on ServletContext in plain web app tests

Previously, the web application context was only set on the
ServletContext in a full-blown integration test or when MockMvc was
used.

This commit updates SpringApplicationContextLoader so that the context
is also set on the context in a plain web application test (one where
MockMvc is not being used). The change is a partial backport of commit
7dffb702.

Closes gh-4370
