Exclude bean-validator from jersey-spring3 to avoid classpath pollution

jersey-spring3 has a transtive dependencies on HK2â€™s bean-validator
module that embeds JBoss Logging, Hibernate Validator, and Classmate
without repackaging them. This makes it impossible to control the
version of those three libraries that will be used without relying on
classpath ordering.

This commit excludes the bean-validator dependency from jersey-spring3.
The Jersey starter already depends on our Validation starter which
pulls in the proper, and controllable, version of the three
dependencies listed above so users of our starters will be unaffected.
