Remove Servlet-specific static locations

This commit removes the Servlet root context from the default values for
the `spring.resources.static-locations` configuration property. Servlet
and non-Servlet applications are sharing this property.

The Servlet root context is automatically configured as a resource
location for Spring MVC based applications.

Closes gh-9240
