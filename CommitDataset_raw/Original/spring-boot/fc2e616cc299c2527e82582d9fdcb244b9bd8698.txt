Restore Spring Boot 1.1 logging behavior

Refactor LoggingApplicationListener and LoggingSystem to restore
Spring Boot 1.1 logging behavior. The LOG_FILE and LOG_PATH system
properties are now set before configuring the logger.

The `logging.path` property is now once again optional and will not be
used when `logging.file` is specified. The documentation has also been
updated to reflect the changes.
