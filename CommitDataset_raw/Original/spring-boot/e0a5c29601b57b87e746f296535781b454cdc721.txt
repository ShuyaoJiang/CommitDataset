Add tests to verify starter dependencies when used with Gradle

We've had problems with the starters when used with Gradle. They have
been pulling in commons-logging (#987) and the wrong version of Spring
(#1028) due to Gradle's different exclusion and dependency resolution
semantics.

This commit adds some integration tests that use Gradle's tooling API
to take each starter in turn and build a Gradle project that depends
upon it. The build looks at the transitive dependencies and checks
that neither commons-logging nor any Spring modules with the wrong
version are present.

Closes #1036
