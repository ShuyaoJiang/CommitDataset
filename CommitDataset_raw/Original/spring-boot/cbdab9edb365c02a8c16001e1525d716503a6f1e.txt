Add support for custom ProtocolResolver with Devtools

Prior to this commit, custom `ProtocolResolvers` set on the
`ApplicationContext` were lost when Devtools is used as the customized
`ResourceLoader` did not copy any customization made to the default
resource loader.

This commit makes sure to copy any `ProtocolResolver` set on the context.

Closes gh-9331
