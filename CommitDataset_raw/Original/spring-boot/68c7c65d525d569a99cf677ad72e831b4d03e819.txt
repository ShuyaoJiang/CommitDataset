Configure SnakeYAML so the timestamp-like strings do not become Dates

By default, SnakeYAML will convert a timestamp-like string into a
java.util.Date. This differs to properties file-based configuration
where the values are always strings. Dates are problematic as the
round trip (string -> Date -> string) can change the value. For example,
“2015-01-27” becomes “Tue Jan 27 00:00:00 GMT 2015”.

This commit updates YamlPropertySourceLoader to use a Yaml with a
custom Resolver subclass that suppresses the addition of the implicit
resolver for timestamps. Supressing the addition of the unwanted
resolver, rather than overriding addImplicitResolvers and registering
the resolvers that we do want, ensures that we get all of the other
default Resolvers in their default order.

Fixes gh-2422
