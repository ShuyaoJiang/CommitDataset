Add support for arbitrary producer/consumer Kafka properties

PR #7672 Added support for arbitrary common properties.

However, Kafka emits a warning if a producer configuration contains
properties intended only for consumers, and vice versa.

The documentation showed a sample of how to write code to configure
arbitrary properties but this is inconvenient.

Add arbitrary properties to the consumer and procucer configs.
