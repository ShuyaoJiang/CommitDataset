Improve upgrade path for Spring Session

Commit b7e7bcf made `spring.session.store-type` explicit which means that
users of Spring Session in 1.3 have to set that property to restore the
auto-configuration support in 1.4.

This commit implicitly set the store type to redis if redis is present
and log a warning inviting the user to actually specify that in
configuration.

The entry in the auto-configuration report also mentions that such
arrangement is deprecated.

Closes gh-5838
