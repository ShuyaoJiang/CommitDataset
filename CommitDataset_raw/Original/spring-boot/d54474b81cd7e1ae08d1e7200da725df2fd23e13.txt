Allow locale to be overridden by "Accept-Language"

Previously, when `spring.mvc.locale` was specified, that locale was used
regardless of the client's preferences. This commit adds an extra
`spring.mvc.locale-resolver` property that can control how the locale is
resolved. The default is `ACCEPT_HEADER` but can be set to `FIXED` to
restore the previous behaviour.

Closes gh-6083
