Force documentation of nested group

The `strategy` group is not detected in the meta-data because the
Strategy inner class is not defined at the "right" level in the
hierarchy.

For now, `@NestedConfigurationProperty` was added to workaround the
issue. Once gh-3454 is solved, we should remove them.
