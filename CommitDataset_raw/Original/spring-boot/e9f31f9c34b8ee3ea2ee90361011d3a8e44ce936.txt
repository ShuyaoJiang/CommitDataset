Improve configuration properties back-compatibility

Refine `SystemEnvironmentPropertyMapper` to support environment
variables that would have worked in Spring Boot 1.5. Specifically,
camelCase property bindings now support an additional underscore. The
recommended way to map `fooBar` is still `PREFIX_FOOBAR`, however,
`PREFIX_FOO_BAR` will now also work.

Fixes gh-10873
