Allow beans to be used as Hibernate naming strategies

Previously, custom Hibernate naming strategies could only be
configured via properties. This allowed a fully-qualified classname to
be specified, but did not allow a naming strategy instance to be used.

This commit updates HibernateJpaConfiguration to use
ImplicitNamingStrategy and PhysicalNamingStrategy beans if they
exist. If both a bean exists and the equivalent property has been set,
the bean wins.
