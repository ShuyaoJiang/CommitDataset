[bs-138] Make it easy to secure only the management endpoints

Example: web UI with publicly available static assets

    # application.properties:
    security.ignored: /css/**,/script/**

Example: web UI with publicly available everything, but secure
management endpoints.

    # application.properties:
    # Empty path for basic security (default is /**)
    security.basic.path=

[Fixes #50721675]
