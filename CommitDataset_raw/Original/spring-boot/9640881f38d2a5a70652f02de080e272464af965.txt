Fix BuildInfo up-to-date check when group, name, or version changes

Previously, if the project's group, name, or version changed the
BuildInfo task would still be considered up-to-date as the values of
the project's properties were not reflected in the fields of the
BuildInfo instance.

This commit updates BuildInfo to copy the value of the project's
property to the corresponding BuildInfo field when the property is
read using its getter method on BuildInfo.

Closes gh-12266
