Gracefully disable Solr auto-configuration when Solr 5 is on classpath

Previously, if Solr 5 was on the classpath, SolrAutoConfiguration
would fail with a rather cryptic error message due to a change in the
inheritance hierarchy of CloudSolrServer between Solr 4 and Solr 5.

This commit updates SolrAutoConfiguration to be conditional on a
class that exists in Solr 4 but was removed in Solr 5. This has the
effect of switching off the auto-configuration when Solr 5 is on
the classpath, allowing the auto-configuration report to be used to
identify why the configuration was disabled. The documentation has
also been updated to state that Spring Boot does not currently support
Solr 5.0.
