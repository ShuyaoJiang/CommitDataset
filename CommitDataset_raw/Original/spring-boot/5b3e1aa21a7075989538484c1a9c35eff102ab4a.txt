Optimize ConfigurationPropertyName

This commit changes the iteration order when checking for element
equality. This is based on the educated guess that child elements
will likely differ while parents will probably be the same.

E.g. comparing "spring.banner.charset" with "spring.banner.location"
will now first check "charset" against "location" and thus saves some
cycles for elements that will be the same.
