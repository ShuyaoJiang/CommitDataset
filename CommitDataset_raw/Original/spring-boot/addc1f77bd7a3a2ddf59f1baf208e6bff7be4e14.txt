Support transitive excludes in dependency-tools

Update spring-boot-dependency-tools to support transitive excludes.
Transitive excludes are useful with Gradle which considers each
dependency independently (see GRADLE-3061).

Transitive excludes are supported by parsing the dependency-tree file
from spring-boot-versions.

See gh-1047
