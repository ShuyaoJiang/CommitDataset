Log all configured connectors when Tomcat is initialized

Previously, Tomcat initialization would only log the port of the
primary connector and would omit the scheme, whereas once Tomcat was
started the port of every connector and their schemes would be logged.

This commit makes things symmetrical by updating the logging performed
at initialization to include every connector's port and scheme.

During initialization the port number that the connector the has
been configured with is logged. This means that, if the connector has
been configured to bind to an free port, 0 will be logged. Once
Tomcat has started, the number of the port that the connector has
bound to is logged.

Closes gh-1601
