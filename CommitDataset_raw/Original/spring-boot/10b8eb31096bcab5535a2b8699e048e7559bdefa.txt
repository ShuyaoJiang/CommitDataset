Split ConfigurationPropertySource for iteration

Create separate `IterableConfigurationPropertySource` and
`ConfigurationPropertySource` interfaces so that it's possible to
work out if a source can truly iterate the values that it contains.

Prior to this commit there was only a single
`ConfigurationPropertySource` interface, which returned an empty
Iterator when values could not be iterated. This design made it
impossible to tell the difference between a source that was empty, and
a source that could not be iterated.

The `ConfigurationPropertySources` class has been updated to adapt
non-enumerable and enumerable Spring PropertySources to the correct
`ConfigurationPropertySource` interface. It also deals with the edge
case of the `SystemPropertySource` running in a security restricted
environment.

Fixes gh-9057
