Reinstate auto-config of RequestContextFilter with Jersey

Previously, the auto-configuration for both Jersey and WebMvc would auto-configure
a RequestContextFilter bean. In 2.1.0, this led to a startup failure due to the latter
attempting to override the bean defined by the former. In addition to the override there
were also problems with the order of the filter as Jersey uses -1 and MVC uses -105.

To avoid the above-described problems, the auto-configuration of the RequestContextFilter
was removed from JerseyAutoConfiguration in 2.1.1. Unfortunately, the broke
request-scoped beans for those using only Jersey.

This commit attempts to strike a better balance by reintroducing the auto-configuration
of RequestContextFilter in JerseyAutoConfiguration. It will back off if the user defines
their own filter or filter registration. WebMvcAutoConfiguration has been updated to
back off in the same manner. This leaves the potential for ordering problems, but they
are no worse than they were before. Furthermore, the user has the means to correct any
problems by using the various filter ordering properties that are provided for Jersey,
Spring Session, Spring Security, etc.
