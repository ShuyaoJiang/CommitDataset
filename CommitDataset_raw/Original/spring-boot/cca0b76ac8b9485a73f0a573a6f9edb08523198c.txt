Support Velocity toolbox configurations from jar

Create an EmbeddedVelocityToolboxView which supports loading toolbox.xml
files from the application classpath as well as the ServletContext. The
VelocityAutoConfiguration class has been updated to use the new view.

This change allows the `spring.velocity.toolbox-config-location`
property to work with embedded servlet containers.

Fixes gh-2912
