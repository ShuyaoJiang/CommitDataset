Add easy way to consume configuration metadata

Add a companion module that IDE developers can use to read configuration
metadata from multiple sources into a single repository.

ConfigurationMetadataRepository provides access to groups and items as
well as an harmonized view on "sources" (that is the POJOs that have
contributed to a given group).

Closes gh-1970
