Fix `QuartzAutoConfigurtion` failure with multiple `Executor` beans

`QuartzAutoConfigurtion` currently blows up if there are multiple
`Executor` beans in the context.

This commit changes the configuration to retrieve `Executor` bean using
`ObjectProvider#getIfUnique` which won't fail in scenarios where there
are multiple `Executor` beans with none marked as `@Primary`.

Closes gh-9434
