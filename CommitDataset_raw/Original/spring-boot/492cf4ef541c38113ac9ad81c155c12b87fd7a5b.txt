Add jersey-bean-validation to spring-boot-starter-jersey

A dependency on org.glassfish.jersey.ext:jersey-bean-validation has
been added to spring-boot-starter-jersey. jersey-bean-validationâ€™s EL
dependencies have been excluded in favour of those provided by
spring-boot-starter-tomcat (or starter-jetty or starter-undertow should
the user choose to use a different embedded container).
