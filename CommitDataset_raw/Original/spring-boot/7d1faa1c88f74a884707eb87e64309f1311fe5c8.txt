Ignore static and abstract accessors

This commit updates the annotation processor and the binder to ignore
any static or abstract method that has the characteristics of a JavaBean
accessor. As a result, no property is generated for those (invalid)
accessor and no binding occurs on them either.

Closes gh-12390
