Disable suffix pattern matching in Spring MVC

This commit disables by default suffix pattern matching in Spring MVC
applications. As described in the Spring MVC documentation (see
https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web.html#mvc-ann-requestmapping-suffix-pattern-match),
this is considered as best practice.

This change also introduces new configuration properties to achieve
similar results in a safer way (using query parameters) or to rollback
to the former default.

Closes gh-11105
