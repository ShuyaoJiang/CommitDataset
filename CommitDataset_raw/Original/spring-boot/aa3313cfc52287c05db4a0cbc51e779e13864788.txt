Update NamePatternFilter to detect regular expression character class

Previously, NamePatternFilter looked for “*”, “$”, “^”, or “+” when
trying to identify a string as being a regular expression. This meant
that it missed the use of a character class ([a-z], for example). This
commit adds “[“} to the list of characters that are considered to be
part of a regular expression.
