Make sure Caching is initialized before JPA support

The second level cache of Hibernate can be configured with dedicated
factories that look up for the presence of a cache infrastructure. As
Hibernate shouldn't have to know about Spring, that lookup is done
against the respective proprietary APIs.

We now make sure that caching (and the general purpose Hazelcast
auto-configuration) is fully processed before JPA kicks in. In particular
an explicit `dependsOn` attribute on those beans is added when they are
processed.
