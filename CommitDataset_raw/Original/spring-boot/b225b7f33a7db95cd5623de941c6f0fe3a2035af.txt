Rename EnableAutoConfigurationImportSelector

Rename EnableAutoConfigurationImportSelector to the more general
AutoConfigurationImportSelector since it's now used for more than
just the enable annotation.

The existing EnableAutoConfigurationImportSelector class remains in
a deprecated form so that it can be made package-private again in
Spring Boot 2.0.

Fixes gh-8072
