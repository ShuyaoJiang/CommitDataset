Add instanceof check and nice fat error message

If Logback and another SLF4J implementation are both on the classpath
it is possible for the LogbackLoggingSystem to fail to locate
a LoggerContext. Rather than a ClassCastException it is better to
make an assertion with an error message.

Fixes gh-162
