Support SpringApplicationBuilder with bound sources

Update `SpringApplicationBuilder` so that the `sources(...)` method
updates the primary sources. Prior to this commit, the fix for #8910
had the unfortunate side effect of stopping the
`SpringApplicationBuilder` from being used with
`spring.application.main` properties.

Fixes gh-9053
