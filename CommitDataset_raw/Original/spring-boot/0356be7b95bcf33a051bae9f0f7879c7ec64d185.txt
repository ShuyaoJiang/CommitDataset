Refine AliasFor usage

This commit makes sure to use `getAliasedStringArray` rather than
`getStringArray` as the latter does not work with ASM. While this will
probably be fixed in the core framework, this commit also adds dedicated
tests with ASM to ensure that the code works as expected.

Closes gh-6337
