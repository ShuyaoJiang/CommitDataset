Add email support

This commit adds a new starter to auto-configure a MailSender when the
necessary classes are present and when the property "spring.mail.host" is
set.

The auto-configuration also accepts any arbitrary properties that
JavaMail might need using the "spring.mail.properties" prefix.

Fixes gh-1760
