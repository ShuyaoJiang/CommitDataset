Align expectations with Spring Data REST’s new behaviour in Fowler

The response produced by Spring Data REST to a search that will always
return a single result, i.e. the return type is Foo rather than
List<Foo> or Page<Foo> has improved in Fowler. Previously, the response
would contain a single embedded resource. In Fowler, the response now
contains the resource that used to be embedded as a top-level resource.
This commit updates the expectations in one of the sample’s tests to
match this new behaviour.
