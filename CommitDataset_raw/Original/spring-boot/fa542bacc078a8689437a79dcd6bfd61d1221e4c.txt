Translate user-defined exception when invoking JMX operation

This commit makes sure to respect the MBeanServer#invoke contract by
wrapping any user-defined exception in an MBeanException. Also, any
exception not from the JDK is translated, as it may lead to unexpected
issue on the client if that class isn't present. This is consistent
with our operation result mapping strategy.

Closes gh-10448
