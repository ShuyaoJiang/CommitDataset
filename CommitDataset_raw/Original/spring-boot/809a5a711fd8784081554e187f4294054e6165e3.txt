Add a @EnableWebSecurity if it looks like the user needs one

If the user explicitly disables the basic security features and forgets to
@EnableWebSecurity, and yet still wants a bean of type
WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter, he is trying to use a custom
security setup and the app would fail in a confusing way without
this change.

Fixes gh-568
