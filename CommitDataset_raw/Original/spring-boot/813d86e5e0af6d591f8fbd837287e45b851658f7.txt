Auto-configure Rabbit MessageConverter

If a `MessageConverter` bean is available, we now associate it to the
created `RabbitTemplate` and `RabbitListenerContainerFactory`. That way,
registering a custom `MessageConverter` is all that's needed.

The Rabbit auto-configuration is now using the new `ObjectProvider` that
offers a nicer API to detect if a primary candidate is available for
optional collaborators.

Closes gh-5088
