Add CacheControl config keys in spring.resources.*

This commit adds several configuration keys for customizing the
"Cache-Control" HTTP response header when serving static resources.

New keys are located in the "spring.resources.cache-control.*"
namespace; anything configured there will prevail on existing
"spring.resources.cache-period=" values, so as to mirror Spring MVC's
behavior.

Fixes gh-9432
