Auto-configure WebClient.Builder

This commit adds a new customizer interface for applying
configuration changes to `WebClient.Builder` beans:
`WebClientCustomizer`.

The new WebClient auto-configuration will make available, as a
prototype scoped bean, `WebClient.Builder` instances.
Once injected, developers can use those to create `WebClient`
instances to be used in their application.

`WebClientCustomizer` beans are sorted according to their
`Order` and then applied to the builder instances.

Closes gh-9522
