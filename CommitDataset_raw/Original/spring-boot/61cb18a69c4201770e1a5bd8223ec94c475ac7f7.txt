Use JOOQ's Spring DB name during exception translation

The name of a JOOQ SQLDialect does not always match the name defined
in sql-error-codes.xml. For example, the Postgres translator was not
initialized correctly because in JOOQ the dialect is named
SQLDialect.POSTGRES, but in sql-error-codes.xml the bean is named
"PostgreSQL".

This commit updates the translator to use the dialects third-party
springDbName which ensures that it maps correctly to the entries in
sql-error-codes.xml.

Closes gh-5884
