Refactor PropertySource support

Locate PropertySourcesLoaders using SpringFactoriesLoader and refactor
the interface to expose file extensions and support 'profiles' within
documents.

Rework ConfigFileApplicationListener for consistent profile loading.
Profiles are now loaded in a consistent order for both profile specific
files, and contained profile documents (i.e. YAML sub-sections).

Also update ConfigFileApplicationListener so that it no longer directly
processes @ProperySource annotations. Instead the standard Spring
ConfigurationClassPostProcessor will insert @PropertySource items with
ConfigFileApplicationListener later re-ordering them.

The SpringApplication can no longer be configured using @ProperySource
annotations, however, application.properties may still be used.

Fixes gh-322
