Polish new tests for the Gradle plugin's deprecated ID

The output capture for the deprecation warning only appears to work
when the test is run in isolation. I can't figure out why that's the
case, particularly as we have another test class
(BootRunResourceTests) that uses OutputCapture and works reliably.

I'm cutting my loses and removing the use of OutputCapture and the
assertion that the warnings is logged.
