Support embedded jar initialization scripts

Update the Maven and Gradle plugin to generate fully executable jar
files on Unix like machines. A launcher bash script is added to the
front of the jar file which handles execution.

The default execution script will either launch the application or
handle init.d service operations (start/stop/restart) depending on if
the application is executed directly, or via a symlink to init.d.
