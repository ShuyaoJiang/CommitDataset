Auto-detect fork value in stop goal

So far, one has to set the "fork" value to both the start and stop
goals. Since they have the same name, sharing them in a global
configuration element does the trick. However, the plugin also supports
auto-detection of the fork value according to other parameters:
typically if an agent or jvm arguments are set, forking will be
automatically enabled. This is a problem since the stop goal is not aware
of that.

This commit transmits the value in a property attached to the
`MavenProject`. That way, the stop goal can retrieve that value and
apply the same defaults. This has the side effect that specifying the
fork value isn't necessary anymore.

Closes gh-6747
