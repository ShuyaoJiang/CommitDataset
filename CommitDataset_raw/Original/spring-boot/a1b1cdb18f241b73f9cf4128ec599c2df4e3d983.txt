Improve resource handling in LogFileMvcEndpoint

Update `LogFileMvcEndpoint` to use a `ResourceHttpRequestHandler` when
serving the log file resource. This gives support for requesting parts
of the logfile via the HTTP Range header. Requests with the
`If-Modified-Since` header are now also handled correctly.

Closes gh-4333
