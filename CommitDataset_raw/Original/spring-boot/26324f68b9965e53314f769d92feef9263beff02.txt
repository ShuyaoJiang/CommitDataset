Make system props available when building model for CLI dep mgmt bom

Certain Maven profile activator’s require access to System properties
to determine whether or not a profile should be activated.
JdkVersionProfileActivator is one such activator.

Prior to this commit, the presence of a Maven profile that was activated
based on the JDK in a bom imported using @DependencyManagementBom in the
CLI would trigger a failure as the JdkVersionProfileActivator could not
determine the version of Java on which it was running.

This commit updates the CLI to pass the JVM’s System properties to the
request to build a bom’s model so that those system properties can be
used by JdkVersionProfileActivator (and any other activators which need
them).
