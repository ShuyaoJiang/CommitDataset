[bs-98] Add support for Tomcat database pool

* If Tomcat jdbc is available and the driverClassName and url
are provided or can be guessed (e.g. for HSQL) it is used.
Properties spring.database.{driverClassName,url} are consulted.

* If Commons DBCP is available it is used (if Tomcat is not)

* Otherwise an EmbeddedDatabase is created if all the bits are
available

* A JdbcOperations and a NamedParameterJdbcOperations are
available by default if a DataSource is created

* The data source is initialized from spring.database.schema (csv
of resource patterns)

[Fixes #49393511]
