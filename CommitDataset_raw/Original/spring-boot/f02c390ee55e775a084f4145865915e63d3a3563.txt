Simplify commons-logging exclusions and remove redundant dep mgmnt

c719ab7a adding dependency management for a number of Apache Commons
projects to exclude commons-logging and resolve problems with
dependency convergence.

As Boot's dependencies have evolved, much of this dependency
management has become redundant. This commit removes it, and excludes
commons-logging in the single starter that still needs it instead.

Closes gh-7050
