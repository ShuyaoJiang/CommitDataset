Remove error-level metadata for Spring Mobile

While Spring Mobile support has been removed from Spring Boot, the
auto-configuration has been relocated to a separate module that uses
the same keys.

Flagging those keys as deprecated means that the IDE will be confused
when the extra jar is present on the classpath as it advertizes, as
it should, support fo them.

Closes gh-11844
