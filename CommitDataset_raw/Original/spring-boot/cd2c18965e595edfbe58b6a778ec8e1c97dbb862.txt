Support javaagent instrumentation with loader

Update spring-boot-loader to allow `-javaagent` instrumentation when
running from executable jars.

Prior to this commit the `Launcher` skipped the application classloader
and instead used the system classloader as a parent. This was to ensure
that locally packaged classes were always loaded by the classloader
that had access to nested jars.  Unfortunately when using the
`-javaagent` option, it is the application classloader that is modified.

The `Launcher` class now uses the application classloader as parent
and `LaunchedURLClassLoader` has been updated to always search local
URLs before delegating to the parent. This is very similar to the way
that most application servers handle the loading of war files.
