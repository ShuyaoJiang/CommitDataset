Fix spring.profiles.default with profile enabled by configuration file

Previously, if the user configured a custom default profile and then
enabled another profile using a configuration file, the custom default
profile would be activated when it should not have been.

This commit updates ConfigFileApplicationListener so that when a
profile is activated via a configuration file, any profiles
that are queued purely because they are a default profile are removed
from the queue. This ensures that a default profile is not active
when another profile is activated via a configuration file.

Closes gh-5998
