Enable fork more when devtools is present

This commit improves the run goal to automatically fork the process when
devtools is present and log a warning when fork has been disabled via
configuration since devtools will not work on a non-forked process.

We don't want devtools to kick in for integration tests so the logic has
been placed in `RunMojo` requiring a couple of protected methods to
override.

Closes gh-5137
