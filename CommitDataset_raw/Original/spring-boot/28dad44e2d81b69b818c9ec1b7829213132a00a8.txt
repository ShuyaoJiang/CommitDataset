Be defensive about JUL calls from JAR Handler

Update nested JAR support to only obtain JUL loggers when absolutely
necessary and to defensively deal with failures.

Prior to this commit it was not possible to override
`java.util.logging.manager` to use a nested JAR as the logger
implementation.

Fixes gh-9848
