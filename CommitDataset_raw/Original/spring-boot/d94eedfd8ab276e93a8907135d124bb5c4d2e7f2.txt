Exclude `META-INF/build-info.properties` from restart

Prior to this commit any application configured to write
`META-INF/build-info.properties` could trigger unexpected application
restarts. The problem is particularly prevalent when using Eclipse M2E in
combination with Maven's `spring-boot-maven-plugin` `build-info` goal
and Gradle's `springBoot` `buildInfo()`.

Closes gh-7002
