Auto-Configure FormContentFilter in Spring MVC

Because `HttpPutFormContentFilter` has been deprecated in Spring
Framework 5.1, this commit updates the auto-configuration to replace it
with the new `FormContentFilter`. This new filter is building on the
previous one and supports HTTP DELETE requests as well.

Both filters should not be used in addition, so the former
configuration has been removed. This commit also adds configuration
metadata to let developers know about the configuration key change.
