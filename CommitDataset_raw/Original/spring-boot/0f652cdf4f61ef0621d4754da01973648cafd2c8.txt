Fix injection point with proxied DataSource

Prior to this commit, the `ApplicationContext` couldn't start with a
JDK-proxied `HikariDataSource` as the JMX auto-configuration was
attempting to inject a (too narrowed) `HikariDataSource`.

This commit rather injects a regular `DataSource` and attempt to unwrap
it as a `HikariDataSource`.

Closes gh-12271
