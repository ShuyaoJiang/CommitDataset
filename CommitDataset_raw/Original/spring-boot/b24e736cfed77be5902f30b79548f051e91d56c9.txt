Add env var parameters to launch.script

Some of the features of the launch.script were not exposed for users
to be able to control at runtime. It now accepts things like
PID_FOLDER and LOG_FOLDER as environment variables, and also adopts
a clear naming convention where only the inputs are UPPER_CASE.
