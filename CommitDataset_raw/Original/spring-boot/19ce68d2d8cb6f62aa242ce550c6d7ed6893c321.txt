Prefix endpoint's path to controller endpoint mappings with no path

Previously, if a controll endpoint included a mapping with no path,
it would be mapped to the root of the application rather than the
root of the endpoint's path.

This commit updates the handler mappings for both reactive and Servlet
web applications to treat a mapping with no paths as being a mapping
with a single empty path. This ensures that a path with the endpoint's
path prepended is used for the mapping.

Closes gh-12104
