Add dependency management for more Selenium modules

Previously, we only had dependency management for
selenium-htmlunit-driver. It depends on three other Selenium modules
for which dependency management was not provided. This means that there
was a risk that a mixture of versions would end up on the classpath.

This commit adds dependency management for the Selenium modules upon
which selenium-htmlunit-driver depends.

Closes gh-5520
