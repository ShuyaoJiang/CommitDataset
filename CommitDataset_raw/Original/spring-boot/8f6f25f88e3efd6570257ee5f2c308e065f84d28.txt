Improve property target name

Previously, non camel case properties were wrongly resolved, i.e.
getFOO() leading to a 'f-o-o'. While unusual, underscores can also be
added to a property name. In that case, the hyphen should not be added
as the binder consider this to be a single "word". Typically setFoo_Bar
on the "something" prefix is mapped using "something.foo_bar".

All these cases are now handled properly, generating the target name that
the binder expects.

Fixes gh-2118
