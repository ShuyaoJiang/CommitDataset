Fix social property binding

Update Spring Social auto-configurations to read properties using
the `dashed` notation and with the appropriate prefixes. This allows
properties to be specified in any of the relaxed forms.

Also minor refactor to extract common logic to a new
SocialAutoConfigurerAdapter base class.
