Allow spring.profiles.include to be used anywhere to add active profiles

Previously, spring.profiles.include was only considered when it was
used in a configuration file. It was ignored in any other property
source.

This commit updates ConfigFileApplicationListener so that
spring.profiles.include can be used in any property source to add to
the profiles that have been declared active via
spring.profiles.active.

Closes gh-7668
