Use empty key-store-password if storeprovider present

For tomcat, if an SslStoreProvider is configured,
`SslStoreProviderUrlStreamHandlerFactory` stores the keyStore with an
empty password. Previously, if a password was supplied using the
ssl.key-store-password property, that would be the password used to
load the keystore and the connector would fail with a
"Password verification failed" exception.
