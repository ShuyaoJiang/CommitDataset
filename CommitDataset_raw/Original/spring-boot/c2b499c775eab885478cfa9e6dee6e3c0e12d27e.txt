Support for @Beans of type HttpMessageConverter, and Jackson specific details

You can contribute additional HttpMessageConverters
by simply adding beans of that type in a Spring Boot
context. If a bean you add is of a type that would have been included
by default anyway (like MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter for JSON
conversions) then it will replace the default value. A convenience
bean is provided of type MessageConverters (always available if you
use the default MVC configuration) which has some useful methods to
access the default and user-enhanced message converters (useful, for
example if you want to manually inject them into a custom
RestTemplate).

There are also some convenient configuration shortcuts for Jackson2.
The smallest change that might work is to just add beans of type
Module to your context. They will be registered with the default
ObjectMapper and then injected into the default message
converter. In addition, if your context contains any beans of type
ObjectMapper then all of the Module beans will be registered with
all of the mappers.
