Write management and main server access logs to separate files

Previously, when access logging was enabled and the management server
was running on a separate port, both the main server and the management
server would write their access logs to the same file. Having two
separate containers writing to the same file could cause problems such
as causing log rotation to break.

This commit updates the actuator so that when the management server is
running on a separate port (and therefore using a separate container)
it prepends management_ to the access log prefix so that the main
server and the management server write their access logs to separate
files in the same directory.
