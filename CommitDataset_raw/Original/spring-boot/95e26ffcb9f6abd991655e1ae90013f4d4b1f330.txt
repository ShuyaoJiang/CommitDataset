Avoid uri tag explosion when use of path variable is undetected

This commit aligns the Spring WebFlux instrumentation on Spring MVC
since gh-12447.
From now on, if the best matching path pattern is not found,
the recorded uri tag will be "UNKNOWN".

Note that for WebFlux.fn, the pattern information is properly
recorded as of SPR-17395.

Closes gh-15609
