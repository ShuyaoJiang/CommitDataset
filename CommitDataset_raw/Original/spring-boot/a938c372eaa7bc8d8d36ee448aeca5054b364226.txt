Switch to async promotion

Due to timeouts while distributing release artifacts,
this commit uses the async mode for distribution.

Before syncing to maven central, we need to check if all the artifacts
have been published to Bintray. This is done by hitting the Bintray API
till we get the version or until a timeout is reached.

Closes gh-12292
