Consistently apply exclude on auto-configuration

Previously, exclude of an import selector was applied only locally. In
other words, if one import selector imports `AcmeAutoConfiguration` and
another one exclude it, it would still be imported because exclude were
applied separately

This commit collects the outcome of all auto-configuration import
selectors and then apply exclusions in a single pass.

Closes gh-12586
