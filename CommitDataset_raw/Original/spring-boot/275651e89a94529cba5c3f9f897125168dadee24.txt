Skips Cassandra and Elasticsearch tests on Windows

Neither Cassandra nor Elasticsearch starts reliably on Windows. This
commit adds a custom class rule to the associated sample application
tests to skip them on Windows. A class rule is used rather than a
Unit assumption as we want to avoid starting Elasticsearch (done by
the application context) and Cassandra (done by a test execution
listener) and an assumption would be too late.
