Reduce PropertySource access when binding

Update `PropertiesConfigurationFactory` so that when possible fewer
calls are made to the underlying `PropertySource`. The
`PropertySourcesPropertyValues` class now accepts a matcher which is
used to limit the properties that should be adapted. The factory will
create a matcher based on the standard relaxed binding rules.
