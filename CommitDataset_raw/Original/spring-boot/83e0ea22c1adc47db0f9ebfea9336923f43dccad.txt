[bs-19] Add samples and CLI support for Spring Integration

    $ cd spring-bootstrap-cli
    $ export SPRING_HOME=target
    $ src/main/scripts/spring run samples/integration.groovy

The big disadvantage at the moment is that there is no goo way to
detect Spring Integration in the AST (at least not as good as @Enable*).
So for now we are looking for @MessageEndpoint or a class name with
SpringIntegration in it.
