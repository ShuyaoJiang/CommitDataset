Auto-generate tables describing the first-party starters

Previously, the documentation included hand-written tables for the
application, production, and technical starters.

This commit replaces the hand-written tables with tables that are
generated automatically from all of the starter poms, thereby ensuring
that the documentation is automatically kept up-to-date as starters
are added and removed. An extra column provided a link to each
starter's pom on GitHub has also been added to the table. This makes
it easier for users to see exactly what each starter contains.

Closes gh-5267
