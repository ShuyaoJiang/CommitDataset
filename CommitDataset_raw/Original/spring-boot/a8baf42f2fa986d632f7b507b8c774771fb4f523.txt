Ensure that CharacterEncodingFilter is ordered first

This commit makes sure that `CharacterEncodingFilter` is ordered with
the `Ordered.HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE` and that other filters, potentially
reading the request body, are ordered after.

In this particular case, both `WebMvcMetricsFilter` and
`ErrorPageFilter` are now ordered at `Ordered.HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE + 1` to
avoid cases where the request body is read before the encoding
configuration is taken into account.

Closes gh-11607
