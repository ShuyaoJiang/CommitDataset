Disable unnecessary database initialization

If a DataSource class is found in the classpath then
EmbeddedDataSourceConfiguration will not be used, so the in-memory
database will not be shutdown on application context closing.
As a result, unnecessary database initialization may cause subsequent
tests to fail, for example see [1].
