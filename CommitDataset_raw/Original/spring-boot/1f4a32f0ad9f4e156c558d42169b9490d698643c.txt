Add a way to signal that an endpoint request is invalid

This commit adds InvalidEndpointRequestException as a technology
agnostic way to signal that an endpoint request is invalid. When such
exception is thrown, the web layer translates that to a 400.

Rather than overriding the reason, this commit makes sure to reuse the
error infrastructure.

Closes gh-10618
