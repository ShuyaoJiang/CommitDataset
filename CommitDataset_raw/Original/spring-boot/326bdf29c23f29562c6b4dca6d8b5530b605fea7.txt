Remove unused configuration map

Remove the configuration map defined in `GroovyTemplateProperties` which
isn't used. Ironically, that configuration map was exposed with the exact
same prefix as `GroovyMarkupConfigurer`, which broke IDEs support since
two entries had the exact same prefix.

Fixes gh-2840
