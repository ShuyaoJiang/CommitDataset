Don't user root path for HAL endpoints

Update LinksMvcEndpoint and HalBrowserMvcEndpoint so that no longer try
to use the `/` context path. Links are now available from `/links` and
the HAL browser is available from `/hal`.

The actuator HAL browser now works with either WebJars or the Spring
Data version. It also now transforms the initial HTML so that the
form is pre-populated with `/links`.

When using Spring Data's HAL browser, the root includes a link to
`/links` with a rel of `actuator`.
