Add custom Eclipse code formatter

Update Eclipse settings to make use of a custom Spring formatter
implementation. Using a custom formatter allows us to fix a couple of

The custom formatter also means that it is possible to use Groovy
Eclipse despite the fact that it has formatter regressions (see
https://github.com/groovy/groovy-eclipse/issues/142).

Fixes gh-4136
