Fix RedisRepositoriesAutoConfiguration condition

Rather than checking if Jedis is on the classpath, this commit changes
the conditions of `RedisRepositoriesAutoConfiguration` to check for the
presence of a `RedisConnectionFactory` bean that is going to be
necessary to create the Redis repositories anyway.

Checking for Jedis is no longer correct since we now support Lettuce as
well.

Closes gh-9523
