Support Jackson based XML serialization and Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder

This commit introduces support for Jackson based XML serialization, using the
new MappingJackson2XmlHttpMessageConverter provided by Spring Framework
4.1. It is automatically activated when Jackson XML extension is detected on the
classpath.

Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder is now used to create ObjectMapper and XmlMapper
instances with the following customized properties:
 - MapperFeature.DEFAULT_VIEW_INCLUSION is disabled
 - DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES is disabled

JodaModuleAutoConfiguration and Jsr310ModuleAutoConfiguration have been removed
since their behaviors are now handled directly by the ObjectMapper builder.

In addition to the existing @Bean of type ObjectMapper support, it is now
possible to customize Jackson based serialization properties by declaring
a @Bean of type Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder.
