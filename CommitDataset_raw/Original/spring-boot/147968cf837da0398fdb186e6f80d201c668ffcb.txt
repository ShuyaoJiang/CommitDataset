Set isolation to DEFAULT for JPA transaction manager

Also logs a warning about the fact that locks may not be taken when
starting a Job. JPA and Batch don't really work that well together
in general so it's probably not worth a lot of effort to work aoround
this. If anyone needs to they should create a custom JpaDialect
(and a BatchConfigurer).

Fixes gh-197
