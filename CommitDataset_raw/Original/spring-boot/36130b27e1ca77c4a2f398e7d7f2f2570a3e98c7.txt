Support for Jmx (and Integration) autoconfig in parent contexts

When there are parent contexts we already had a strategy for registering
the actuator endpoints, but not the regular JMX or Integration MBeans.
This chnage makes the autoconfigs for JMX aware of the parent context.

Also adds a sample with a parent context.
