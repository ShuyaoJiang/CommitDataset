Support for setting credentials and vhost in rabbit addresses

User can now add credentials, vhost and protocol prefix (amqp://)
to any or all of the addresses, extending the format beyond that accepted
bu the rabbitmq client, but making it cloud friendly. Only one of
the addresses needs those properties and all are optional. Port
also defaults to 5672 in an address.
