Ignore URI when local.mongo.port is set

This commit makes sure that if `local.mongo.port` is set, a `MongoClient`
on the embedded MongoDB instance is created. When an embedded instance
is detected, only the `host` property is used and the `uri` is ignored if
set.

This makes sure that the auto-configured `MongoClient` automatically
switches to the embedded server, even if a production uri has been
specified.

Closes gh-8219
