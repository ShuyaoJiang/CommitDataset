Consider mvn spring-boot:run that exits with 130 (SIGINT) to be successful

Previously, if mvn spring-boot:run with a forked JVM was killed with 
CTRL+C, the run would be considered unsuccessful. This commits updates
the run mojo to consider a forked JVM that exists with 130 (the exit
code produced when exiting due to SIGINT which is what CTRL+C sends) to
be successful.
