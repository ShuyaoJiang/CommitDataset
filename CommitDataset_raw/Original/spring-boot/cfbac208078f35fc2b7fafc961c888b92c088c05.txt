Ensure ErrorControllers work when using AOP

Add a BeanFactoryPostProcessor to set PRESERVE_TARGET_CLASS_ATTRIBUTE
to true on all ErrorController bean definitions. Without this attribute
AOP advice on @Controllers causes ErrorController beans to be created
as JDK proxies (since they implement a single valid looking interface)
and therefore not get found by Spring MVC.

Fixes gh-4236
