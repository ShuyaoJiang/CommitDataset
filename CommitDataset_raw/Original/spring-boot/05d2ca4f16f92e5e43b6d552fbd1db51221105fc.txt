Allow bean binding if property binding fails

Update `Binder` so that if a property exists, but it cannot be converted
to required type, bean binding is attempted.

Prior to this commit, if a user happened to have an environment
variable named `SERVER` the binder would fail when trying to directly
convert its `String` value into a `ServerProperties`

Fixes gh-10945
