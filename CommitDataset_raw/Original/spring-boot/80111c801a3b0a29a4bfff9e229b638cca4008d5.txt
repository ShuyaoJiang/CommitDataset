Consider custom authentication database when creating MongoClient

Previously, MongoProperties did not consider the configuration of a
custom authentication database when creating a MongoClient. This
commit updates MongoProperties to use the authentication database
when it is configured, falling back to the normal database when it is
not configured.

Closes gh-2562
