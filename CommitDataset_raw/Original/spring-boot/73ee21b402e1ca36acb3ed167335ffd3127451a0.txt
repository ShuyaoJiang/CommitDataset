Provide dependency management for JBoss Logging

Several libraries that Spring Boot supports depend on JBoss Logging but
they use a variety of versions. This means that the actual version of
JBoss Logging that will be used depends on your build system. Gradle
will pick the latest version that’s in the dependency graph, Maven
will pick the version that’s nearest the root of the graph and, if two
dependencies are equidistant, it’ll pick the version that’s pulled in
by the dependency listed first in the pom. In short, it’s very hard to
reason about the version of JBoss Logging that you’ll actually use at
runtime.

This commit adds dependency management for JBoss Logging so that a
consistent version is used, irrespective of your build system or
dependencies.

Closes gh-4185
