Disable resource chain cache when DevTools is enabled

If the resource chain is used, such as by using the
`"spring.resources.chain.strategy.content.enabled"` property,
resource chain caching can prevent the developer from seeing
changes made to resources, so that caching should be disabled
when DevTools is enabled.

This commit sets the `"spring.resources.chain.cache"` property
to `true` when devtools is enabled.
