Ordering of Application Initializer and Listeners

Update javadoc and method names to indicate that ApplicationInitializer
and ApplicationListeners are `Order` sorted before being invoked.

Also remove specific sorting from SpringApplicationBuilder, relying
instead on the Order sorting.

Fixes gh-316
