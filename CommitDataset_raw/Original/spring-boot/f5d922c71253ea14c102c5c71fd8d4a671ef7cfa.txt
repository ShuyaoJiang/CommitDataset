Upgrade to Spring Integration 5.1.0.M2

Upgrade to M2 broke a test that was looking for a particular bean that
is configured by Spring Integration (`HeaderChannelRegistry`).

It looks like INT-4517 is related to the regression as it registers the
bean too late for the auto-configuration to see it.

This commit changes the condition to a more central bean that is created
very early on.

Closes gh-14142
