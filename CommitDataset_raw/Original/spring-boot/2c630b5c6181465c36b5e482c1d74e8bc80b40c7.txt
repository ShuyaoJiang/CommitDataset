Validate schema and data resources

Previously, if a user specifies a path to a schema or data DDL that does
not exist, the application will start up fine and the missing DDL would
not be reported.

This commit validates that user-defined resources actually exist and
throw a new `ResourceNotFoundException` if they don't.

Closes gh-7088
