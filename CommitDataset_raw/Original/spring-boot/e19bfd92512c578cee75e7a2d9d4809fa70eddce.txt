Document how to use Tomcat 7 or Jetty 8 with Gradle

Previously, the documentation only provided examples of the required
configuration for Maven users. This commit adds equivalent configuration
snippets for those using Gradle. It also removes the recommendation to
override the version of the Servlet API as this is unnecessary. The pom
files for the Jetty 8 and Tomcat 7 samples have also been updated
accordingly.

Closes gh-2346
