Make it easier to override CONSOLE_LOG_PATTERN when including base.xml

Previously, the CONSOLE_LOG_PATTERN property would always be set as
a result of base.xml including defaults.xml. This made it hard to
override the CONSOLE_LOG_PATTERN as it required a copy and paste of
the configuration.

This commit updates defaults.xml so that CONSOLE_LOG_PATTERN is only
set if it has not already been set. This reduces the configuration to
customize the console log pattern to a handful of lines.
