Improve WebFlux error logging

This commit avoids printing the stacktrace for ResponseStatusException
in order to be consistent with WebFlux ResponseStatusExceptionHandler
and because this stacktrace is usually not very useful in Reactive
world and mainly pollutes the logs, only the message is logged in that
case.

It also logs a WARN message for Bad Request (400) HTTP responses in
order to have a feedback when an exception is thrown due to client error
(unable to deserialize request body for example).
