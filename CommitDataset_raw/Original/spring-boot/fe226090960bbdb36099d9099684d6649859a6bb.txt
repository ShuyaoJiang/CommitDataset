Test that temp file has been deleted before triggering heap dump

The MBean requires that a file does not exist at the location to which
it’s dumping the heap. This commit updates the test to ensure that the
temporary file that’s created to get a location for the heap dump file
is deleted before asking the MBean to dump the heap to that location.
