Order char encoding filter so it sets encoding before request is read

For the character encoding filter to work, it's vital that it sets
the request's encoding before any other filters attempt to read the
request. This commit updates the order of
OrderedCharacterEncodingFilter to be HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE and improves
the existing test to check that the ordering is as required.
