Clarify precedence of property sources

When the `locations` attribute is set for a given bean annotated with
`@ConfigurationProperties`, the configuration at these specified
locations take precedence over any other property sources. This means
that such values can't be overridden by a system property or a command
line switch for instance.

This commit clarifies this rules in the documentation.

Closes gh-5111
