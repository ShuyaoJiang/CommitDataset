Deprecate RouterFunctionMetrics

Spring Boot now deploys both annotation-based and functional endpoints
under the same `HttpHandler`; this means the currently auto-configured
`MetricsWebFilter` is instrumenting all endpoints to produce metrics.

There is no need for a WebFlux functional specific support.
This commit removes mentions of `RouterFunctionMetrics` in the docs and
deprecates that class.

Closes gh-12833
