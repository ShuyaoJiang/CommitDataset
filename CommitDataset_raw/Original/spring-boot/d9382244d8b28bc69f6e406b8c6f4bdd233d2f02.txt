Handle mixture of encoded and unencoded chars in JarURLConnection

Previously, JarURLConnection would corrupt a URL that contained a
mixture of encoded and unencoded double-byte characters. URLs that
only contained unencoded double-byte characters were not affected as
they are passed through as-is.

This commit updates JarURLConnection.JarEntryName to correctly handle
characters with a value that won't fit in a single signed byte (a
value greater than 127). Such characters are now URL encoded and then
written to the output stream as multiple bytes.

Closes gh-5194
