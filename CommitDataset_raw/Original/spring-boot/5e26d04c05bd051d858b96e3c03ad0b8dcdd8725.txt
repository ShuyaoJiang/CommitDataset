Only generate time-to-live property for matching endpoints

This commit makes sure that a "cache.time-to-live" property is not
generated for endpoints that do not have a main read operation (i.e. a
read operation with no parameter or only nullable parameters).

This matches the endpoint feature that provides caching for only such
operation.

Closes gh-11703
