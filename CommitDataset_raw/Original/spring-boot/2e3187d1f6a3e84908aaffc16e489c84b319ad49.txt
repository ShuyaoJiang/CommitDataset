Null values from yaml should be stored as empty string

When building a flattened map, the YamlProcessor from
Spring Framework, converts a null value to an empty string.
We want the null value to also keep track of its origin,
which is why this commit creates an `OriginTrackedValue`
for an empty string if the original value is null.

Fixes gh-10656
