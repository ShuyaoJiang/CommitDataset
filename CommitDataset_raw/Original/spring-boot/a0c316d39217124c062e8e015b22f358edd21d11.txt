Improve RepositoryRestConfiguration customization

This commit binds RepositoryRestConfiguration to the spring.data.rest
prefix so that any of its property can be customized through the
environment.

If a RepositoryRestMvcConfiguration is defined in the context, those
customization do not apply, as it was the case before.

Fixes gh-1171
