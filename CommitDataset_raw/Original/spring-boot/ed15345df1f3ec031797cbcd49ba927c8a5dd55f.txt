Try to make Jetty scan TLDs in nested JARs

Jetty apparently does it differently (different version of
Jasper maybe), so you need a unique jarFileURL for each
nested JAR (previously they were all set to the parent
archive URL).

Also added the root of the main archive as a valid
document root.

For gh-367
