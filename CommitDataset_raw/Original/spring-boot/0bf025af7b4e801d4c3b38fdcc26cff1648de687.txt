Add out-of-the-box support for status error pages

Allow convention based status error pages. Static HTML or templates
can be used by placing the appropriately named file under a `/error`
folder. For example:

	/src/main/resource/templates/error/404.ftl
or	/src/main/resource/public/error/404.html

Pages can also be named after the status series (5xx or 4xx).
