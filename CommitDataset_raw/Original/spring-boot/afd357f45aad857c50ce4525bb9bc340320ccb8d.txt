Reduce ConfigFileApplicationListener logs

Previously, all attempts to log a configuration file were logged at DEBUG
level which lead to a lot of noise as Spring Boot looks in many places by
default.

We now only log the files that are effectively found at DEBUG level and
all failed attempts at TRACE level.
