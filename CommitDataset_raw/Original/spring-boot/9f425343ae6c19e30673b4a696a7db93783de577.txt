Make FileSystemWatcherTests thread-safe

The list of changes is written to on one thread and read from on
another. Without some form of sychronization this is not thread-safe.

This commit makes changes a synchronized list which should guarantee
that the reading thread can see the changes made by the writing thread.
It also removes a redundant call to clear the list of changes at the
start of waitsForPollingInterval.
