Polish "Refactor Gradle plugin tests to use runner's plugin classpath"

This commit removes the need for the Kotlin plugin tests to continue
to set the plugin classpath in each test build script. This is
achieved by adding the jars files containing the Kotlin plugin and
its dependencies to the runner's plugin classpath in the same way as
was already done for the dependency management plugin.

Closes gh-14680
