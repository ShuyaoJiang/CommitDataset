Fix Couchbase condition on Spring Data class

This commit reverts 7e2d0fd so that the Couchbase auto-configuration can
work without Spring Data again. It also removes the `Class` reference to
a Spring Data class to a `String` reference to make sure the condition
operates properly when said class isn't on the classpath.

Closes gh-7453
