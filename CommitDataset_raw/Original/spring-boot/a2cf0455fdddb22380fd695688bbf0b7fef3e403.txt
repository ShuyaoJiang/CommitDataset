Fix static resource handling when run in IDE or using Maven or Gradle

The changes made for gh-8299 attempted to make static resource
handling consistent across Jetty, Tomcat, and Undertow. They did so
for application's launched using JarLauncher or WarLauncher but did
not consider application's launched in an IDE or using spring-boot:run
in Maven or bootRun in Gradle.

Running in an IDE or via Maven or Gradle introduces two new
resource locations:

 - Jars on the classpath with file protocol URLs (they are always
   jar protocol URLs when using either launcher)
 - Directories on the classpath from a project that is depended upon
   and contains resources in META-INF/resources

This commit updates the factories for all three containers to handle
these new resources locations. The integration tests have also been
updated.
