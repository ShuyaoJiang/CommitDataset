Analyse the environment for properties that are no longer supported

This commit adds a new `spring-boot-configuration-analyzer` module that
can be added to any app to analyze its environment on startup.

Each configuration key that has a matching replacement is temporarily
transitioned to the new name with a `WARN` report that lists all of
them.

If the project defines configuration keys that don't have a replacement,
an `ERROR` report lists them with more information if it is available.

Closes gh-11301
