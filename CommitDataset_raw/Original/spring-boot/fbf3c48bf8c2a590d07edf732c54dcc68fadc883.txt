Fix setter detection in `configprops` endpoint

Previously, the setter of a property whose second letter is upper-case (
such as `oAuth2Uri`) was not detected properly. The JavaBean spec states
that, in such a case, the first letter should not be capitalized (i.e.
the setter should be `setoAuth2Uri` rather than `setOAuth2Uri`).

This commit makes sure that Jackson uses standard bean names and fixes
the setter detection algorithm to take this case into account.

Closes gh-13878
