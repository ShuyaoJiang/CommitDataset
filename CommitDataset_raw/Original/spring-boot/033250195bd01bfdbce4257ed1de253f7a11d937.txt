Allow user to specify classLoader as loader property

PropertiesLauncher now supports creating its own class loader
from looader.classLoader property. It will succeed if the
implementation specified has a default constructor or one
that takes a parent class loader, or one that takes a URL[]
and a parent class loader (like URLClassLoader).
