Remove dependency from `root` to `condition`

Remove the slightly unusual dependency from the root autoconfigure
pacakge to `condition`. Prior to this commit the link was required in
ordere to populate the `ConditionEvaluationReport`. We now introduce
a `AutoConfigurationImportListener` strategy that allows anyone to
listen for AutoConfigurationImportEvents. The listener implementation
is now used to update the ConditionEvaluationReport.

Fixes gh-8073
