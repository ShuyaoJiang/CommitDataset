Deprecate micrometer meter's enabled flags

This commit deprecates the few 'enabled' flags that control whether
certain meter binders are registered in the context.

Metrics auto-configuration for the JVM, Logback and System-related
information have been moved to individual auto-configurations so that
they can be excluded rather than using the now deprecated flag.

This harmonizes our policy with regards to disabling behaviour,
especially since other similar auto-configurations do not have such
flag.

Closes gh-13408
