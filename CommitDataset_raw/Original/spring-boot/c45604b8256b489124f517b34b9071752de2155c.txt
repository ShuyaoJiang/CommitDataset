Ensure that Hibernate's JtaPlatform can be customized

Previously, when JpaProperties was applying additional properties it
discarded any existing properties. This meant that custom
configuration of Hibernate's JtaPlatform was not detected and that
Boot's SpringJtaPlatform would always be configured instead.

This commit updates JpaProperties to include all of the existing
properties when it's asked to apply any additional properties.
