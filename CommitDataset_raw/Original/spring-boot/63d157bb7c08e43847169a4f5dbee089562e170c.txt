Favor JSR-107 provider if present

Previously, native cache libraries were favored over a standard JSR-107
implementation. If a user has a working setup using JCache with one
provider and switch to another provider, his setup may be broken if we
happen to provide a native support for the new provider.

We now consistently favor JSR-107 if it is present. Native support can
still be enabled via the `spring.cache.type` property.

Closes gh-3822
