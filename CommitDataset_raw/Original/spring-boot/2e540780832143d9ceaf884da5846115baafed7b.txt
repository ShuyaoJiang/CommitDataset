Tolerate possible null Flyway MigrationVersion when using Flyway 4.0

Flyway 4.0 provides support for repeatable migrations that do not
have a version. When such a migration has been performed,
MigrationInfo.getMigrationVersion() will return null and, previously,
FlywayEndpoint would fail with an NPE.

This commit updates FlywayEndpoint to use null as the version when
MigrationInfo.getMigrationVersion() returns null.

Closes gh-5700
