Add `spring.pid.fail-on-write-error` support

Update `ApplicationPidFileWriter` to support a 'fail on write error'
properties which allows the user to exit the application if the PID
file cannot be written.

This commit also deprecates `spring.pidfile` in favor of
`spring.pid.file` so that the new property can be added without overlap.

Fixes gh-2764
