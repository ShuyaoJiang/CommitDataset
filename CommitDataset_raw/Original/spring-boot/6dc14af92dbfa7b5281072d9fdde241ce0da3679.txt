Update view of bean types when an override is detected

Previously, when a bean was overridden and its type changes,
BeanTypeRegistry could be left with a stale view of the bean's type.
This would lead to incorrect bean condition evaluation as conditions
would match or not match based on the bean's old type.

This commit updates the type registry to refresh its view of a bean's
type when its definition changes.

Closes gh-13588
