Allow user to supply servlets and filters and still get default DispatcherServlet

Instead of not installing one at all if there is any ServletContextInitializer,
Spring Boot will now install a DispatcherServlet if context does not contain one
already with the magic name "dispatcherServlet".

[Fixes #54674870] [bs-277]
