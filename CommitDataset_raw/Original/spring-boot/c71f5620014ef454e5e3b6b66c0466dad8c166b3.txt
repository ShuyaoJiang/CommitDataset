Provide dependency management for more of Apache Artemis

Previously, dependency management was provided for artemis-jms-client
and artemis-jms-server, but none of the other Artermis modules upon
which they depend. This made it possible for a mixture of versions
to end up on the classpath.

This commit adds dependency management for all of the Artemis modules
upon which artemis-jms-client and artemis-jms-server depends. It also
adds dependency management for artermis-amqp-protocol as proposed
in gh-5818

Closes gh-5818
Closes gh-5914
