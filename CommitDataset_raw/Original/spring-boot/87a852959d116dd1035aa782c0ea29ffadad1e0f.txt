Support logging.pattern.* properties with Log4J2

Update Log4J2 configurations to respect `FILE_LOG_PATTERN` and
`CONSOLE_LOG_PATTERN` system properties. These system properties are
set by `LoggingSystemProperties` from `logging.pattern.file` and
`logging.pattern.console` properties in the Spring Environment.

Fixes gh-7757
