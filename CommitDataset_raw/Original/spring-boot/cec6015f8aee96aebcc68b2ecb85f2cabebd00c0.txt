Cope with null server or management port when creating curie provider

Previously, a NullPointerException would occur if
endpoints.docs.curies.enabled was true and the default value was being
used for either server.port or management.port.

EndpointWebMvcHypermediaManagementContextConfiguration has been
restructured to ensure that the DocsMvcEndpoint bean is defined before
the condition on its existence is evaluated. Previously this was
dependant on the classâ€™s bean methods being processed in a particular
ordering, something that would be ok when using ASM but would vary when
using reflection.
