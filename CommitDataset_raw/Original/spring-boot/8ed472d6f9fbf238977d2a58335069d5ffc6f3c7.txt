Update logging listener to use normal stack trace ordering by default

Previously, LoggingApplicationListener used %rEx as the default
exception conversion word. This would result in the nested causes
being logging in reverse order, i.e. the most deeply nested cause
would be logged first.

This commit updates the default to be %wEx and adds a test to verify
the default behaviour.

Closes gh-4247
