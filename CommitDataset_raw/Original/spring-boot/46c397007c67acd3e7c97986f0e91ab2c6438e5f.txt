Avoid ClassCastExceptions in DevTools when using Spring HATEOAS

Spring HATEOAS’s DummyInvocationUtils, that is used by
ControllerLinkBuilder, uses Objenesis. By default, Objenesis caches
the instances that it creates and uses the class name as the cache key.
This is problematic when DevTools’ restart support is enabled as the
class loader changes with each restart and ClassCastExceptions occur
due to Objenesis returning a cached instance that was created by an
old restart class loader.

This commit works around the problem described above by auto-configuring
a bean that uses reflection to replace DummyInvocationUtils’ default
Objenesis instance with one that has caching disabled.

Closes gh-3784
