Ensure that JarResourceManager correctly handles path without leading /

Previously, JarResourceManager assumed that the path would begin with
a / but this isn't always the case. For example, it may be an empty
string. This could lead to a malformed jar:file: URL that used ! as
the separator rather than the required !/.

This commit updates JarResourceManager to prepend / to any path that
does not being with one before using it to construct the URL.

Closes gh-7717
