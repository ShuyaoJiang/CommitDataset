Perform background preinitialization once per class loader

Background preinitialization triggers static initialization of a
number of components that are slow to initialize. As the
initialization is static, it's only necessary once per class loader.

Previously, a new background preinitialization thread would be
created and started for each ApplicationEnvironmentPreparedEvent.
This commit updates the preinitializer to only create and start the
thread if preinitialization has not already been started for the
current class loader.

Closes gh-9869
