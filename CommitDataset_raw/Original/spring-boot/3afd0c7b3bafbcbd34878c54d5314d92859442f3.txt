Address Shellcheck warning (SC2086) for $arguments in launch script

$arguments needs to be split on spaces so it canâ€™t just be wrapped
in quotes. This commit updates arguments to be an array that is then
expanded ("{arguments[@]}"). The use of @ and double quotes means that
it is expanded into all elements individually quoted.
