Use relative paths so index is unaffected by its context path

Previously, index.html used absolute paths to load its CSS and
JavaScript. This meant that it had to be deployed to /. This commit
updates the HTML to use relative paths for its CSS and JavaScript,
thereby ensuring that they can be loaded irrespective of the context
path to which the application is deployed.

Closes gh-1988
