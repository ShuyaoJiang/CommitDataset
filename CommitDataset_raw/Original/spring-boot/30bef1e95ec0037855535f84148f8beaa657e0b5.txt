Add @ConditionalOnJava

Added a new @ConditionalOnJava annotation that allows to conditionally
enable configuration based on the Java version that is running. 

The annotation currently supports two modes of restricting Java versions:
the default mode checks for a Java version equal or better than the
requested one. Beyond that it can be configured to only match if Java
version is older than the configured one.
