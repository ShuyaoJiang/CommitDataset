Add an AuthoritiesExtractor strategy for UserInfoTokenServices

Default will extract an "authorities" key from the map coming from the
server. No existing servers I am aware of actually send that data, but
it might be helpful as a default nevertheless. User can override the
default by adding a bean of that type.

Fixes gh-3711
