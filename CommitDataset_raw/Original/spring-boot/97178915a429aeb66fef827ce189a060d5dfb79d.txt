Polish disk space health indicator

 - Supply auto-configuration for the new indicator
 - As suggested in the pull request, include the free disk space and
   configured threshold in the health details
 - Update the documentation to describe the indicator and its
   two configuration settings
 - Use @ConfigurationProperties to bind the indicator's configuration.
   This should make the changes sympathetic to the work being done
   to automate the configuration properties documentation

Closes gh-1297
