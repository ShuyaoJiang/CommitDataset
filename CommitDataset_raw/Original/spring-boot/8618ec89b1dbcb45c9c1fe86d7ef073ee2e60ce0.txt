Ensure that environment post processors are ordered correctly

Previously, ConfigFileApplicationListener would always add itself to the
end of the list of environment post processors loaded via
spring.factories. This meant that its order (highest precedence + 10)
would not be honoured and it would only be in the right place in the
list if any other post processors happened to have a higher precedence.

This commit updates ConfigFileApplicationListener to sort the list of
post processors using AnnotationAwareOrderComparator once its added
itself to the list.
