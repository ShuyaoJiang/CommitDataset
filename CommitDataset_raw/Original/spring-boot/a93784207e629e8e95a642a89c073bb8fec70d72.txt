Add jvmArguments property to maven plugin

The maven plugin now forks a new process when it starts a boot app. This
makes remote debugging of the app impossible without the ability to pass
extra JVM arguments.

This commit adds a "jvmArguments" attribute to the RunMojo that defines
additional JVM arguments to set on the forked process.

Fixes gh-848
