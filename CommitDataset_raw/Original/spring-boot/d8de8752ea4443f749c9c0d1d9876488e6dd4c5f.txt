Change metrics exporters to auto-configurations

Refactor `*ExportConfiguration` classes to be regular auto-configuration
classes.

Also removed the `@ConditionalOnProperty` guards for `.enabled` properties
since auto-configuration can now be excluded in the usual way. Enabled
properties remain where applicable and are adapted for Micrometer to use
as it sees fit.

Fixes gh-11838
