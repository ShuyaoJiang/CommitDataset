Use factoryBeanObjectType attribute to find factory bean to replace

Previously, MockitoPostProcessor would fail to replace a factory bean
with a mock if the factory bean didn't return a matching type from
getObjectType(). This prevented Spring Data respoitories from being
replaced with a mock as Spring Data's repository factory beans
generally do not know the specific repository type that they will
produce when MockPostProcesser (a bean factory post-processor) is
running.

Spring Data has been updated to add a factoryBeanObjectType attribute
to its factory bean definitions. MockitoPostProcessor has been updated
to look for FactoryBeans with this attribute and to use its value
to determine whether or not the factory bean produces a bean of the
required type and, therefore, should be replaced with a mock.
