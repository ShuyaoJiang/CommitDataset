Upgrade to Logback 1.1.10

In Logback 1.1.10, the logback-classic module contains a
META-INF/services/javax.servlet.ServletContainerInitializer file that
contains a comment. This triggers a bug in Wildfly 8 [1] that has been
fixed [2] in Wildfly 9 and later. As a result, this commit also
updates our Wildfly deployment test to use 9.0.2 rather than 8.2.0.

Closes gh-8354
