Fix relaxed binding of camel-case properties

Extended RelaxedDataBinder to include a case insensitive version of
SEPARATED_TO_CAMELCASE. This allow properties of the form TEST_THE_VALUE
to to bound to a @ConfigurationProperties class with a prefix of "test"
and a field of `theValue`.

Fixes gh-2304
