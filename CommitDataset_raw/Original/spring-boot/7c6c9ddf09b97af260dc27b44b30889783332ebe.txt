Refine duration converter for optional suffix

Update `StringToDurationConverter` so that the suffix is optional and
values such as `100`, `+100`, `-100` are assumed to be milliseconds.

Also add support for `@DurationUnit` to allow the unit to be changed
on a per-field basis (allowing for better back-compatibility).

Closes gh-11078
