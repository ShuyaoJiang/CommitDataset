Tweak Travis configuration as Surefire is now silent in quite mode

Surefire 2.20 is completely silent when running in quiet mode which
causes Travis to incorrectly detect that the build has hung. This
commit removes the use of quiet mode in the hope that it will
strike a reasonable balance between enough log output to prevent
a false positive for the build being hung while also not generating
so much output that Travis cannot cope.
