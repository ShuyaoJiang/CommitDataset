Bind empty string to empty collection or array of rich types

Previously, when an empty String was bound to a collection or
array of rich types it would fail as there was no converter capable
of creating a Collection<RichType> or RichType[] from the String.

This commit updates IndexedElementsBinder to apply special treatment
to empty String values. Now, when such a value is being processed,
an empty Collection or array is the result.

Closes gh-12965
