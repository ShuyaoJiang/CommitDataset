Add start/stop goals to maven plugin

SpringApplicationLifecycle provides lifecycle operations on the current
Spring Boot application. It can be registered as an MBean of the platform
MBean server if a specific property is set. Besides, the JMX name can
also be customized via a property in case more than one Spring Boot
application is started in the same process.

The Maven plugin uses that MBean to check that the application is ready
before ending the "start" phase. It uses it to trigger a proper shutdown
of the application during the "stop" phase.

If the process has to be forked, the platform MBean server is exposed on
a configurable port so that the maven plugin can connect to it.

Such change permits the maven plugin to integrate a classical integration
test scenario where the "start" goal is invoked during the
pre-integration phase and the "stop" goal during the post-integration
phase.

Closes gh-2525
