Allow to customize the path of a web endpoint

This commit introduces a endpoints.<id>.web.path generic property that
allows to customize the path of an endpoint. By default the path is the
same as the id of the endpoint.

Such customization does not apply for the CloudFoundry specific
endpoints.

Closes gh-10181
