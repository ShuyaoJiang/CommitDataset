Defensive check for cglib proxy in RequestMappingEndpoint

Since AbstractHandlerMethodMapping.getHandlerMap() is final it can't
be cglibbed and a proxy will barf if you try and call that method.
The RequestMappingEndpoint can be protected simply by defensively
checking if the mapping is a proxy before trying to inspect it.
