Remove closure-execution from OptionHandler

It seems that the code for executing a groovy closure from the
OptionHandler is never executed and therefore not needed.

Removing the code gives the benefit that the Groovy-classes are not
needed if someone else wants to use the spring-boot-cli infrastructure to
run his own cli interface.

Closes gh-4411
