Restore "exception first" logging

Effectively revert commit b396d0d2 to restore exception first logging
of exceptions for Logback and Log4j2.

This commit also introduces new extended versions of "whitespace"
padding exception loggers so that source jar information is still
included in the stacktrace.

Fixes gh-4247
