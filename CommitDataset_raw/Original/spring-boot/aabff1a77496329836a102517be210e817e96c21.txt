[bs-61] Allow non-default servlets and filters to be registered

* The RegistrationBean (ServletInitializer) now exposes a registration
target object, and this is used to prevent double registration of those
objects.
* If there is a Servlet with bean id "dispatcherServlet" it is mapped to
"/" (unless already registered as a ServletRegistrationBean).

[Fixes #48645559]
