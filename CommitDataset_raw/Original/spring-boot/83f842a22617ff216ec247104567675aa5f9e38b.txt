Reinstate support for relaxed binding for endpoint enablement

This commit improves upon the changes made in a8bf9d3 by adding
support for relaxed binding of the endpoints.enabled and
endpoints.<name>.enabled properties. This is achieved by replacing
use of @ConditionalOnExpression (which does not support relaxed
binding) with a custom condition implementation that uses
RelaxedPropertyResolver.

Closes gh-2767
