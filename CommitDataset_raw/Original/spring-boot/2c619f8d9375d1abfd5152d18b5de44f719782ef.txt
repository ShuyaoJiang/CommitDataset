Make launch script integration tests compatible with Spring Framework 4.3

Previously, the launch script integration tests used Jackson 2.1 to
align with the requirements of docker-java 2.x. This stopped working
when we upgraded to Spring Framework 4.3 which requires Jackson 2.6+.

This commit updates the launch script integration tests to use
docker-java 3.0.0-RC1 which is compatible with Jackson 2.6.x. An added
benefit is that 3.0 also adds support for copying an archive to a
container, allowing the custom command that performs this function to
be removed.
