Disable addResources by default

Flip the default value of `addResources` for both the Maven and Gradle
plugins. This effectively turns off static resources reloading and, more
importantly, the pruning of duplicate resources from the target
directory.

As devetools is our mainstram solution for such feature, the documantion
has been updated to reflect that.

Closes gh-4227
