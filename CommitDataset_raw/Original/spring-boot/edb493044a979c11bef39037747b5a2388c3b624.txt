Fix ordering problem in PropertySourcesPropertyValues

This affected @ConfigurationProperties binding whenever there
were multiple PropertySources (from any source) in the
Environment and mor ethan one carried a value for a particular
key. The rules for override are clear in Environment.getProperty()
but they were being violated by the PropertySourcesPropertyValues.

Fixes gh-916
