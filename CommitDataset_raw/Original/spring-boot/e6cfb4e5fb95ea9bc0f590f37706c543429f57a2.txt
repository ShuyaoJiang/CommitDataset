Improve diagnostics when reading a nested jar throws a runtime exception

Previously, only IOExceptions were caught and wrapped in a new
IOException that included the name of the nested entry that was
being read.

Following this commit, any Exception is caught and wrapped so that the
problematic entry can be identified in more failure scenarios.

Closes gh-8711
