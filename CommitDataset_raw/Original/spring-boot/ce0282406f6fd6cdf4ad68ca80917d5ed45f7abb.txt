Skip lazy init for beans that explicitly set lazy to false

This commit also adds tests to ensure that the child
management context works when lazy initialization is
enabled. Also, it adds a BeanFactoryPostProcessor to
the child context so that the server is created and
listening for requests but other beans in the child
context are not created until requested.
