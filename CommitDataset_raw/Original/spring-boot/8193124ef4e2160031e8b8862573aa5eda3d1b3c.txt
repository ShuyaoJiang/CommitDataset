Use Reactor BOM in Boot dependency management

This commit replaces the manual management of reactor dependencies by
the new Reactor BOM, version "Aluminium-RELEASE".

Overriding the reactor dependency versions in a Boot application now
requires to use the `reactor-bom.version` property.

Fixes gh-7028
