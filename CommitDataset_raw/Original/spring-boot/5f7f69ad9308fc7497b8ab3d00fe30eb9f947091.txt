[bs-132] Actuator should use delegating version of MVC support

The delegating version delegates to other configurers, and it's what
@EnableWebMvc uses.  You effectively switch off the delegation if you
use the base class by mistake.

[Fixes #50267017] [bs-132] Static resources in /css/**
cannot be served by Actuator project
