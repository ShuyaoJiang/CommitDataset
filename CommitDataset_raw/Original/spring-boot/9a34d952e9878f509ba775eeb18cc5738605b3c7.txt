Provide an alternative to `spring.activemq.pool.configuration`

This commit expands the support of PooledConnectionFactory so that
binding the third party object is no longer necessary. All 3rd party
properties are now deprecated in favour of our explicit support.

The main reason behind this change is that a `connection-factory` and
`properties` property were exposed. The former is used to set the
`ConnectionFactory` and makes no sense as a key. The latter is
rebuilding the underlying `ActiveMQConnectionFactory` at each call
without reusing any existing settings.

Closes gh-9837
