Remove HSQLDB dependency from Batch Starter

This commit removes HSQLDB dependency from Batch Starter as most apps
that use Spring Batch will prefer to use a RDBMS of their choice to store
batch metadata.

Additionally, explicit spring-jdbc dependency has been replaced with JDBC
Starter dependency.
