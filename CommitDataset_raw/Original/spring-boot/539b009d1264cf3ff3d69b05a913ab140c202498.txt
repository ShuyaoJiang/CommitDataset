Clean management context path if necessary

Various areas of the code expect the management's context path to not
contain any trailing slash but nothing is enforcing it. We now make sure
to remove any trailing slash, including the one for '/' and make that
explicit via the Javadoc of the getter.

Fixes gh-3553
