Prevent ApplicationListener that depends on EMF from creating a cycle

Previously, when an EntityManagerFactory was being initialized
synchronously, the DataSourceSchemaCreatedEvent would be published
during its initialization. This meant that an application listener that
depends on the EntityManagerFactory would create a dependency cycle if
it was a potential recipient of the event.

For the synchronous case, this commit moves the publication of the
event so that it occurs after the initialisation of the entity manager
factory. This allows an application listener that is a potential
recipient of the DataSourceSchemaCreatedEvent to depend on the
EntityManagerFactory without creating a cycle.

Closes gh-14651
