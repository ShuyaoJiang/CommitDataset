Servlet context document root not found when running as exploded WAR

* Added additional search in
AbstractEmbeddedServletContainerFactory.getValidDocumentRoot() to
detect a /WEB-INF/ directory in the code archive
* If the code archive is in /WEB-INF/** then we assume it is
safe to serve content from / (exposes the loader classes
but nothing sensitive from the app)

[Fixes #54345578]
