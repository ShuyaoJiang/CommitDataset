Refactor YAML profile to deal with "!" profiles

Drop `SpringProfileDocumentMatcher` and replace it with two new
implementations that restrict when YAML documents are loaded. YAML
sections are now restricted both on the specific profile that is being
loaded, and the profiles that are currently accepted.

The `PropertySourceLoader` interface has been refined to include a
predicate that determines when a profile is accepted. The
`ConfigFileApplicationListener` simply delegates the predicate logic to
the `Environment`.

Fixes gh-8011
