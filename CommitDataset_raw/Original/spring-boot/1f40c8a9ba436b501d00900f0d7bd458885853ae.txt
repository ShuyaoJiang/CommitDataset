Tolerate breaking API changes in ActiveMQ 5.11.0

In ActiveMQ 5.11 the signature of
PooledConnectionFactory.setConnectionFactory has changed. It now takes
an Object rather than a ConnectionFactory. This change is not binary
backwards compatible so it causes a NoSuchMethodError as we compile
against 5.10.

This commit updates ActiveMQConnectionFactoryConfiguration to call
the setConnectionFactory method reflectively, looking for both the
ConnectionFactory and Object variants.

Closes gh-2640
