Enable prefix by default on RedisCacheManager

An overhaul of the `RedisCacheManager` is expected in Hopper (to be
consumed by Spring Boot 1.4). One of those changes is to make sure every
key have a decent prefix by default.

This commit enables the use of prefix as it is disabled by default.

Closes gh-5175
