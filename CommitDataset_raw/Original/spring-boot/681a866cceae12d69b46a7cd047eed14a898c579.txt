Exclude Java agents from class loader created by PropertiesLauncher

PropertiesLauncher creates a ClassLoader that is used by the Launcher
to load an application’s classes. During the creation of this
ClassLoader URLs from its ClassLoader. This resulted resulting in Java
agents that are added to the system class loader via the -javaagent
launch option being available on both the system class loader and the
created class loader. Java agents are intended to always be loaded by
the system class loader. Making them available on another class loader
breaks this model.

This is the same problem that was in ExecutableArchiveLauncher and
that was fixed in ee08667e (see gh-863).

This commit updates PropertiesLauncher so that it skips the URLs of
any Java agents (found by examining the JVM’s input arguments) when
copying URLs over to the new ClassLoader, thereby ensuring that Java
agents are only ever loaded by the system class loader.

Closes gh-4911
