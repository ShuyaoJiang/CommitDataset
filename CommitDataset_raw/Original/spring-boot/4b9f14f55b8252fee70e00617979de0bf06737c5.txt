Separate out the auto-configuration of Spring Data’s web support

Previously, Spring Data’s web support was auto-configured as part of the
JPA repositories auto-configuration. However, Spring Data’s web support
isn’t dependent on the use of Spring Data JPA or even repositories.

This commit moves the auto-configuration into a standalone class, making
it independent of the use of Spring Data JPA and Spring Data
repositories.

Closes gh-1097
