Restore trace request param behaviour with error controller

This commits restores the behaviour of Spring Boot 1.x with regards to
the "trace" request param used to add the stacktrace to the model.

This was inadvertently changed so that the stacktrace would be added
if the parameter wasn't set.

Closes gh-14171
