Allow mongo port, host, and credentials to be configured individually

Previously, the host had to have a custom value for the configuration
of the port or credentials (username and password) to take effect. This
meant, for example, that you couldnâ€™t just set the port or just set the
username and password while using the default host.

This commit allows the port or username and password to be configured
without also configuring the host. The default host (localhost) and
port (27017) are retained.

Fixes gh-2008
