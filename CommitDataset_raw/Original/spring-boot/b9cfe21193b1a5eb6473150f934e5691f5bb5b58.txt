Make @ImportAutoConfiguration not register package

Update `@ImportAutoConfiguration` so that it is no longer annotated with
`@AutoConfigurationPackage` and as such isn't a marker for
`AutoConfigurationPackages`.

Having `@ImportAutoConfiguration` marked as an auto-configuration
package is particularly problematic in tests since it frequently breaks
context caching.

Fixes gh-9282
