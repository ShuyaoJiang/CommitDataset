Add auto-configuration for Jackson's JodaTime and JSR-310 modules

We now register the Jackson JodaTime module with Jackson ObjectMappers
if it is on the classpath. We also register the JSR-310 module if it's
on the classpath and the application is running Java 8 or better.

Extracted the Jackson specific configuration previously residing in
HttpMessageConvertersAutoConfiguration into a JacksonAutoConfiguration
class.

Added the Jackson JSR-310 module as a managed Boot dependency.
