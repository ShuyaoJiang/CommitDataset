Special case for root of classpath resource in archive

This turns out to affect JPA, but only because it looks for a URL for the
root of the classpath using ClassLoader.getResource("") which barfs in
an app launched from an executable JAR. It's easy to make a special case
for "" in the class loader, so I went ahead and did that. Possibly need
to think what the implication of getResources("") is as well (not
tested in an app yet).

Fixes gh-420
