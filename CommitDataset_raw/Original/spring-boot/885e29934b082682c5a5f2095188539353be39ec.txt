Clean HibernateJpaAutoConfigurationTests

This commit makes sure that each test runs with the proper datasource
auto-configuration and with an isolated embedded database. This allows
to restrict each test to only what it is supposed to do (rather than
disabling initialization to work around the fact that database is not
in a proper state because it is shared).

Closes gh-9579
