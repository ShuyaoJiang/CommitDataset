Add auto-configuration support for TaskExecutor

This commit adds support for providing a default ThreadPoolTaskExecutor
with sensible defaults. A new TaskExecutorBuilder is provided with
defaults from the `spring.task.*` namespace and can be used to create
custom instances.

If no custom `Executor` bean is present, `@EnableAsync` now uses the
auto-configure application task executor. Same goes for the async support
in Spring MVC.

Closes gh-1563
