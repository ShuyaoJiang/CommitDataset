Add username/password and MongoClientOptions to Mongo config

The username/password option stil lonly works for a single host (to
connect to a cluster I suspect you need to set the URI). Also added
a MongoClientOptions (if a bean of that type exists it will be
used to populate the options that aren't in the URI).

Fixed gh-536
