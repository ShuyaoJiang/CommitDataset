Develop bootstrap maven plugin

Develop a maven plugin that can be used to package executable jar/war
archives. The plugin is intended to be used as a drop-in replacement
for the standard maven-jar-plugin. To use the plugin declare it with
<extensions>true</extensions> then set the project type to
'executable-jar' or 'executable-war'.

Configuration options for 'executable-war' generation are intentionally
much more limited then the standard maven-war-plugin (for example
overlays are not supported). It is anticipated that builds requiring
complex configuration will continue to use the standard plugin in
combination with a custom assembly.
