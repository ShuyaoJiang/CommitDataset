Don't quit application on restart failures

Update `Restarter` to support a `FailureHandler` strategy that can be
used to determine how to deal with errors. The
`LocalDevToolsAutoConfiguration` now uses a strategy that doesn't quit
the application, but instead continues to wait for further file changes.

This helps make restart much more usable in situations where you
accidentally break code.

Fixes gh-3210
