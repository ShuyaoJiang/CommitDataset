Polish "Add global support for JMX unique names"

This commit ensures that the new "spring.jmx.unique-names" property
deprecates the Endpoint's specific property as they share the same goal.

If both are set with an incompatible value, an exception is thrown
inviting the user to update their configuration.

Closes gh-13990
