Start building against Neo4j OGM 3.0.0 snapshots

This commit our Neo4j OGM dependency with the Spring Data Neo4j
snapshots that are currently included in snapshots of Spring Data Kay.

It switches to using Neo4j's Bolt driver by default, aligning it with
the default of the latest Spring Data Neo4j 5 snapshots.

It also contains a workaround for a Neo4j OGM issue [1] and a change
to Neo4jDataAutoConfigurationTests that prevents the entire classpath
from being scanned.

See gh-8687
