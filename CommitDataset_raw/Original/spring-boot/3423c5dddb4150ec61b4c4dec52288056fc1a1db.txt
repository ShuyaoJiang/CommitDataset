Detect DispatcherServlets registered via ServletRegistrationBean

Previously, when a DispatcherServlet was registered via a
ServletRegistrationBean, the mappings endpoint did not expose any
information about it as it wasn't detected.

This commit fixes the detection of available DispatcherServlets in the
context so that the mappings endpoint include them all.

Closes gh-13186
