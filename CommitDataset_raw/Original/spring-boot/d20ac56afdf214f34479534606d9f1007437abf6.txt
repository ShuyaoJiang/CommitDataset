Align our jar URL stream handler with the JDK's

Previously our handler didn't override parseURL or sameFile which
resulted in behaviour that differed from that of the JDK's handler.
Crucially, this would result in our JarURLConnection being passed
a spec that didn't contain a "!/". A knock-on effect of this was
that the connection would point to the root of the jar rather than
the intended entry.

Closes gh-7021
