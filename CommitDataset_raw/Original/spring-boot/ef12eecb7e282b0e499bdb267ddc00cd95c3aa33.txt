Avoid a clash with TomcatURLStreamHandlerFactory

In the unlikely (outside the tests of a number of Spring Boot's
modules) event that both Tomcat and Jetty are on the classpath,
there's a risk that Tomcat will try to register its
URLStreamHandlerFactory after JasperInitializer has registered its
WarUrlStreamHandlerFactory. Should this happen, Tomcat will fail to
start.

TomcatURLStreamHandlerFactory registers a handler for the war: URLs
produced by org.apache.tomcat.util.scan.JarFactory that's used by
both Tomcat and Jetty's Jasper integration. This makes it a suitable
replacement for WarUrlStreamHandlerFactory so this commit updates
JasperIntializer to register TomcatURLStreamHandlerFactory when it's
available, falling back to WarUrlStreamHandlerFactory when it's not.

Closes gh-8622
