Restore LoggingSystems’ previous cleanup behaviour

This commit reverts the changes made for gh-4026. Those changes updated
each LoggingSystem to close/stop the underlying logging system as part
of the clean up processing. Unfortunately, this approach doesn’t work
in an environment where their are multiple application contexts and
some have a shorter lifecycle than the “main” application context. In
such an environment, closing an application context with a shorter
lifecycle prior to the main application context being closed will
close/stop the main application context’s logging system as, rather than
being scoped to an application context, a logging system is shared
across multiple application contexts. (The exact details of how widely
shared the logging system is varies between logging systems and, in the
case of Logback and Log4J2, also depends on which ContextSelector
implementation is being used.
