Disable Jetty's default Server header

Following the upgrade to Tomcat 8.5, Jetty became the only container
that sends a Server header by default. This commit updates the factory
for Jetty to disable the default Server header bringing it into line
with Tomcat and Undertow.

All three containers continue to support server.server-header which
can be used to configure a custom server header.

Closes gh-4730
