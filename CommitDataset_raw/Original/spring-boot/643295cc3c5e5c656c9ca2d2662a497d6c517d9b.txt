Separate Application Listener and Initializer

Update SpringApplication so that ApplicationListener and
ApplicationInitializer methods must be called separately. This helps
to prevent unexpected side effects when calling the setters and
also encourages separation of concerns.

The few situations where a class was both an ApplicationInitializer
and ApplicationListener are now handled by registering an inner
listener from the `initialize` method.
