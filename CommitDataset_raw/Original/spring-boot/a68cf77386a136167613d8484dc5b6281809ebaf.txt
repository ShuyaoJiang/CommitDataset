Upgrade to Tomcat 8.5.5

As part of the upgrade, Tomcat now requires a keystore to contain
an X.509 certificate. The two stores used in our tests have been
updated by exporting their private keys and adding them as
certificates. For example:

$ keytool -exportcert -keystore test.jks -alias tomcat > exported
$ keytool -importcert -keystore test.jks -file exported
