VcapApplicationListener Boolean Credentials

Previously, the VcapApplicationListener would discard any service
credential value that wasn't a String, Number, Map, Collection, or
null.  This was particularly a problem for services that exposed a
value as a JSON boolean.  This change takes booleans in the credential
payload into account, converting them to Strings so that they will
pass through the properties system properly.  There's no real downside
to this as Spring will coerce them back into Booleans if needed, by
the application.

Fixes gh-3237
