Retry upload for any SocketException not just a ConnectException

Previously, DevTools would retry the upload of the changes to an
application in the event of a ConnectException. If a different
network-level failure occurred, it would not be retried and would
cause the file watching thread to die.

This commit attempts to make things more robust by retrying all
SocketExceptions and not just ConnectExceptions. A warning is
logged when a failure occurs. A separate debug message that
includes the exception is also logged.

Closes gh-10317
