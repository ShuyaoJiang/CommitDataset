Close RandomAccessDataFile when direct JarFile is closed

Previously, the underlying RandomAccessDataFile was not closed when
the JarFile that was using it was closed. This causes a problem on
Windows as the open file handle prevents the file from being deleted.

This commit updates JarFile to close the underlying
RandomAccessDataFile when it is closed and has a JarFileType of
DIRECT.

Previously, when accessing the manifest of a jar file that maps to a
nested directory (BOOT-INF/classes) a new JarFile was created from the
root jar file, the manifest was retrieved, and the new JarFile was
closed. This could lead to the underlying RandomAccessDataFile being
closed while it was still in use.

This commit improves JarFile to retrieve the manifest from the
existing outer JarFile, thereby avoiding the need to create and close
a new JarFile.

Unfortunately, PropertiesLauncher creates a number of scenarios where
a JarFile with a type of direct is closed while itâ€™s still being used.
To accommodate this behaviour, RandomAccessDataFile has been updated
so that it can re-open the underlying RandomAccessFile if it is used
after it has been closed.

Closes gh-12296
