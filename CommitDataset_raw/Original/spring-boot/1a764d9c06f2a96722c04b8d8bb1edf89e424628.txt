Default Tomcat to not save SESSIONS.ser file

Update TomcatEmbeddedServletContainerFactory so that session data isn't
serialized by default. Prior to this commit the SESSIONS.ser file would
either be written to `/tmp` or into `baseDir` (if one was set).

By not saving session data we align Tomcat with the other embedded
servlet containers and reduce the risk of sensitive information being
left in `/tmp`.

Fixes gh-4156
