Support of spring initializr meta-data v2.1

Update the `init` command to support the latest meta-data format. Recent
Spring Initializr version also supports Spring Boot CLI now and generates
a textual service capabilities when requested. The command no longer
generates the capabilities of the service unless said service does not
support it.
