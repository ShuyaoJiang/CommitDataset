Provide M2E lifecycle mapping metadata for Maven plugin’s build-info goal

Previously, configuring the build-info goal in a pom would result in 
Eclipse reporting an error for the pom as it didn’t know if/when to
execute the build-info goal.

This commit adds lifecycle mapping metadata so that the goal is executed
on incremental builds. This ensures that the contents of the generated
file are kept up-to-date, reflecting the latest build time, etc.

Closes gh-6723
