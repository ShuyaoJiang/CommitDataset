Extract user info rest template into a factory

Instead of using a @Bean, it is better to use an opaque factory
for an internal dependency that users are not going to want in
the context. OAuth2RestTemplate is a common enough bean type that
creating on in autoconfig makes it hard for users to add their own
for business use.
