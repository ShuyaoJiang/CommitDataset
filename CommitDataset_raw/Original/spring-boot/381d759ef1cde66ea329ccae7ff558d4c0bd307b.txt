Support server.compression with reactive servers

This commit adds support for HTTP compression with reactive servers,
with the following exceptions:

* `server.compression.mime-types` and
`server.compression.exclude-user-agents` are not supported by Reactor
Netty at the moment

* `server.compression.min-response-size` is only supported by Reactor
Netty right now, since other implementations rely on the
`"Content-Length"` HTTP response header to measure the response size
and most reactive responses are using `"Transfer-Encoding: chunked"`.

Closes gh-10782
