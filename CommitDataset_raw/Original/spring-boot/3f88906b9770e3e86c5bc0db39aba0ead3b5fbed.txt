Fix handling of ResponseStatusException

This commit updates DefaultErrorAttributes to handle
ResponseStatusException explicitly. This exception is used in a
WebFlux application to signal that the processing of the query has
failed with an HTTP status code and a reason phrase. The latter is now
properly mapped to the `message` attribute of the response body.

Closes gh-11614
