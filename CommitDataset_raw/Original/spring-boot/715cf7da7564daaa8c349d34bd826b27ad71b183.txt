Do not enable cglib if spring.aop.proxy-target-class is configured

This commit makes sure to honour the `spring.aop.proxy-target-class`
property if set by the user. Previously, the
`PersistenceExceptionTranslationPostProcessor` was always configured to
use cglib, regardless of the value of that property.

Closes gh-8887
