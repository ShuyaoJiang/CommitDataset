Improve NoSuchBeanDefinitionFailureAnalyzer to handle null beans

Previously, if a user defines a `@Bean` with a method that returns
`null`, injection by type will ignore that definition but the report
doesn't mention that candidate.

This commit improves the failure analyzer to look for user-defined beans
as well, detecting beans that are `null` matching the requested type
and including them in the report.

Closes gh-13531
