Adapt WebFlux.fn auto-config to SPR-15536

Since SPR-15536, WebFlux.fn is now configured with `@EnableWebFlux`,
along the annotated controllers. Both `RouterFunction` and Controller
instances can now live within the same application and they share
the same web infrastructure.

This commit removes the custom auto-configuration for `RouterFunction`
and relies on `@EnableWebFlux` for that.

Closes gh-9165
