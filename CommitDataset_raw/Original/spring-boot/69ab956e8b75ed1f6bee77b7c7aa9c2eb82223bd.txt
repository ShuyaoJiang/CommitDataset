Stop assuming datasource creation failure originates from auto-config

There are documented way to reuse bits of the infrastructure in user
config to offer similar datasource configuration. If that fails, the
regular failure there will kick in.

This commit improves `DataSourceBeanCreationFailureAnalyzer` to not
misguide users that the auto-configuration has failed. Rather, it
describes what has failed in a more generic way.

Closes gh-12947
