Stop MetricsEndpoint from summing up same metrics

Update `MetricsEndpoint` so that only the first matching meter is used
when calculating the sum of of statistics.

Prior this this commit the endpoint would consider all Meters. This
caused incorrect statistics when multiple back-end systems were being
used since the registries contained in the `CompositeMeterRegistry`
would be  iterated, and the same effective metric would be counted more
than once.

Closes gh-14497
