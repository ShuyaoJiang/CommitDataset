Upgrade to Spring Social Facebook 2.0.1.RELEASE

While this is a breaking change, continuing with Spring Social
Facebook 1.1.x is also broken as it is no longer compatible with
Facebook's API. Upgrading to 2.0.1.RELEASE may require some changes
to be made to users' applications, but it will allow their
applications to use the Facebook API once again.

Closes gh-2837
