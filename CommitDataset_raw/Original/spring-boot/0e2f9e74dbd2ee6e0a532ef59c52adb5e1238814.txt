Ensure a JreProxySelector is applied as a fallback

The issue was that the JreProxySelector was only applied
if the existing selector was null, but that hasn't been the case
since we added supporty for settings.xml. The strategy now is to
fallback to a JreProxySelector if the existing one is null
or not already a composite. Fixes gh-914.
