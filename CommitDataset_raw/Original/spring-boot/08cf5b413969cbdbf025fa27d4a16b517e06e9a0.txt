Use additional properties instead of default args

SpringApplication (and the builder) now do not accept default
command line args because the override semantics were wrong -
you need to be able to override them with everything, including
system properties and external properties (per profile).

Also implements new semantics for profiles - you can add
additional profiles in the Java API and they will not be
squashed by command line or system properties entries for
spring.profiles.active.
