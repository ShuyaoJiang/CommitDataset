Implement simpler exclusion logic for Gradle

Simplify the exclusion logic used in Gradle by implementing implicit
exclusions rather than trying to detect transitive excludes.

This commit reverts much of the code originally included to fix gh-1047
which adds far too much complexity to the build and still doesn't solve
the underlying issue.

Fixes gh-1103
