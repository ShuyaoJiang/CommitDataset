Fix spring.active.profiles repeated loading

Fix `ConfigFileApplicationListener` to repeatedly load property sources
and activate profiles using any defined `spring.active.profiles`
properties.

This restores the ability to have a property in a profile specific
file that defines additional profiles.

Fixes gh-308
