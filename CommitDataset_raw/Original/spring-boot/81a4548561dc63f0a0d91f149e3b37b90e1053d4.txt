Ensure embedded containers actually stop if there is an error on startup

Both embedded containers need to be checked after starting to ensure that they
are actually running. With Jetty it's just a question of catching an exception
but with Tomcat it's harder (the current solution involves duplicating some
code from initialize() into start() essentially checking the lifecycle state).

Also adjusted the log levels to prevent noise at WARN level by default when
this happens (since the exception is logged and rethrown anyway).

There is still the issue of whether to fail the build in Maven or Gradle
(separate issue really).

Fixes gh-1232
