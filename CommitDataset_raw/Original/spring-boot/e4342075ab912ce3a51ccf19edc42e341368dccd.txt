Fix class loading problem with DevTools and Spring Session with Redis

Previously, when a session attribute that had been stored in Redis was
being deserialized, the app class loader would be used. This would
result in a ClassCastException if the attribute was an instance of a
class visible to the restart class loader.

This commit auto-configures Spring Sessionâ€™s RedisTemplate to use a
custom deserializer that uses the restart class loader when
deserializing session attributes.

Closes gh-3805
