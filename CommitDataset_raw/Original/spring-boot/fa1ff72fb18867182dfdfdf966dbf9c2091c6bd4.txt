Restore quiet logging on startup

Reinstate initializeWithSensibleDefaults() on AbstractLoggingSystem
beforeInitialize(). This is required to ensure no superfluous logging
output occurs when starting up a spring boot application from the
command line.

It appears that commit e9c649dfb2b1653f5e4f2fed421aa053e6fd42ce
modified the logic in an attempt to prevent double initialization.
