Allow multiple @EntityScan annotations to be used

Update EntityScanRegistrar so that multiple @EntityScan annotations can
be used with a single application. Previously, when an application used
multiple annotations only the first one found would get applied. This
changes alters that to augment the packages that will be scanned.

Fixes gh-2757
