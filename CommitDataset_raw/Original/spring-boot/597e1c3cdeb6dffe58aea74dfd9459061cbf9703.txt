Allow custom builder to be used in SpringBootServletInitializer

Previously, to use a custom SpringApplicationBuilder subclass in
SpringBootServletInitializer, it was necessary to either override
createRootApplicationContext or configure and duplicate the logic
that configures the builder with initializers, the context class, etc.

This commit introduces a new method, createSpringApplicationBuilder,
that can be overridden to use a custom builder without having to
duplicate any configuration logic.

Closes gh-2694
