[bs-72] Add Batch compiler by default

We could take this out again when we decide what to do about plugins
but it's good to have it in for now because it shows how to do it,
and exposes some holes.  The job.groovy script now works, but
a lot of it should be defaulted through auto-configuration.

(See also [bs-73] for a non-Batch related bug.)
