Upgrade to Spring Data Evans

The missing bean condition on the auto-configuration classes for
Elasticsearch, Jpa, Mongo and Solr repositories have been tightened to
look for ElasticsearchRepositoryFactoryBean, JapRepositoryFactoryBean,
MonoRepositoryFactoryBean, and SolrRepositoryFactoryBean respectively.

In Spring Data Evans, when there are multiple repository types on the
classpath, a strict mode is entered to prevent the different
repositories from trampling over each other. A side-effect of this is
that for the Mongo domain types in the tests to be discovered they
must be explicitly annotated with @Document.

Closes gh-1338
