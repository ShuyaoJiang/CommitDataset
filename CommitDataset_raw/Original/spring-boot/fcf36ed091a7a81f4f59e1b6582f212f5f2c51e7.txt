Avoid property name collisions when serializing AuditEvent to JSON

Previously, in case the data for the audit event contained an entry
with the key "type", the member `type` from the AuditEvent would be
overwritten when rendering to JSON due to the use of @JsonAnyGetter on
the data property.

This commit removes @JsonAnyGetter so that the data map is rendered as
a separate property in the JSON.

Closes gh-7990
