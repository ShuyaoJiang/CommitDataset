Add a workaround for DATACMNS-776

Spring Data’s web support includes a handler method argument resolver,
ProxyingHandlerMethodArgumentResolver, that inaccurately claims that it
can handle all interface handler method arguments. This causes problems
for handler methods that take Spring Mobile’s Device as an argument as
the proxied Device instance does not behave correctly.

This commit works around the problem by assigning an order to the 
WebMvcConfigurerAdapter that registers Spring Mobile’s argument resolver
with Spring MVC. This ordering ensures that Spring Mobile’s resolver
takes precedence over Spring Data’s for Device arguments.
