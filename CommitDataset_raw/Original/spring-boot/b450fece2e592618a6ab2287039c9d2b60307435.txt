Add NoSuchBeanDefinitionException failure analyzer

Add a `FailureAnalyzer` that handles the case where the context does
not start because no candidate bean was found for an `InjectionPoint`.

The implementation inspects the auto-configuration report for beans
that are candidate and output the condition(s) that lead to such beans
to be discarded on startup. If a whole auto-configuration class is
disabled (or excluded), its beans are inspected and candidates are
extracted in a similar way.

This works for both injection by type and by name.

Closes gh-6612
