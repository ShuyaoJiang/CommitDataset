Allow Elasticsearch client-transport-sniff to be configured via the env

Previously, a TransportClient sniff property could not be configured
while using Spring Bootâ€™s Elasticsearch auto-configuration. This commit
adds a new property, spring.data.elasticsearch.client-transport-sniff,
that can be used to configure the TransportClient while continuing to
use the auto-configuration support.

Closes gh-1838
