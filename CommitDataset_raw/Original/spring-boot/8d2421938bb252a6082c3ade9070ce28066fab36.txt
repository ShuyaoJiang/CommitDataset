Perform failure analysis of NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException

This commit introduces a new failure analyser for
NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException. The analyser provides details of the
consumer whose dependency could not be satisfied and the names and
sources of the non-unique beans.

This analysis requires access to the BeanFactory, so FailureAnalyzers
has been updated to support BeanFactory injection via an analyzer
implementing BeanFactoryAware.
