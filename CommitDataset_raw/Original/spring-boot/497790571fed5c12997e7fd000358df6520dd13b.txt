Add dependency management for logback-core

Previously, only dependency management for logback-classic was
provided. This meant that it was possible for logback-core, upon
which logback-classic depends, to have a different version.

This commit adds dependency management for logback-core, thereby
ensuring that the two dependencies will have the same version.

Closes gh-5304
