[bs-239] Race condition in embedded container contexts

I'll mark this as fixing the bug in tracker, but it might benefit
from some re-working at some point. The basic idea is to use
our old friend ContextRefreshedEvent to start the server listening
for connections. Delaying and making public the start() method from the
EmbeddedServletContainer doesn't help because you need the server to
start in order to get a ServletContext for Spring.

[Fixes #53538787]
