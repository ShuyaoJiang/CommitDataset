[BS-48] Add autoconfigured JMS support

* Add ability to detect spring-jms on the path and create a JmsTemplate with
  ActiveMQConnectionFactory
* Create tests showing autoconfigured JmsTemplate with ActiveMQ, but prove it
  backs off if a separate ConnectionFactory exists.
* Add support to spring-boot-cli to that it detects JmsTemplate, DefaultMessageListenerContainer,
  or SimpleMessageListenerContainer, and turns on autoconfiguration as well as
  add proper @Grab's and import statements.
* Write a jms.groovy test showing proper CLI support
