Stop JPA and a custom Flyway bean from causing a startup failure

Previously, if an application used JPA and declared its own Flyway bean,
startup would fail. The custom Flyway bean would switch off
auto-configuration of the FlywayMigrationInitializer bean but the
contextâ€™s entity manager factory beans would still be configured to
depend on the migration initialiser.

This commit splits the post-processor that configures the dependencies
into two. One that configures the dependency on the Flyway bean and
one that configures the dependency on the FlywayMigrationInitializer
bean. When to auto-configuration of the FlywayMigrationInitializer is
switched off, the auto-configuration of the latter dependency is also
switched off.
