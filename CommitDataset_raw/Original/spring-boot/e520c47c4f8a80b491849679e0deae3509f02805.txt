Refine `messages.properties` detection

Update `ResourceBundleCondition` to only enable the messages source
if `messages.properties` (and not `messages*.properties`) exists. This
operation is much faster that performing a pattern match since a full
jar entry scan is not required.

Since adding `messages.properties` is good practice and this change
allows us to delete the custom `PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver`
it seems like a fine compromise to make.
