Fix asciidoctor syntax problems and updgrade to asciidoctor 1.5

Points to note for authors:

* Nesting "*" in `literals` does not behave like Markdown - you have to
escape the asterisk (e.g. `foo/\*`)

* Quote ligatures (why we had to use those I don't really know) are
different in asciidoctor 1.5 ('`foo`' instead of ``foo'')
