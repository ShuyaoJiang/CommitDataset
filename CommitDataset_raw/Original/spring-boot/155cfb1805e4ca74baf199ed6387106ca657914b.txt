Fix boot curies href when server has custom servlet path

Previously, the servlet path was being applied twice. Once by the
code that sets up the DefaultCurieProvider and once by the provider
itself which uses ServletUriComponentBuilder's
fromCurrentServletMapping() to build the application URI.

This commit removes the duplicate logic when creating the
DefaultCurieProvider.

Closes gh-6585
