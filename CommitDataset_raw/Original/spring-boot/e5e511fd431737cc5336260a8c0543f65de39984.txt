Reinstate use of hasMappingForPattern

Use of hasMappingForPattern was commented out during work on the
Aether-based Grape implementation as it was temporarily removed in 
Spring 4's snapshots. It's since been reinstated in the snapshots, so
its use should have been reinstated prior to merging Aether work into
master.
