Update FilteredClassPathRunner so that JUnit rules work

Previously, the tests class and any JUnit annotations it contained were
loaded by a different class loader to JUnit. This meant that the JUnit
annotations were loaded twice and @Rule-annotated fields were not found.
This commit updates FitleredClassPathRunner to use a custom class loader
that ensures that any org.junit.* classes are only loaded by a single
class loader.
