Make Flyway and Liquibase endpoints conditional on a single candidate

Previously, auto-configuration of the Flyway and Liquibase endpoints
would fail if there were multiple Flyway or Spring Liquibase beans
in the application context.

This commit updates them so that they are now conditional on a single
candidate.

Closes gh-6609
