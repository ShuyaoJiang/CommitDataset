Allow auto-configure sort with incomplete chain

Update `AutoConfigurationSorter` so that all `@AutoConfigureBefore` and
`@AutoConfigureAfter` classes are considered even if they are ultimately
not part of the requested set.

Prior to this commit, given classes ordered with annotations such that
A -> B -> C a call to sort only [A, B] could return the incorrect order.

Fixes gh-12660
