Fix Jackson custom locale with Joda Time test on Java 9

The translations for the timezone names vary between Java 8 and Java
9. For example, with Java 9, UTC's name is no longer localized while
others have different localizations. This commit updates the test
to verify that the correct locale is being used while also tolerating
the different localization's of Java 8 and 9.
