Ensure that jar entry names use forward slashes, even on Windows

Previously, in the DevTools integration tests, portions of a File's
path were used to create the name of a jar entry. On Windows this
resulted in the entry containing \ characters. As a result the
directory structure was incorrect and the classes could not be loaded
from the jar.

This commit ensures that any \ characters are replaced with /
characters.
