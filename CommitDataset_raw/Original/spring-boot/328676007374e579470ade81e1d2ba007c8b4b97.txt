Make it easier to add auto-configuration to a test slice

Previously, an entry had to be added to spring.factories using the
name of one of the @AutoConfigure… meta-annotations on the @…Test
annotation as the key. This indirection was unnecessarily complicated.

This commit simplifies things by allowing the name of the @…Test
annotation itself to be used as the key.

Closes gh-6335
