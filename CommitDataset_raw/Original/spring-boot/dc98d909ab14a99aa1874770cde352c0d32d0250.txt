Support reactive web servers with LocalServerPort

This commit refactors the `EmbeddedWebServerInitializedEvent` hierarchy
to have one specialized event for Servlet based apps and another one for
reactive apps.

Each event implementation has:

* a specific `ApplicationContext` implementation for the app
* a custom `getServerId` implementation that differentiates the
application server from the management server

Closes gh-8348
