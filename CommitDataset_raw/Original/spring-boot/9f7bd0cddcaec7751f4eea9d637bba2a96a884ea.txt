Inject ResourceConfig instance (not class) into Jersey

If you inject the class (via a servlet parameter) it seems that
Jersey tries to create all the beans for you (and fails). I thought
it was supposed to work (according to the docs), so I'm a bit confused
but the sample now has Spring DI and the tests pass.

Fixes gh-1981
