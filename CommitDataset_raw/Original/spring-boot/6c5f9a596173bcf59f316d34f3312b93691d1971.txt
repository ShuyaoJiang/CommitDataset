[bs-150] Add HTML error page to Actuator UI apps

The ErrorEndpoint now handles text/html requests differently, delegating
to a View named "error". This view will not exist by default so the user
will see an ugly 500 error, but it's easy to fix and there isn't a good
to provide a default.

[Fixes #51214943]
