Apply standard Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder config via a customizer

This commit builds on the new abstraction introduced in 2a0b8a7 by
applying the standard JacksonProperties-based
Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder configuration via a customizer.

It also applies some polishing to the original contribution:

 - Code has been formatted
 - Logic that applies the customizers has moved to be alongside the code
   that creates the builder
 - Logic that explicitly sorted the customisers has been removed as
   they will be sorted automatically prior to injection
