Add explicit aliases for exclude and excludeName on SpringBootApplication

Previously, SpringBootApplication relied on implicity aliasing of
exclude and excludeName that worked because the two attributes have
the same names as the equivalent attributes on
EnableAutoConfiguration.

This commit updates SpringBootApplication to make the aliases explicit
and also adds tests to EnableAutoConfigurationImportSelectorTests to
verify that the aliasing is working as intended.

Closes gh-7951
