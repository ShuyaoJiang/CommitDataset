Support detection and with test initializers

Relax `SpringBootTestContextBootstrapper` rules so that a test can
specify an `ApplicationContextInitializer` and still have
`@SpringBootConfiguration` detected.

Prior to this commit detection would not occur because it's possible
that an initializer _could_ register configuration. This scenario is
actually quite unlikely to occur, certainly less likely than wanting to
use an initializer in combination with auto-detection.

Fixes gh-8483
