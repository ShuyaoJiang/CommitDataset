Don't use reflection to verify interceptor registration

A recent change to the internals of RequestMappingHandlerMapping
broke to Spring Mobile-related tests as they were using reflection
to verify that the configuration had been applied correctly.

This commit makes the tests more robust by using the Java API to
access the interceptors for a request and verify that the expected
interceptor is present. To further simplify the tests, the unnecessary
use of an embedded servlet container factory has also been removed.
