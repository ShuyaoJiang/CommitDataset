Remove spring-data release train BOM

Temporarily remove the spring-data release train BOM since it cannot
be resolved until it is published to maven central.

The previous solution of adding an additional repository has been
reverted as it will pollute POMS for users that inherit from the
spring-boot-starter-parent POM.
