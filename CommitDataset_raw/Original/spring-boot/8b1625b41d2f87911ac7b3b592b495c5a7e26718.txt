Short circuit binding if possible

Update the `Binder` to short circuit potentially expensive bean binding
if there are no known child properties. The shortcut can only be applied
when all used `ConfigurationPropertySources` return a non empty
`containsDescendantOf` result. This should be the case for most
Spring Boot applications, the exception being any apps that are running
in a security restricted environment.

Fixes gh-9023
