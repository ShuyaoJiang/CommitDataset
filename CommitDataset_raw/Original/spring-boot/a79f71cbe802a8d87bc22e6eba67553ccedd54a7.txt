Add @IntegrationComponentScan auto-configuration

Update Spring Integration auto-configuration so that
`@IntegrationComponentScan` from `AutoConfigurationPackages` is
implicitly applied. Prior to this commit `@MessagingGateway` interfaces
would only get picked up if `@IntegrationComponentScan` was added
alongside with the `@SpringBootApplication`.

Fixes gh-2037
Closes gh-7718
