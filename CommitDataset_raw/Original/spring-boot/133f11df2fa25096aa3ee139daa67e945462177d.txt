Refactor ConfigFileApplicationListener

Refactor `ConfigFileApplicationListener` to use a `MultiValueMap` when
loading sources. The helps to simplify the code and removes the need
for the inner `LoadedPropertySources` class. We're also able to delete
the now unused `EnumerableCompositePropertySource` and
`PropertySourcesLoader` classes.

Fixes gh-9144
