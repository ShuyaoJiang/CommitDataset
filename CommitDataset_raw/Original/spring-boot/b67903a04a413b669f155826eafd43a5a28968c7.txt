Keep "testdb" default datasource name internal

Previously, Hikari's pool name was auto-configured with the value of
`spring.datasource.name` that defaults  to `testdb`, which brings some
confusion.

This commit removes the default `testdb` value on
`spring.datasource.name` as it is a sane default only for an embedded
datasource. It is applied whenever applicable instead.

Closes gh-11719
