Include details in ElasticsearchRestHealthIndicator

This commit adds more information to the ElasticSearch REST
health indicator.

When the ES instance responds with an error HTTP status,
the health details now include the actual status code and reason phrase.
When the ES instance returns a HTTP 200 response, the entire response
map is used as health details.
