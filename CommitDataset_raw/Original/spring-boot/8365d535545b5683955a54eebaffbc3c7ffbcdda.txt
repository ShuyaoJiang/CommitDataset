Add support for JMS session caching

This commit adds support for CachingConnectionFactory for both Artemis
and ActiveMQ. If connection pooling is not enabled explicitly, sessions,
producers and consumers are cached. The factory can be further
customized, including reverting to the raw ConnectionFactory, using the
`spring.jms.*` namespace.

Closes gh-12161
