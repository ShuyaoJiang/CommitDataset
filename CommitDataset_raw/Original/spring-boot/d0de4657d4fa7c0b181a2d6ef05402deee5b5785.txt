Reduce ConfigurationPropertyName GC pressure

Rewrite `ConfigurationPropertyName` in an attempt to consume less memory
and to reduce GC pressure from `toString()`.

Prior to this commit the `toString()` method would always construct a
new value from the name elements. This is sub-optimal since on on many
occasions the `ConfigurationPropertyName` is created from an already
well-formed String. The updated code now attempts to directly use the
original value for both `toString` and `equals` whenever possible.

Further refinements have also been made to the way that elements are
stored. Rather than a list or objects, we now use arrays that contains
the split points and types. This helps to reduce the amount of memory
required to store the name.
