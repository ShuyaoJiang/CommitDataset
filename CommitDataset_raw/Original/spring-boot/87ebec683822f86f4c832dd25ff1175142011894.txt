Upgrade to Jackson 2.9.0.pr2

As part of the upgrade, this commit removes the use of any API that
has been deprecated in 2.9. This includes the config props endpoint's
use of SerializationFeature.WRITE_NULL_MAP_VALUES. This has been
replaced with configuring serialization inclusion to only include
properties with non-null values. This means that all null-valued
properties will no longer be serialized, not just those that are an
entry in a map.
