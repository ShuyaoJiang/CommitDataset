Make the name of the log file produced by launch script configurable

Previously, the launch script would always use a file named
<appname>.log to capture the application's console output. This commit
adds a variable, LOG_FILENAME, for specifying the file name defaulting
to <appname>.log.

Fixes gh-4194
