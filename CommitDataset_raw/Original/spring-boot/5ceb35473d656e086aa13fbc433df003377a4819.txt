Allow multiple readers/writers to be @ActuatorMetric*

In principle you might have multiple "system" repositories, all
of which you want to go to public metrics or not be metrics exporters.
This change adds a new annotation and renames the old one, so that
reades and writers can be distinguished, and also changes the
autowiring of them to accept multiple values.

Also adds automatic public metrics for Spring Integration.
