Honour spring.profiles.include even when .active has not been set

393cfe50 expanded the scope of spring.profiles.include so that it
could be used in any property source, and not just in a configuration
file. However, it did so in such a way that it would only take effect
when used outside of a configuration file if spring.profiles.active
was also set.

This commit updates ConfigFileApplicationListener so that included
profiles are activated when spring.profiles.active has not be set.

Closes gh-8244
