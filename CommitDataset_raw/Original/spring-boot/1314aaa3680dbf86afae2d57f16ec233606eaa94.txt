Avoid early init of CacheManager

This commit restructures the Cache auto-configuration to avoid an early
init on CacheManager (and potentially all its infrastructure). Rather
than adding a dependency on the validator bean, this commit relies on
the fact CacheAspectSupport checks if a CacheManager is available in the
afterSingletonsInstantiated callback. In this case, a simple bean with
a postconstruct callback is enough.

Closes gh-13038
