Ensure `QuartzDatabaseInitializer` is initialized before `Scheduler`

If the auto-configured `Scheduler` instance backed by JDBC job store is
used as a dependency in an application component, the initialization of
`Scheduler` will be triggered before `QuartzDatabaseInitializer`. This
will result in failure due to schema not being prepared in time for
`Scheduler` to populate job details.

This commit ensures `QuartzDatabaseInitializer` is initialized before the
auto-configured `Scheduler` by introducing a dependency between the two.
