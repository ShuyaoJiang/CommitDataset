Store container installs in home directory

Previously, deployment tests were storing the container archives in the
default location (that is `/tmp`) for a total weight of 160MB. In case
the temp directory is cleaned on CI, these have to be downloaded again.

We're now configuring cargo to store these archives in the home directory
instead. This should improve the speed and the stability of the
deployment tests

Closes gh-3861
