Guard Endpoint bean declarations with ConditionalOnExposedEndpoint

This commit adds the newly introduced `@ConditionalOnExposedEndpoint`
conditional annotation to all auto-configured `Endpoint` in Actuator.

With that change, `EndPoint` instances and related infrastructure will
only be created when they are meant to be exposed and used. This will
save CPU and memory resources when Actuator is present.

Closes gh-16093
