Add retry and parameter increment logic to job runner

The existing behaviour of JobLauncherCommandLineRunner was really too
basic. It has now been enhanced (at the expense of duplicating a lot
of code in Spring Batch it seems) to automatically increment job
parameters if it can, and to retry a failed or stopped execution
if it can (without incrementing, but with additional job parameters
added from command line if they are non-identifying).

The JobLauncherCommandLineRunner is more extendable and exposes
its DI wiring points now as well, so hopefully users can make
use of it independently of autoconfig (by providing a @Bean of
that type).

Not everything from the wishlist in gh-325 is implememented yet,
but it should be a good platform to work with and to extend.
