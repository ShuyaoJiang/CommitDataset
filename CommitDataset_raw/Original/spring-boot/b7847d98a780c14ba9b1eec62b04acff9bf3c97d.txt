Auto-configure Neo4J BookmarkManager when possible

Add `Neo4jBookmarkManagementConfiguration` which provides an instance
of `BookmarkManager` if necessary and Caffeine cache is on the
classpath. Depending on the kind of application, the `BookmarkManager`
will be request scoped or singleton, as recommended by Spring Data
Neo4j.
