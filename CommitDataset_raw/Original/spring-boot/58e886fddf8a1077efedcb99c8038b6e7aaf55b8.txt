Remove @Lazy injection for HttpMessageConverters

This commit turns a lazy injection point for `HttpMessageConverters`
into an `ObjectProvider`-backed injection.

This allows to lazily rely on that bean without creating for it; in some
environments, such proxy creation can lead to issues like SPR-16990.
