Ensure ServerProperties default values does not override

Since ServerProperties had primitive properties for port (in
particular) it was not possible to check when applying those
properties if the user had actually changed the value. This
in turn meant that a custom EmbeddedServletContainerFactory
could not set the default values.

Fixed by making int properties of ServerProperties into
Integer and checking for null before setting on the
container factory.

Fixes gh-84
