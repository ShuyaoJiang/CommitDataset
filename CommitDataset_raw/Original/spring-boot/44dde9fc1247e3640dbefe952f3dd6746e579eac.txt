Add deployment integration tests

Add deployment tests for Tomcat, TomEE and WildFly to ensure that
a basic Spring Boot application can be deployed to a traditional
Application server.

Since the deployment tests can be quite slow, they currently only
run in the "full" build profile.

Fixes gh-1736
