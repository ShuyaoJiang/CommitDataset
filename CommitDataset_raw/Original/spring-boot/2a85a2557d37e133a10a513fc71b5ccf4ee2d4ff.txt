Fix health indicator auto-configuration order

Previously, the health auto-configuration `AutoconfigureOrder` entry for
couchbase was referring to the standard couchbase auto-configuration that
is not responsible to configure the `CouchbaseOperations` bean. Yet, the
health indicator implementation was relying on the presence of such a
bean.

This commit fixes the `AutoconfigureOrder` entry so that it refers to
`CouchbaseDataAutoConfiguration` now.

Closes gh-7543
