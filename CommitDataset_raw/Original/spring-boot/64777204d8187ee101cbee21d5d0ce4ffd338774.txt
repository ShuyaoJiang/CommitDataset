Apply codecs auto-configuration to WebFlux

This commit introduces `CodecCustomizer`, a new callback-based interface
for customizing the codecs configuration for WebFlux server and client.

Instances of those customizers are applied to the `WebClient.Builder`
and to the `WebFluxAutoConfiguration` (which deals with both WebFlux and
WebFlux.fn).

For now, only Jackson codecs are auto-configured, by getting the
`ObjectMapper` instance created by Spring Boot. Other codecs can be
configured as soon as WebFlux supports those.

Closes gh-9166
