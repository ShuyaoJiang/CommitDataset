Allow the SpringApplication class used by the CLI to be configured

This commit adds support to the CLI for launching a custom
SpringApplication implementation. The class that is launched can be
configured using the spring.application.class.name System property
or the SPRING_APPLICATION_CLASS_NAME environment variable with the
former taking priority.

Closes gh-2030
