`AutoconfigureTestDatabase` replace with a fresh database

Previously, two or more `@DataJpaTest` tests in the same test suite were
sharing the same in-memory database instance. This commit makes sure
that `TestDatabaseAutoConfiguration` creates a unique embedded database
for each test it operates on.

Closes gh-7473
