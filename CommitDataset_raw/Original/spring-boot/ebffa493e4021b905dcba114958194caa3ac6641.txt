Harmonize ConfigurationProperties bean name

When `@EnableConfigurationProperties` is defined, Spring Boot
automatically registers a bean in the context for each class specified
on the annotation. Previously, the name of the bean only included the
prefix which leads to conflict if two different classes use the same
prefix.

This commit changes the bean name structure to be <prefix>-<fqn> where
prefix is the prefix used on the annotation and <fqn> the fully qualified
name of the target class.

Closes gh-4395
