Use and wait for a latch to check that the interceptor is called

Spring MVC drives the postHandle method on any interceptors after the
response has been sent to the client. This meant that there was a
race between the test receiving the response and asserting that the
interceptor had been driven and Spring MVC driving the interceptor.

This commit updates the interceptor to use a CountDownLatch to track
whether or not it's been called. The test now waits for up to 30
seconds for the latch to be decremented.
