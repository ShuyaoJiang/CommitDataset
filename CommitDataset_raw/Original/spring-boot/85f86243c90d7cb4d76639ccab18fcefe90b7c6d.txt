Order class filter checks and exit early

Update the logic in `OnClassCondition` so that filtering exits on the
first missing class. Also refactor the implementation to save
unnecessary `Set` creation when there is just a single class to check.

The `AutoConfigureAnnotationProcessor` has also been updated to order
classes so that any starting `org.springframework` are considered last.
The assumption being that other classes are more likely to be missing.

Closes gh-12131
