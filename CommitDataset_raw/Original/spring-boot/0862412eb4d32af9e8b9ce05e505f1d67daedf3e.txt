Add filesystem watcher support

Add a filesystem watcher that can be used to inform listeners of
changes (add, delete, modify) to files in specific source folders.

The implementation uses a background thread rather than the WatchService
API to remain compatible with Java 6 and because WatchService is slow on
OSX.
