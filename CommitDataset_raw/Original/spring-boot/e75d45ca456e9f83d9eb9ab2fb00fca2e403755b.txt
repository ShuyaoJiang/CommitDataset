Use empty trust-store password if SSL store provider present

For Tomcat, if an SslStoreProvider is configured,
`SslStoreProviderUrlStreamHandlerFactory` stores the trust-store with an
empty password. Previously, if a password was supplied using the
ssl.trust-store-password property, that would be the password used to
load the trust-store and the connector would warn with "Password
verification failed" message.
