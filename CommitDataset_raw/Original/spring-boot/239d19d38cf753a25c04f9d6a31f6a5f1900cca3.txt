Support JNDI for JTA and JMS.

Update auto-configuration for JMS and JTA to support a ConnectionFactory
and TransactionManager exposed via JNDI.

JTA configuration now attempts a simple JtaTransactionManager before
attempting Bitronix or Atomikos configuration.

The JMS auto-configuration also now attempts to find a ConnectionFactory
from JNDI before falling back to the previous strategies. If JNDI is
present a JndiDestinationResolver is also configured instead of the
default DestinationResolver.
