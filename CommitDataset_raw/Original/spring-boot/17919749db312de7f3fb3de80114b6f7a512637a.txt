Add support for @ResponseStatus in DefaultErrorAttributes

This commit adds support for @ResponseStatus in DefaultErrorAttributes
mimicking the semantics of @ResponseStatus in SpringMVC.

Throwables annotated with @ResponseStatus handled by
DefaultErrorAttributes will result in the following error attributes:
* 'status' set as the return value of the HttpStatus#value()
  defined as @ResponseStatus#value()
* 'error' set to the default reason phrase of the HttpStatus
  defined as @ResponseStatus#value()
* 'message' defined as the value of @ResponseStatus#reason(),
  or the default HttpStatus's reason phrase if left unspecified

See gh-14744
