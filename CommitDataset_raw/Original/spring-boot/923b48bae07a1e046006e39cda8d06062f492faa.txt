Exclude duplicate javax.activation classes from web services starter

In 2.3.1, the JAX-B API now depends on javax.activation-api. This has
caused duplicate Activation classes to appear in the starter due to
dependencies on both javax.activation:activation:1.1 and on
javax.activation:javax.activation-api:1.2. This commit removes the
duplicate classes by excluding the former in favour of the latter.
