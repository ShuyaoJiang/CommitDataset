Drop JarEntryFilters from constructor and methods

Drop JarEntryFilter arguments from the JarFile constructor and the
getNestedJarFile methods. Filtered JarFiles can still be obtained by
using the getFilteredJarFile() method.

This helps simplify the code a little and will make it easier to add
caching.
