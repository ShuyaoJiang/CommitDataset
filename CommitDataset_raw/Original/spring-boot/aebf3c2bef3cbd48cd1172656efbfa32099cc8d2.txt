Tweak external config file loading to support additional profiles

Profiles set with Environment.setActiveProfiles() (rather than
spring.profiles.active) *before* any config files are processed, are
treated as "additional" (to the ones supplied in spring.profiles.active
from all sources, files and System properties included).

Fixes gh-429
