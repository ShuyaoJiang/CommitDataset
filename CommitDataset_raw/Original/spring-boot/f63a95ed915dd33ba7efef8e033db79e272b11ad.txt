Align link configuration with the needs of the Maven Javadoc Plugin

The -link parameters passed into the javadoc executable are used
as-is. For example, redirects are not followed. Unlike 3.x, 2.x of the
Maven javadoc plugin does not attempt to follow redirects before links
are passed to the javadoc executable. As a result, for external links
to work, the links that we provide must be canonical and produce a
200 response when accessed.
