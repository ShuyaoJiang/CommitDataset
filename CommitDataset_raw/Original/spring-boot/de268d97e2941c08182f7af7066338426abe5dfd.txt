Add auto-configuration for reactive Redis

This commit provides an auto-configuration for reactive Redis and a
starter that provides Lettuce as Jedis doesn't support reactive
operations.

There are no support for reactive redis repositories at the moment so
only a `ReactiveRedisTemplate` is auto-configured if necessary.

Closes gh-8053
