ManagementServerConfiguration security

Management endpoints are still secure by default if
Spring Security is present, but now the default
user details have an ADMIN role, and a random password
(which is logged at INFO level if not overridden).

To override you add management.user.password (name, role)
to external properties.

[Fixes #53029715] [bs-203]
