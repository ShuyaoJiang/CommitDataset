Add AggregateMetricReader able to aggregate counters and gauges

Different physical sources for the same logical metric just need to
publish them with a period-separated prefix, and this reader will
aggregate (by truncating the metric names, dropping the prefix).

Very useful (for instance) if multiple application instances are
feeding to a central (e.g. redis) repository and you want to
display the results. Useful in conjunction with a
MetricReaderPublicMetrics for hooking up to the /metrics endpoint.
