Carefully add nested archives from JAR in PropertiesLauncher

If user runs an executable archive then it and its lib directory will be
on the classpath. Entries from loader.path take precedence in a way that
should make sense to users (earlier wins like in CLASSPATH env var).

Also added new integration tests to verify the behaviour (big improvement
on the old ones, which probably aought to be beefed up to the same
standard).

Fixes gh-2314
