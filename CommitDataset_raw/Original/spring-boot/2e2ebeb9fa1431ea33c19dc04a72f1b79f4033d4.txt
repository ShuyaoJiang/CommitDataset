Allow PORTFILE to always override the file to use

Previously, the `PORTFILE` system property was not checked if the
`EmbeddedServerPortFileWriter` was created using the default constructor.

This had the effect to prevent overriding of the port file when this
listener is created without any file or via `META-INF/spring.factories`.

Closes gh-4254
