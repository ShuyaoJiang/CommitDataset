Ensure `JmxEndpoint` beans get context object IDs

Update `EndpointMBeanExporter` to ensure that `JmxEndpoint` as well
as regular `Endpoint` beans are considered when searching the parent
context.

Prior to this commit if the same `JmxEndpoint` was registered in the
both the child and parent context then the `context=` element of the
name wasn't added.

Fixes gh-8152
