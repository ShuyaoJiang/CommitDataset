Align launch.script with the init script spec

The init script spec [1] describes a number of requirements with which
our launch.script did not comply. This commit makes the following
corrections:

 - Add support for force-reload which should be implemented by all
   init scripts
 - Don't fail restart if the service is already stopped or not running
 - Consider stop to be successful if the service is already stopped
 - Exit with 1 if stop fails (indicating a generic or unspecified error)
   rather than 3 (unimplemented feature)
 - Report a status of 1 if app is not running but the pid file exists
 - Report a status of 3 if the app is not running (no pid file)

Closes gh-4231
