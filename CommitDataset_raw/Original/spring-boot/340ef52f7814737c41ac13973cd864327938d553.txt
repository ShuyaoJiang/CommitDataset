Refactor endpoint path concerns

Create a `PathMappedEndpoint` interface that allows any `ExposedEndpoint`
to provide root path details. The `EndpointPathResolver` interface has
been renamed to `PathMapper` and is now only used during endpoint
discovery.

`EndpointPathProvider` has been replaced with `PathMappedEndpoints`
which simply finds relevant path mapped endpoints.

Fixes gh-10985
