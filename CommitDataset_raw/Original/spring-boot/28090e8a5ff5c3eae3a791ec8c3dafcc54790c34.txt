Generate and attach dependency-tree

Update spring-boot-versions to generate a dependency-tree file and
attach it as an artifact. The file is generated by creating a temporary
POM and calling the invoker plugin.

The spring-boot-versions POM now depends on all spring-boot-starter-*
POMs to ensure that they have been installed before the dependency
tree is processes.
