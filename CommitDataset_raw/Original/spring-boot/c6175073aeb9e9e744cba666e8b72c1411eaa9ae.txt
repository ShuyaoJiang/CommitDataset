Be slightly more defensive in DataSource initialization

Adding an Order to the BeanPostProcessor and catching an exception
are enough to get a simple web app with @EnableGlobalMethodSecurity
and JDBC user details running. It actually doesn't solve an underlying
problem in Spring Security, but I'll deal with that separately.
