Add support for unpacking nested JARs

Update the executable JAR code to automatically unpack any entries
which include an entry comment starting `UNPACK:` to the temp folder.
The existing Maven and Gradle plugins have been updated with new
configuration options and the `spring-boot-tools` project has been
updated to write the appropriate entry comment based on a flag passed
in via the `Library` class.

This support has been added to allow libraries such a JRuby (which
assumes that `jruby-complete.jar` is always accessible as file) to work
with Spring Boot executable jars.

Fixes gh-1070
