Fix detection of Autowired constructor with Kotlin

Previously, the import selector wrongly assumed that we should not
use constructor injection with Kotlin. Rather than looking up for the
primary constructor, we retrieve available constructors on the Java
counter-part.

This commit applies the same logic as in the constructor parameter
binder and checks for the primary constructor for Kotlin types.
