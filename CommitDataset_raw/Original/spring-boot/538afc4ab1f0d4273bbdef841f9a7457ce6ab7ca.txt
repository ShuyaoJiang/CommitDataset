Make some methods in BasicErrorController protected

Spring MVC requires all handlers for the same path to be on the same handler
so if anyone wants to add new handlers for different content types they
have to copy a lot of code from BasicErrorController. This change increases
the visibility of the basic utility methods in BasicErrorController so that
custom handlers can be added easily.

Fixes gh-3828
