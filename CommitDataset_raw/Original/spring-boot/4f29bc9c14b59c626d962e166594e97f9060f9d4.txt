Make mvn verify work without install of spring-boot-dependencies

Previously, the custom layout sample could only be built successfully
if spring-boot-dependencies had be installed locally, making its
effective pom available in the local Maven cache.

This commit updates the sample's tests to look at its own pom to
determine the version of Spring Boot that should be used in the
Gradle tests.

Closes gh-8330
