Initiate GitProperties

This commit polish the new info contributor infrastructure by migrating
`GitInfo` to `GitProperties`. `InfoProperties` provides an abstraction
that exposes unstructured data in an immutable way.

The `GitInfoContributor` now accepts a "mode" that determines if all data
should be exposed or only a sub-set of known keys.

Closes gh-2644
