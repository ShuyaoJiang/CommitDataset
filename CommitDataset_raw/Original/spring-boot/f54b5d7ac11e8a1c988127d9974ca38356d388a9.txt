Change ordering of deployment tests to keep Cargo happy

For some reason, Cargo fails when the Tomcat deployment tests are run
after the TomEE deployment tests. It complains that it can’t find one
of its own classes. This commit changes the order so that the TomEE
tests run before the Tomcat tests.
