Update test to align with more precise information about target class

The latest Spring Framework 4.2.2 snapshots have reworked
EventListenerMethodProcessor so that it no longer queries a proxies
target class. Previously, when this was happening, it happened early
in the context's lifecycle when the bean's concrete type was unknown.
The led to the target class being set as the proxied interface.

With the latest 4.2.2 snapshots, the first call to
AopUtils.getTargetClass() happens in the test, by which time the
actual concrete type of the bean is known. This commit updates the
test so that its expectations match the more precise result.
