Provide Reactor 3 auto-configuration

This commit provides auto-configuration for the Reactor Core 3 library.
A new configuration namespace, "spring.reactor" allows to configure
hooks on operators, like "spring.reactor.stacktrace-mode.enabled".

This property is enabled automatically by devtools, since it improves
the developer experience and provides full stacktrace information when
exceptions occur (but at a performance cost).

Fixes gh-7302
