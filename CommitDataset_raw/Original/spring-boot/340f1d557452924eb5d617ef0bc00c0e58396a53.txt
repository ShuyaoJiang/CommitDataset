Add security for Cloud Foundry actuators

Add security to Cloud Foundry actuator endpoints. Security is enforced
by a `HanderInterceptor` on `CloudFoundryEndpointHandlerMapping`. Each
endpoint call expects an 'Authorization' header containing a bearer
token. The token signature is checked against the UAA public keys then
passed to the Cloud Controller to obtain an ultimate access level.

The client may either have 'RESTRICTED' or FULL' access, with the latter
only providing access to a limited set of endpoints.
