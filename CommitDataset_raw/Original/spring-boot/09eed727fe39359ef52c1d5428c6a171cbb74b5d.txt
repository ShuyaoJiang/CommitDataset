Add Spring specific logging configuration support

Update AbstractLoggingSystem to support convention based logging
configuration specifically for Spring applications. Configurations with
the `-spring` suffix will now be loaded automatically (for example
`logback-spring.xml`).

This change allows for custom log configurations without needing to
reinitialize the logging system. When standard configurations are used
there is no way to prevent early initialization.

Fixes gh-2558
