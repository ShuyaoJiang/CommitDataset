Honor outputDirectory properly

Previously, if the repackaged file was different from the main artifact
of the build, the maven plugin wrongly considered that it should attach
the file with a classifier.

The outputDirectory is honored properly now, regardless of the fact a
classifier is defined or not.

Fixes gh-3177
