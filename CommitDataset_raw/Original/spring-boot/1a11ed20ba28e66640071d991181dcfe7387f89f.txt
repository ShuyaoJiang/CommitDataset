Provide a property to configure conversion word used to log exceptions

This commit adds a new property, logging.exception-conversion-word,
that can be used to configure the conversion word that is used when
logging exceptions. The default value, %rEx, will log exceptions
with the root cause first and include class packaging information in
the stack trace. The new property is supported when using either
Logback or Log4J2.

Closes gh-3684
