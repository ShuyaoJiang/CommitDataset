Always handle quoted arguments correctly in the launch script

Previously, arguments passed to the script were handled in one way
if a service was being started using start-stop-daemon and in another
way if start-stop-daemon wasnâ€™t available or the application is being
launched in run mode. This meant that quoted arguments were only 
handled correctly when the application was being started using
start-stop-daemon.

This commit updates the launch script so that argument handling is
the same across all three different way that the application can be
launched.
