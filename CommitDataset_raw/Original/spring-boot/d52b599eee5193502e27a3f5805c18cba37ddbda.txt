Improve Servlet and Filter registration logging

Prior to this commit, the information logged at DEBUG level for the web
infrastructure was not consistent with the experience in Spring
Framework.

This commit moves some logging information about
`ServletContextInitializer` registrations from DEBUG to TRACE level and
gathers the Servlets and Filters registration logs into one-liners at
the DEBUG level.

Closes gh-15166
