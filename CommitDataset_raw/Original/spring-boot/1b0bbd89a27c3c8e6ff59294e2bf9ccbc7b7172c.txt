Reuse ApplicationEventMulticaster

Spring Framework allows a custom `ApplicationEventMulticaster` bean to be
defined with a well-defined bean. If such bean is present, it is used
instead of the default implementation.

This commit fixes `EventPublishingRunListener` to properly honour such
arrangement. Rather than registering a `ApplicationEventMulticaster` to
transmit the application listeners from the `SpringBootApplication` it
now only uses an internal multicaster for early events (i.e. events that
are fired before the context is actually refreshed).

This has the positive effect of making sure that `ApplicationReadyEvent`
is fired to the proper multicaster.

Closes gh-6048
