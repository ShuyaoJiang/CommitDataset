Only access parameters in WebRequestTraceFilter when they are included

Previously, WebRequestTraceFilter would call request.getParameterMap()
before deciding whether or not the parameters should be included in
the trace. For a POST request, this had the unwanted side-effect
of always reading the request body.

This commit updates WebRequestTraceFilter so that it checks that
parameters are to be included in the trace before calling
request.getParameterMap()

Closes gh-5089
