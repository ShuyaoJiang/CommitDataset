Reduce memory consumption of fat/exploded jars

Refactor `spring-boot-loader` to reduce the amount of memory required
to load fat & exploded jars. Jar files now no longer store a full list
of entry data records, but instead use an array of entry name hashes.

Since ClassLoaders often ask each JAR if they contain a particular
entry (and mostly they do not), the hash array provides a quick way to
deal with misses. Only when a hash does exist is data actually loaded
from the underlying file.

In addition to the JarFile changes, the Archive abstraction has also
been updated to reduce memory consumption.
