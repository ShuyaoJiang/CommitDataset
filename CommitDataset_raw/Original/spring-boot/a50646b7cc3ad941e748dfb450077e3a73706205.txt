Fix repackaging of jars with non-default compression configuration

Previously, if a jar that used custom compression configuration was
repackaged, a failure may occur if an entry in the repackaged jar had
a different compressed size to the entry in the source jar.

This commit updates JarWriter to clear the input entry's compressed
size (by setting it to -1) so that the repackaged entry's compressed
size does not have to match that of the input entry.

Closes gh-13720
