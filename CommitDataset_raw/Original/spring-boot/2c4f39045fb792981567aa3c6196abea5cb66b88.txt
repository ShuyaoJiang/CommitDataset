Stop relying on Artemis's on-demand queue creation in CLI JMS test

Artemis's on-demand queue cretaion appears to be rather flakey,
sometimes failing with a NullPointerException.

This commit ensures that the queue used by the sample is created
during start up rather than on demand. This will hopefully make the
test that runs the sample more robust.

Closes gh-7346
