Add @ResponseStatus handler to global exception handler

We might need to revisit this to allow more fine-grained
control by users, but it seems like a sensible default.
The BasicErrorController now uses both of the deafult strategies
(ResponseStatusExceptionResolver and DefaultHandlerExceptionResolver)
from Spring MVC to try and determine an appropriate response.

Fixes gh-839
