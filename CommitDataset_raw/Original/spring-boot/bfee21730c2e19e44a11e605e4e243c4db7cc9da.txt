Detect path of exploded war correctly on Windows

Previously, AbstractEmbeddedServletContainerFactory detected an
exploded war by looking for `/WEB-INF/` in the path of its code
source's location. This failed on Windows due to the use of `\` rather
than `/` separators.

This commit updates AbstractEmbeddedServletContainerFactory to
uses the OS's separator rather than hardcoding `/`.

Closes gh-8100
