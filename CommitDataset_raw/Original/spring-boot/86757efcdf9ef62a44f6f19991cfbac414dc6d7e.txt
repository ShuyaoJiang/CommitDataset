Add FailureAnalyzer for Hikari

Hikari can configure both an underlying Driver or DataSource. Spring Boot
only supports the former so any attempt to trigger the creation of the
latter will lead to an exception since the auto-configuration has set
driver-specific field.

This commit adds an analyzer that intercepts such faulty scenario and
indicate that users should configure Hikari with an underlying DataSource
themselves.

Closes gh-6568
