[bs-93] Add /info endpoint with git properties etc.

* If git.properties is on the classpath (e.g. from the Maven plugin)
/info will list the commit id, branch and dates.
* If application.yml has an info object at the top level that will
be diplayed as well (so e.g. you can use Maven resource filtering
top add the project name, version etc.)
* RelaxedDataBinder can now be used to bind to a Map (as opposed to
a nested Map inside teh target bean)

[Fixes #49130073]
