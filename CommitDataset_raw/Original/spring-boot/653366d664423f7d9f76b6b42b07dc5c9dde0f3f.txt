Remove HikariCP-java6 dependency management

Dependency management for the `HikariCP-java6` dependency is no longer
needed since Java 6 is no longer supported by Spring Boot.

The HikariDriverConfigurationFailureAnalyzer has been updated with the
current message thrown by HikariCP in this failure scenario.

Closes gh-8147
