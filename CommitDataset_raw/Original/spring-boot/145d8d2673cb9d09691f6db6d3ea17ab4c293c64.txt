Defer removal of Connectors until after ServletContext initialization

Previously, we removed the Connectors from Tomcat's Service before
the Context was started. The removal of the Connectors is required as
it prevents Tomcat from accepting requests before we're ready to
handle them.

Part of starting the Context is creating and initializing the
ServletContext. ServerProperties uses a ServletContextInitializer to
set the session tracking modes and Tomcat rejects the SSL tracking
mode if there is no SSL-enabled connector available. With the previous
arrangement this led to a failure as the Connectors had been removed
so the SSL-enabled connector could not be found.

This commit updates the embedded Tomcat container to defer the
removal of the Connectors until after the context has been started
but still at a point that is before the Connectors themselves would
have been started.

Closes gh-12058
