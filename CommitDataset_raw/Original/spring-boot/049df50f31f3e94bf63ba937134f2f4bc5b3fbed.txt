Add explicit dependency to ConnectionFactory auto-configurations

This commit makes sure tht `HealthIndicatorAutoConfiguration` runs after
any producers of a `ConnectionFactory` and not only ActiveMQ. This was
identified as part of #10081: `JmsAutoConfiguration` is actually the
one that isn't necessary (spring-boot-actuator has no import on the
`org.springframework.jms` and only `javax.jms.ConnectionFactory` is used
as part of the JMS health indicator.
