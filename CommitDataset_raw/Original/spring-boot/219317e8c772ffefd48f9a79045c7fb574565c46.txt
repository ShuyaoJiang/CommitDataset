Make web security config require spring-security-web on classpath

Previously, SpringBootWebSecurityConfiguration required a web
application and @EnableWebSecurity to be on the classpath.
@EnableWebSecurity is in spring-security-config so this could lead
to the configuration being active when spring-security-web isn't
on the classpath but the rest of Spring Security is.

This commit updates SpringBootWebSecurityConfiguration to also make it
conditional on a class in spring-security-web.

Fixes gh-2717
