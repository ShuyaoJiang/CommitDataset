Avoid Atmosphere using a null URL to create a URLClassLoader

Unlike Java 8, 9, and 10, Java 11 does not tolerate a null URL being
used to create a URLClassLoader. The Atmosphere sample looks for
a resource named /WEB-INF/classes which only exists in a packaged
war application. In all other cases the resulting URL is null.
Atmosphere uses this to create a URLClassLoader which fails on Java
11.

This commit updates the sample to customize the handlers path. There
are other web application-specific assumptions in Atmosphere, such as
the scanning of WEB-INF/lib by default. This change appears to get
the sample going, but we should, perhaps, consider removing it in the
longer term, particularly as Boot itself has no Atmosphere
integration.
