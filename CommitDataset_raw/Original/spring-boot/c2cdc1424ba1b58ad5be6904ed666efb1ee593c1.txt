Polish documentation

Add an explicit note that states that "spring.datasource.url" (or more
specifically "spring.datasource.class-name" that is inferred from the
former) is necessary to connect to a database. If the class-name isn't
specified, Spring Boot will attempt to auto-configure an embedded
database.

Closes gh-6907
