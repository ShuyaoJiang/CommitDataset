Clarify docs on effect RANDOM_PORT or DEFINED_PORT has on transactions

Previously, when read too quickly, the current note may lead a user to
think that RANDOM_PORT or DEFINED_PORT directly affect transaction
management. This is not the case.

This commit attempts to clarify that the difference in transaction
behaviour is due to transactions being bound to a particular thread
and separate threads being used for the client and server when
tests are making HTTP requests.

Closes gh-9965
