Allow Quartz property to set the scheduler name

This commit makes sure that "org.quartz.scheduler.instanceName" is
honoured if set. Previously, "spring.quartz.scheduler-name" had a
default value and was always set. As a result, `SchedulerFactoryBean`
did not take the quartz property into account.

Closes gh-14243
