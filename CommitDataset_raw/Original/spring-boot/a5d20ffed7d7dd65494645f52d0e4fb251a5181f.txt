Avoid NPE when creating method tag for WebFlux req with non-standard method

Previously, a NullPointerException would occur when WebFluxTags
attempted to create a method Tag for a request with a non-standard
method.

This commit updates WebFluxTags to use getMethodValue(), which will
never return null, rather than getMethod(), which may return null,
when determining the tag's value for the given request.

Closes gh-13596
