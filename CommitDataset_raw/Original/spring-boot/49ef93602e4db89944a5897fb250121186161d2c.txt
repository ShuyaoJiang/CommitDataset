Add external-file-property to LogFileMvcEndpoint

Add an additional property to LogFileMvcEndpoint to allow log files to
be read from an external location. This is helpful when a launch.script
is used to start the boot-application and the logfile is written by a
redirect of stdout/stderr.

Fixes gh-4255
Closes gh-4836
