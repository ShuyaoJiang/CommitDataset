List excluded auto-config classes in the auto-config report and endpoint

Prior to this commit, the auto-configuration report (both in its logged
form and the actuator endpoint) listed the positive and negative matches
but did not list the classes, if any, that the user had excluded.

This commit updates the logged report and the actuator endpoint to
expose a list of the excluded class names configured via the exclude
attribute on @EnableAutoConfiguration.

Closes gh-2085
