Fix ordering of keys in PropertySourcesPropertyValues

Since @ConfigurationProperties binding uses a single instance of
PropertySourcesPropertyValues per bean, there doesn't seem to be
any issue with using a normal LinkedHashMap. Then the order
passed in as PropertySources will be preserved.

Fixes gh-2487
