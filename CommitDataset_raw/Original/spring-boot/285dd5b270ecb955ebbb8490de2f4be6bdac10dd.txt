ApplicationContextInitializers now listen for ContextRefreshedEvent

The AutoConfigurationReportLoggingInitializer wasn't working in
non-GenericApplicationContext becasue teh BeanFatcory wasn't available
for registering its listener during initialization. Instead of
relying on that rather fragile state I decided to give any
ApplicationContextInitializer that was itself an ApplicationListener
an explicit callback with a ContextRefreshedEvent, and move that
interface up a level in the logging initializer. Works much better.
