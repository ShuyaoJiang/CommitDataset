Deprecate excludeArtifactIds

While being able to exclude all artifacts of a given group is a handy
feature, excluding all artifacts with a given artifactId does not make
much sense as it should refer to a single artifact anyway. Also the
general "exclude" mechanism is meant to do the exact same thing.
