Fix secure method configuration global authentication

This fixes a bug in the sample, where the AuthenticationManager it builds
is a local one for the filter chain containing "/login", whereas it was
expecting to override the Boot default, which is "global". The fix is
to extract the authentication configuration out into a
GlobalAuthenticationConfigurerAdapter.

Fixes gh-699
