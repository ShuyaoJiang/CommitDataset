Reduce GC pressure in JAR handler

Update the JAR `Hander` so that URL `startsWith` checks produce less
garbage. Comparisons are now performed first on the `path` rather than
the full `toString`. URL `toString` operations produce quite a lot of
garbage since a `StringBuilder` is always used.

In addition, we now also cache the JarFile URL toString to save repeated
calculation.
