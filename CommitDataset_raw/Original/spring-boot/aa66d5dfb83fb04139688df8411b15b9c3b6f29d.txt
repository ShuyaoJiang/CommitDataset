Reduce garbage created when loading fat jars

Refactor fat jar loader classes so that less `char[]` instances are
created. This is primarily achieved by adding a new `StringSequence`
class that can chop up Strings without needing to copy the underlying
array. Since Java 8, calls to `String.subString(...)` always copy the
underlying char array. For many of the operations that we need, this
is unnecessary.
