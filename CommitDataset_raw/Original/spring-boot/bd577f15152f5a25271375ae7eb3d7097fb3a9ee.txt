Rework Jetty startup so connectors are only started once

Previously the server was started to make the ServletContext
available, then, to prevent requests from being handled before the
application context had been started, the connectors were stopped.
Once application context startup had completed, the connectors were
then started again. In addition to being somewhat inefficient, this
caused problems on FreeBSD where stopping the connector didn't free
up the port quickly enough for the subsequent start to then be able
to bind to it.

This commit updates the Jetty startup logic to be closer to the logic
that's used for Tomcat. Before the server is started, the configured
connectors are cached and then removed. The server is then started
without any connectors. Once application context startup has
completed, the connectors are reinstated and started.

Fixes #968
