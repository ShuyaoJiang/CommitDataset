Support the use of @AliasFor with @PropertyMapping

Previously, when @AliasFor was used, the value of the mapped property
would be incorrect as the value of the canonical attribute would be
used, rather than the value of the alias.

This commit updates AnnotationsPropertySource to use a merged annotation
as the source of attribute values, thereby ensuring that any aliased
attributes are configured correctly.
