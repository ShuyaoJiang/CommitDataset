Fail startup if management server can't start

Update EndpointWebMvcAutoConfiguration to no longer catch and ignore
EmbeddedServletContainerExceptions. Since commit 764e34b9, starting a
management on a different port is not even attempted when running in a
classic servlet container. This means that the catch/log logic (which
was originally added in 45315a97) is no longer necessary, and only
serves to hide genuine problems.

Fixes gh-4064
