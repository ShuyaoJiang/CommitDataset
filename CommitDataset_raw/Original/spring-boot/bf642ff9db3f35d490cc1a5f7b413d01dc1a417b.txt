Continue failure analysis when an analyzer throws an exception

Previously, if a failure analyzer threw an exception from its
analyze method, failure analysis would stop.

This commit updates FailureAnalyzers to catch and log any Throwable
thrown by an analyzer and continue to the next available analyzer.

Closes gh-7956
