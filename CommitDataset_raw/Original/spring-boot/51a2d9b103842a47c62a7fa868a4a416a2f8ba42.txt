Add dep mgmt for fast-classpath-scanner while Neo4j uses LATEST

neo4j-ogm-core uses LATEST for the version of its dependency upon
fast-classpath-scanner. This leads to unrepeatable builds and also
appears to be destabilising our CI.

Hopefull we will be able to revert this commit once
neo4j/neo4j-ogm#341 has been fixed.
