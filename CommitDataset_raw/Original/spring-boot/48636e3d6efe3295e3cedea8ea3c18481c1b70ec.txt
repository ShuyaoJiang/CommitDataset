Add additional grouping of property sources by profile

Before this change the PropertySources loaded from external config
files were just added to the list for resolution in the order that
they were loaded. That worked for simple cases, but when there are
profiles active, and files themselves can activate profiles, it led
to users not being able to change default settings easily (either
on command line or in files, mostly in files).

The solution proposed here is to group PropertySources by profile
and resolve them in order of profile first, and then in order of
the files being loaded.

There are additional shenanigans because the order of the files
being loaded also has to be carefully defined. The rule for users
is that in a list of files to load (e.g. if set via
spring.config.location), the last one wins (natural if you think of
it as a merge of multiple maps). In addition, anything specified
by a user takes precedence over the defaults (which was broken in
some scenarios before).

Additionally, fixes profile ordering in @ConfigurationProperties(path=...)

Fixes gh-483
