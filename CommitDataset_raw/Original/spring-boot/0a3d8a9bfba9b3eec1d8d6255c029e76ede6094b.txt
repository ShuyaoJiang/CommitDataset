Merge branch '1.1.x' and fix failure caused by XML response

Spring 4.1 has added support for XML HTTP message conversion using
Jackson. This was resulting in the response being sent back as XML
rather than JSON. Jackson's XML support doesn't cope well with lists
when it's being asked to deserialize to a Map [1] which is what the
test was doing.

This commit updates the test to indicate that it only accepts
application/json, thereby ensuring that the response can be correctly
deserialized into a Map.

Fixes gh-1715
