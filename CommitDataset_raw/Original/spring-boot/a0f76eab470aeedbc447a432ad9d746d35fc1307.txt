Update JarURLConnection to support jar:file://â€¦ URLs

Previously, JarURLConnection would fail when created with a URL that
began with jar:file:// as the double-slash is not included in jarFile.getUrl().getFile().

This commit updates JarURLConnection to normalise the value return from
url.getFile() to remove a double-slash when present.

Fixes gh-5287
Closes gh-5289
