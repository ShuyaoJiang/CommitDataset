Detect default value from factory method

If a field is initialized via a factory method taking a single argument,
we can relatively safely consider that said argument is a good
representation of its default value. This is typically the case for
Charset or MimeType instances.

We now make sure to detect such use case (i.e. method argument with a
single argument).
