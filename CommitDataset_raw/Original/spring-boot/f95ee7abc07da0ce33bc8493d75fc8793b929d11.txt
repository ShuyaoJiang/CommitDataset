Downgrade Liquibase to 3.0.8

There are some issues with 3.1.1. Performance is one
(according to JIRA https://liquibase.jira.com/browse/CORE-1706),
but the biggest is that there is a package change for the main
ChangeLogHistoryService provider and it's package
(liquibase.channgelog) is not included in the service locator
scan by default. For some reason this only manifests itself
when using the SpringPackageScanClassResolver.

Fixes gh-687
