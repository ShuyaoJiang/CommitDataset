Error handling for WebFlux should log HTTP 5xx errors

This commit ensures that all errors handled by the
`DefaultErrorWebExceptionHandler` (Spring WebFlux error convetion
support) logs an error with request information and exception
stacktrace.

This is limited to errors that result in an HTTP 5xx error.
Exceptions that extend `ResponseStatusException` and set a non-5xx
status will not be logged.

Closes gh-10904
