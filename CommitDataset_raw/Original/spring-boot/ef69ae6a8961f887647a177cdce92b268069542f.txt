Ensure logging filters are removed on cleanup

Update `Log4J2LoggingSystem` and `LogbackLoggingSystem` to ensure
that filters are removed when the `cleanUp` method is called. Prior
to this commit application failures would not remove the filter and
no log messages would appear.

The `LoggingApplicationListener` has also been updated since it
previously failed to handle `ApplicationFailureEvents`.

Finally `EventPublishingRunListener` and `DelegatingApplicationListener`
have been updated to deal with `null` parameters and to cope with
listener errors.

Fixes gh-7758
