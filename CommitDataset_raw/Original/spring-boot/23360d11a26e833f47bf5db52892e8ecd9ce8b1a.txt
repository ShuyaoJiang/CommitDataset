Change codec auto-configuration in HandlerStrategies

Since SPR-15415 and SPR-15435, the HandlerStrategies and its companion
builder are now using the new CodecConfigurer infrastructure to
configure codecs in a cross-cutting way.

This commit looks for a custom instance of `HandlerStrategies.Builder`
provided by the user, or create a default one if none was found.

Fixes gh-8897
