Remove AgentPluginFeatures as they are undocumented

The current implementation is undocumented so it's not clear exactly
what it's intended to do. It also appears to overreach as, for
example, it affects every JavaExec task in a project.

We may need to reinstate something that's somewhat equivalent, but I'd
like to do that armed with more information about the intent of the
functionality and some specific problems that need to be solved.
