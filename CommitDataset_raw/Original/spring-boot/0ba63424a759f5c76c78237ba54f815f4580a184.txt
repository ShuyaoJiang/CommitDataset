Enable "-parameters" compiler flag by default with Maven

This commit upgrades to the `maven-compiler-plugin` 3.6.2 that exposes
an additional property to enable the "-parameters" flag. This flag is
enabled for our own build and any project that uses
`spring-boot-starter-parent` as parent.

Closes gh-9323
