Add an option to log banner rather than printing it to standard out

This commit adds the option to output the banner using the logger
instead of standard out. Rather than taking a boolean
spring.main.show-banner is now configured using an enum. Three values
are supported:

 - LOG: the banner is logged
 - CONSOLE: the banner is printed to standard out (previously true)
 - OFF: the banner is switched off (previously false)

The default behavior remains unchanged; the banner will be printed to
standard out.
