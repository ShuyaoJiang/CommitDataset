Remove need for attached test-jar artifacts

Remove test-jar artifacts from Maven projects and relocate classes. The
majority of utilities now live in the `spring-boot-testsupport` module.

This update will help us to deploy artifacts using the standard Maven
deploy plugin in the future (which doesn't support the filtering of
individual artifacts).

Fixes gh-9493
