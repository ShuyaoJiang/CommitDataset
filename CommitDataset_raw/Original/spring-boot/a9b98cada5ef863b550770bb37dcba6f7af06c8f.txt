Allow loading from package names without dots

Update BeanDefinitionLoader to support loading from package names that
do not contain dots.

Prior to this commit `new BeanDefinitionLoader(registry, "somepackage")`
would fail because "somepackage" exists and is a resource but does not
contain valid XML. Somewhat surprisingly the InputStream returned by
the resource actually contains the listing of files in the package.

Fixes gh-6126
