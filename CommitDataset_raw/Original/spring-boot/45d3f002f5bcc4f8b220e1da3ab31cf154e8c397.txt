Use 'travis_wait' to prevent Travis CI from aborting builds

Builds use the '-q' flag to suppress most output due to a limit of 4MB
of logs on Travis CI. However, Travis will also abort builds that
don't generate any output for 10 minutes. Thus we also use the
'travis_wait' function to make sure builds aren't aborted for up to
30 minutes.
