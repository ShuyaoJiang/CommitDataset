Delay instantiation of DataSource as late as possible

Unfortunately it still has to happen in a @PostConstruct (otherwise
JPA never sees the schema in time), but we can delay a bit by not
using @Autowired. Appears to fix the Spring Cloud problem
(https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-config/issues/105).

Fixes gh-2658
