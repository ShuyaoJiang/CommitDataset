Fix exclude filter to not exclude MediaType

This commit removes MediaType from the list of exclude types as it looks
like an error: MediaType has a constructor taking a `String` and binding
works fine with it.

This has the effect of properly generating the metadata for the only key
that Spring Boot exposes with a MediaType type:
spring.data.rest.default-media-type.

Closes gh-11568
