Simply test for async dispatch metrics filter registration

Previously, the test in MetricsAutoConfigurationIntegrationTests was
testing the functionality of WebMvcMetricsFilter to verify that the
auto-configuration had registered the filter for async dispatches.
This test was complex and covered the same code as a test in
WebMvcMetricsFilterTests.

This commit reworks the test to examine the dispatcher types on the
filter registration directly instead.

Closes gh-11826
