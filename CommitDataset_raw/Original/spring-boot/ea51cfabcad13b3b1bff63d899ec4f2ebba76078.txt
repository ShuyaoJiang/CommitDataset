Avoid uri tag explosion when use of path variable is undetected

Previously, WebMvcTags would fall back to using the request’s path
info if Spring MVC’s best matching path pattern attribute was not
available. For non-Spring MVC web frameworks that support path
variables, such as Jersey, this led to an explosion of URI tags that
could exhaust the heap.
