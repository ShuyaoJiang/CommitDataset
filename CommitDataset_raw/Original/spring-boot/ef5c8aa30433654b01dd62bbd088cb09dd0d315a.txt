[bs-115] Add EmbeddedServletContainerCustomizer as a callback

* All instances are called before the container is started in
 a bean post processor
* Users still have to be careful because the customizer is
called very early in the ApplicationContext lifecycle (e.g.
might have to do a lookup for some dependencies instead of
@Autowired)

[Fixes #49671463] User-hook for customizing embedded servlet container
