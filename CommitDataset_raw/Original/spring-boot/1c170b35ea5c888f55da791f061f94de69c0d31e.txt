Improve handling of connection failures in remote debug tunnel

Previously, if an application had been started without remote
debugging enabled, an attempt to connect to it via
RemoteSpringApplication and the HTTP tunnel would result in the
application being hammered by connection attempts for 30 seconds.

This commit updates the tunnel server to respond with Service
Unavailable (503) when a connection attempt is made and the JVM
does not have remote debugging enabled. When the client receives a
503 response, it now logs a warning message describing the possible
problem before closing the connection.

The client has also been updated to provide improved diagnostics when
a connection to the tunnel server cannot be established, for example
because the remote URL is incorrect, or the remote application isn't
running.

Lastly, the client has been updated so that it continues to accept
connections when a connection to the server is closed. This allows
the user to correct a problem with the remote application, such as
restarting it with remote debugging enabled, without having to also
restart the process that's running RemoteSpringApplication.
