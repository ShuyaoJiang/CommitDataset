Hide 'No log4j2 configuration file found' error

Add a Log4J2 `ConfigurationFactory` that is always applied so that the
"No log4j2 configuration file found" error message does not appear.

Although the message was harmless it was quite annoying to Spring Boot
users who could safely omit the file.

Fixes gh-4809
