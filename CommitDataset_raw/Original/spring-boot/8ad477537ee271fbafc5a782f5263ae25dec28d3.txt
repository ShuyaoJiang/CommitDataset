Fail fast if both uri and client attributes are set

Previously, an URI and individual client attributes can be set to
configure the mongo client. In such a scenario, the URI is ignored.

This commit changes the URI to be "null" and the creation of the client
to fail if both the uri and client attributes are set. If no client
attributes are set, the uri is used as before.

Closes gh-6739
