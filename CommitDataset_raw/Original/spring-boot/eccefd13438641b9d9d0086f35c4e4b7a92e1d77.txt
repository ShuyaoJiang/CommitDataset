Make use of new extensions point in IntegrationComponentScanRegistrar

SI 5 has made IntegrationComponentScanRegistrar more extensible by
offering a method for getting the back packages that can be
overridden.

This commit takes advantage of that change by removing our creation
of "fake" annotation metadata and overriding getBackPackages to return
the auto-configuration packages instead.

Closes gh-7744
