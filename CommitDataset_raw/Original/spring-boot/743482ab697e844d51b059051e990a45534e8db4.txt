Tolerate Gauges with non-Number values

Spring Boot's metrics infrastructure requires a Metric to have a
Number value. Coda Hale's ThreadStatesGaugeSet includes a Gauge
named deadlocks with a Set<String> value (each entry in the set is a
description, including stacktrace, of a deadlocked thread). There's
no obvious way to coerce this to a Number, and there's already a
deadlocks.count metric in the set.

This commit updates MetricRegistryMetricReader to ignore the addition
of any Gauge with a non-Number value.

Fixes gh-2593
