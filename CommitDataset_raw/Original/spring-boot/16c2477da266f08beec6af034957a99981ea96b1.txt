Documentation update

This commit fixes some inconsistent or outdated keys in the
documentation. More specifically:

* allowSessionOverride is no longer a template parameter
* templateEncoding has been renamed to charSet
* Groovy templates do not have the same configuration hierarchy, hence
  they don't share all settings
* spring.data.elasticsearch.local does not seem to exist
* flyway prefix and suffix should be sqlMigrationPrefix and suffix
* spring.rabbitmq.virtualHost had a typo
* endpoints.error.path is not a valid property
* shell.command-path-patterns had a typo
* spring.datasource.max-wait had a typo

Fixes gh-1226
