Set PID system property before *_LOG_PATTERN system properties

Previously, the PID system property was set after the
CONSOLE_LOG_PATTERN and FILE_LOG_PATTERN system properties. This meant
that the values of the pattern system properties could not reference
the PID system property, i.e. ${PID} would not resolve.

This commit sets the PID system property before the *_LOG_PATTERN
system properties, thereby allowing the latter to reference the
former.
