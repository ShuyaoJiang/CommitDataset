Disable Accept-Charset Header in String converter

This commit prevents the `Accept-Charset` from being written by the
StringHttpMessageConverter. This feature is enabled by default in the
framework and writes a *quite long* response header with all charsets
supported by the server.

Closes gh-2370, see gh-1800
