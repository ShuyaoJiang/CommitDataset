Properly discover endpoints that are proxied

Previously to this commit, if a `@ControllerEndpoint`,
`@RestControllerEndpoint` or `@ServletEndpoint` annotated bean was
proxied, the endpoint wasn't properly detected.

This commit makes sure that annotation retrieval works on the user class
while preserving the get (vs. find) retrieval semantic

Closes gh-12441
