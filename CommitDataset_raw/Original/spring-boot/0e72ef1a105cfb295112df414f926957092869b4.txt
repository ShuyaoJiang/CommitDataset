Improve diagnostics for in StarterDependenciesIntegrationTests

The root cause of the build failure something has a null message which
means there's no information available about why the build failed.
Instead of calling fail when a BuildException occurs, this commit
wraps it in a RuntimeException and rethrows it. This should make the
entire chain of exceptions available when a failure occurs.
