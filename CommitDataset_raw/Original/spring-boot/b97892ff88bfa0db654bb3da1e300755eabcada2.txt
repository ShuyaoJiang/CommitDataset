Fix use of deprecated Mongo API

We now use com.mongodb.MongoClientSettings to configure the reactive
MongoDB driver. This is a breaking change as
MongoClientSettingsBuilderCustomizer and user-provided
MongoClientSettings beans referenced the package the settings type
from com.mongodb.async.client.

MongoClient.getSettings() is deprecated and still in use within tests
until a replacement is available.
