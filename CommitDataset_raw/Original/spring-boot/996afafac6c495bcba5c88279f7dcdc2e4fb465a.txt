Optimize OnClassCondition isPresent check

Update `OnClassCondition` to use its own `isPresent` rather than using
`ClassUtils.isPresent`. Using our own implementation saves a few cycles
since we never need to check for native types, and we don't support
nested class references specified in the non `$` notation.
