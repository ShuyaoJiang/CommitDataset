Reduce Lettuce shutdown timeout to 100ms

Reducing the default to 100ms is a good compromise to retain a quiet time
in for parallel execution and optimize for default, single-threaded
execution (such as test execution or regular application shutdown). The
shutdown timeout can be adjusted to fit specific application needs.
