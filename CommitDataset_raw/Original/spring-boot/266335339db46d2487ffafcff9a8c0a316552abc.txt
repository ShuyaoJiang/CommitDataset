Extract BindingResult if necessary

Previously, no `errors` attribute is made available in the standard JSON
error document if a request body object is invalid. This is due to the
fact that the framework throws a `MethodArgumentNotValidException holding
a `BindingResult` object that was not detected.

We now make sure to extract the `BindingResult` from such exception.

Closes gh-4166
