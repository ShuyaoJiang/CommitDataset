Fix caching issues with map property sources

Update `SpringIterableConfigurationPropertySource` so that the cache
key from a `MapPropertySource` is invalidated when the map contents
changes.

Prior to this commit, the actual keys of the map were used as the key.
This meant that if the underlying map changed, they key wouldn't be
invalidated because it ultimately pointed to the same object instance.
