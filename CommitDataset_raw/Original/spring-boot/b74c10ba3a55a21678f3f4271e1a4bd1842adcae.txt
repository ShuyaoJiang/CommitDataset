Document FilterRegistrationBeans specific default

If a filter is registered in `web.xml` with no `dispatcher` element, the
spec states that it should have the `REQUEST` dispatcher type only.

As we are adding more dispatcher types by default, it can be surprising
for users migrating from a `web.xml` based  web app. The documentation
has now an explicit note about this.
