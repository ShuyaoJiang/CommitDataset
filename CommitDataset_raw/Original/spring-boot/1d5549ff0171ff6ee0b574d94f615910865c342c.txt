Merge complex types from multiple source correctly

Update PropertySourcesPropertyValues so that source detection logic for
collection values also considers complex types. Prior to this commit
properties of the following form were processed correctly:

	PropertySource-A
	  list[0]=x

	PropertySource-B
	  list[0]=y
	  list[1]=z

But properties of the form were not:

	PropertySource-A
	  list[0].name=x

	PropertySource-B
	  list[0].name=y
	  list[1].name=z
