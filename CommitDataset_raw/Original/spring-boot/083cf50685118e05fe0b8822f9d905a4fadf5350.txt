Change condition for adding @EnableWebSecurity

Instead of looking for the presence of `WebSecurityConfiguration`,
this commit checks for the presence of a `Filter` with the name
springSecurityFilterChain. This allows users to configure the Filter
without adding `WebSecurityConfiguration`, making it more flexible.
`springSecurityFilterChain` is somewhat of a contract in Spring Security
and it relies on the name being `springSecurityFilterChain`.

Closes gh-10849
