Add opt-in support for registering a shutdown hook to shut down logging

This commit adds a new property, logging.register-shutdown-hook, that
when set to true, will cause LoggingApplicationListener to register
a shutdown hook the first time it initializes a logging system. When
the JVM exits, the shutdown hook shuts down each of the supported
logging systems, ensuring that all of their appenders have been
flushed and closed.

Closes gh-4026
