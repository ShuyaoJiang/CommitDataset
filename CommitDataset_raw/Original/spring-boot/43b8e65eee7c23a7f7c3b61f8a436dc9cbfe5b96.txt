Add dedicated section for `spring.main.banner-mode`

One of the options of the new `banner-mode` property is `off`. YAML maps
`off` to `false` and since we are exposing the method from the
`SpringApplication` public class we can't change the signature to accept
a `String` and do the conversion ourselves.

This commit adds a dedicated section in the guide to warn users about
that particular situation. Adding quotes around the value prevents the
conversion.

Closes gh-4600
