Improve DevTools non-embedded in-memory DB shutdown handling

Shutdown handling has been improved so that it will run after any
EntityManagerFactory beans have been closed. This ensures that Hibernate
can, if configured to do so, drop its schema during restart processing.
Without this change, a benign exception could be logged if the database
was shutdown before Hibernate.

Closes gh-5305
