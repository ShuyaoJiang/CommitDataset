Allow injection of StatsDClient into StatsdMetricWriter

Allow an instance of StatsDClient to be injected into the StatsdMetricWriter
which is used for exporting metrics to a Statsd server. This new constructor
allows the client to be injected but does not change the default behavior of
the writer.
