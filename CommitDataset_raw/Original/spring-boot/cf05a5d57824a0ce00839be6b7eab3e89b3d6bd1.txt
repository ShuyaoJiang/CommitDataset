Fix @Conditional for Batch command line runner

Previously it was @ConditionalOnMissingBean(CommandLineRunner.class)
which caued obvious problems when user wanted to add an unrelated
CLR.

Extended feature set so that a JobRegistry can also be used (with
spring.batch.job.name) and the whole idea can be switched off with
spring.boot.job.enabled.
