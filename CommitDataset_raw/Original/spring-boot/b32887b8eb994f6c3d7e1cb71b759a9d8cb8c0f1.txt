Add support for logging groups

Provide a way for users to quickly group related loggers together for
easier configuration. The `loggers.group` property can be used to define
a group that can then be configured in the usual `loggers.level.<group>`
way.

Additionally, provide pre-defined groups for `web` and `sql.
