Make SpringApplicationConfiguration use SpringApplicationContextLoader

The intention in 1.4 is for the deprecated testing functionality to
behave exactly as it did in 1.3. To help with this, this commit
updates SpringApplicationConfiguration to use
SpringApplicationContextLoader as its loader, just as it did in 1.3.

Closes gh-5882
