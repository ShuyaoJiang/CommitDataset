Add support for DataSize

This commit adds support for Spring Framework's `DataSize` allowing to
express a size in bytes and other convenient units.

Similar to the `Duration` support introduced previously, this commit
adds transparent binding support as well as detection of default values
in `@ConfigurationProperties`-annotated object.

Closes gh-13974
