Add marker interface for non-embedded servlet container

ErrorPageFilter is itself an EmbeddedServletContainerFactory
but it runs in a non-embedded container. Any component that assumes
the presence of an EmbeddedServletContainerFactory implies we are
running embedded is therefore invalid. WebSocketAutoConfiguration
had that problem.

Fixes gh-551
