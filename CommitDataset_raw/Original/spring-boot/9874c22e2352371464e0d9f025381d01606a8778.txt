Fix HAL browser endpoint redirect and entry point with custom servlet path

Previously, the HAL browser endpoint did not consider the dispatcher
servletâ€™s path (server.servlet-path) when redirecting to browser.html
or when updating the API entry point in the served HTML.

This commit moves to using ServletUriComponentsBuilder to build the URI
for the redirect and the path for the entry point. In the interests of
simplicity the logic that sometimes redirected and sometimes forwarded
the request has been changed so that it will always perform a redirect.

Closes gh-6586
