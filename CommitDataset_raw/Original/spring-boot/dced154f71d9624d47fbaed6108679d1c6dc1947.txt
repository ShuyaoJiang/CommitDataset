Fix health endpoint security

Commit b02aba4 has renamed `management.security.role` to
`management.security.roles`. Unfortunately, the `HealthMvcEndpoint`
was still looking at the old property.

This commit makes sure that the proper key is used and any custom
role is applied rather than an unconditional `ADMIN` role.

See gh-6540
