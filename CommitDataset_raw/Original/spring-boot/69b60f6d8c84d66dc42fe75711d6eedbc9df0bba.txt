Remove HalJsonMvcEndpoint’s redirect and add links to both paths instead

Previously, HalJsonMvcEndpoint used a redirect to go from path/ to path.
When the actuator’s configured to use a custom context path this
redirect was leading to an infinite redirect loop.

This commit removes the redirect in favour of updating the controller
advice to apply the links to requests for path and path/.

Closes gh-4853
