Make spring.profiles.include behave consistently

Previously, if profiles were included via a property source with higher
precedence than config files, profiles activated via config files would
not be taken into account. This commit makes spring.profiles.include
behave consistently where it adds to active profiles rather than replacing
them, regardless of property source.

Fixes gh-15344
