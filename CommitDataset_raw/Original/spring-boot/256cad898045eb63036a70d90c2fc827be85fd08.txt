Fix inconsistent synchronization in HttpTunnelServer.ServerThread

Previously, ServerThread.lastHttpRequestTime was written while
synchronized on this.httpConnections but was read without
synchronization. This could lead to a read of the field producing the
wrong value and cause premature connection timeout.

This commit moves the call to checkNotDisconnected into a block that
sychronizes on this.httpConnections, thereby ensuring that
lastHttpRequestTime can be read safely.
