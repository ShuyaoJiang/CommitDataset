Improve DataJpaTest documentation

As `@DataJpaTest` is meta-annotated with `@Transactional`, all data jpa
tests are transactional and rollback at the end of each test. It is
possible to tune that in many ways, including disabling the transaction
per test or per test class.

This commit improves the doc to explain those concepts.

Closes gh-5993
