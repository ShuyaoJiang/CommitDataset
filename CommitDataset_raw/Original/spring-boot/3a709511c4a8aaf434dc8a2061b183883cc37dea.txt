Notify BuildContext of changed build-info file

Update Maven plugin to inform the BuildContext when changes are made to
the `build-info` file. Prior to this commit Eclipse could continually
trigger refreshes whenever "Refresh using native hooks or polling" was
enabled and the file was written to `src/main/resources`.

Closes gh-7741
