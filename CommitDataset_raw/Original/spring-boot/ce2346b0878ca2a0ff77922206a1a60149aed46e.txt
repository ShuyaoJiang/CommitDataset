Reintroduce endpoints.metrics.filter.enabled

Commit 8c14009 removed the endpoints.metrics.filter.enabled property so
that endpoints.metrics.enabled is used for both disabling the endpoint
and the servlet filter that records interactions.

This was an unfortunate decision as it was no longer possible to only
disable the servlet filter. The endpoints.metrics.filter.enabled property
has therefore been restored.

Closes gh-4365
