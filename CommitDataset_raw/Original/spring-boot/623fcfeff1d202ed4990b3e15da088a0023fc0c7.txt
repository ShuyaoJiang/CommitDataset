Properly guard cache statistics providers

Previously, a `NoClassDefFoundError` could be thrown if EhCache or Guava
is on the classpath without `spring-context-support` as the respective
cache statistics provider both needs the implementation and the spring
abstraction implementation.

The `@ConditionalOnClass` definition has been updated to properly guard
those beans.

Closes gh-3960
