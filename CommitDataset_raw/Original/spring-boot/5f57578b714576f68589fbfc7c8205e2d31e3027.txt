Enable APR optional support in Tomcat servers

This commits adds the AprLifecycleListener as a default
LifecycleListener in order to detect and use automatically the
tomcatnative library if it is available, for SSL support.

This feature can be useful for both performance reasons or for
supporting ALPN when using JDK8.

Closes gh-9964
