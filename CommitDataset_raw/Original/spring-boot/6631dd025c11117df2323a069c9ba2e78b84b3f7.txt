Ensure DispatcherServlet is available in a deployed WAR

The DispatcherServletAutoConfiguration had a condition on it that
meant it wasn't used at all if there was no EmbeddedServletContainerFactory.
It's amazing that any WAR ever deployed.

Also added some info logging to servlet and filter registrations.
