Change default order of AutoConfigureOrder to 0

Previously, AutoConfigureOrder defaulted to Ordered.LOWEST_PRECEDENCE.
This made is impossible for an individual auto-configuration to
indicate that it wanted to go "last", i.e. after any
auto-configuration classes that didn't not specify an order, or
specified an order other than LOWEST_PRECEDENCE.

This commit changes to default to 0, allowing a single
 auto-configuration to easily indicate that it should go last.

 Closes gh-10142
