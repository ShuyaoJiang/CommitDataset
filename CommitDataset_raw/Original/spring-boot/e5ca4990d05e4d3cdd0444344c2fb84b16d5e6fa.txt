Fix bootstrap-hosts property detection with list

Previously, if `spring.couchbase.bootstrap-hosts` was specified in YAML
or with the `[Idx]` notation, the auto-configuration would not kick in.

This is due to a limitation of `@ConditionalOnProperty` on a property of
type Collection. This commit workarounds this limitation for now with a
dedicated condition.

Closes gh-7508
