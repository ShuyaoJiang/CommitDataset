Make DevTools DataSource auto-config back off without DataSourceProperties

Previously, if DataSourceAutoConfiguration had been explicitly excluded,
DevToolsDataSourceAutoConfiguration would cause refresh to fail due to
a missing DataSourceProperties bean. This commit corrects the condition
so that the auto-configuration is conditional on a DataSource bean and
a DataSourceProperties bean rather than only being conditional on one or
the other.

Closes gh-5269
