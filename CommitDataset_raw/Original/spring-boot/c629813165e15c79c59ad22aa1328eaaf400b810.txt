Rationalize Spring Data auto-configurations

Relocate several auto-configuration classes to `...autoconfigure.data`
to make it clearer that they are Spring Data specific.

Also moved `EntityManagerFactoryBuilder` to `spring-boot` since it is
generally useful and doesn't need to be directly tied to the
auto-configuration module.

Fixes gh-4002
