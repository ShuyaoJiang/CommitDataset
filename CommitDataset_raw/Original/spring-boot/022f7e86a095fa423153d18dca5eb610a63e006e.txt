Align library file naming mapping

This commit aligns the mapping from library to name to the default
behaviour of the `maven-war-plugin`. Previously, our plugin would use
the full version of the library (i.e. including build timestamp if there
is one), rather than using the `baseVersion` property.

Closes gh-7743
