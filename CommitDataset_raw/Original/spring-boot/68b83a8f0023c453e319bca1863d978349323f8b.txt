Improve handling of loader.path in PropertiesLauncher

Previously, if loader.path directly specified a jar file that contained
nested archives (.zip or .jar), launching would fail unless those
nested archives were uncompressed. However, if loader.path specified a
directory that contained such a jar file the launch would succeed. This
was because the nested archives within the jar were ignored.

This commit updates PropertiesLauncher so that its behaviour in the
scenarios described above is consistent by not looking for archives
nested with a jar thatâ€™s be specified on loader.path. The javadoc for
loader.path has also been updated to make it clear that loader.path
can points to directories or jar files, bringing it into line with
the reference guide.
