Make it easier to use YAML configuration to turn off a logger

A level named off is used to disable logging for a particular logger.
YAML interprets off as false, leading to a failed attempt to get the
LogLevel for FALSE. A workaround is to quote the level, i.e. use "off"
rather than off.

This commit updates LoggingApplicationListener to coerce the string
false back to the level off.
