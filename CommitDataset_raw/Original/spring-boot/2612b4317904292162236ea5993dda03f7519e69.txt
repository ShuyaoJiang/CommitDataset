Restrict maximum URI tags to prevent memory issues

Add MeterFilter to restrict the maximum number of web client URI tags
created. Prior to this commit, if a user was manually building URIs for
use with a RestTemplate (rather than using uriVariables) the JVM could
run out of memory.

Fixes gh-11338
