Allow RouterFunction parameterized with different types

This commit allows *any* type of `RouterFunction` to be injected in the
WebFlux.fn auto-configuration; previously the `RouterFunction<T>` would
restrict injected beans to a single parameterized type.

Doing requires using the `RouterFunction.andOther` method to collect
them.

Fixes gh-9181
