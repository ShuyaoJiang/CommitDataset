Prevent rabbitmq starter to bring webflux on the classpath

This commit excludes `com.rabbitmq:http-client` from `spring-rabbit` as
the former brings spring webflux for an optional feature. This also
prevents Spring Boot to consider that a web server should be started as
all the necessary pieces are unexpectedly present.

Closes gh-12853
