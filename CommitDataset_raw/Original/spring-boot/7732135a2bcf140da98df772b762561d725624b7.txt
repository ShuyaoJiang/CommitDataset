Add repositories section to dependencies POM

Add a repositories section to the spring-boot-dependencies POM but
strip it out during a CI build. This allows snapshot and milestone
BOM imports to be used but doesn't pollute published POMs and doesn't
prevent a fresh checkout from building.

Fixes gh-1413
