Upgrade Gradle plugin’s ID so it’s suitable for the Plugin Portal

Gradle’s plugin portal requires each plugin’s ID to be in a namespace.
Our existing ID, spring-boot, does not meet this requirement. This
commit changes the plugin’s ID to org.springframework.boot.spring-boot.
Note that, as is recommended [1], the plugin’s ID does not include
“gradle”.

See gh-1567
