Remove `@Primary` from `IntegrationMBeanExporter`

Commit 3ea84f9e1 has wrongly introduced a `@Primary` marker on
`IntegrationMBeanExporter` so any use of both Spring's JMX support
and Spring Integration's JMX support leads to an exception. This commit
makes sure to remove the unnecessary `@Primary`

Closes gh-6328
