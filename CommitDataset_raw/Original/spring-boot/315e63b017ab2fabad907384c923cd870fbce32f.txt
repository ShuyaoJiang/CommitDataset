Allow default DevTools properties to be overridden

Previously the default DevTools property source was added in first place
to the environmentâ€™s property sources in an unordered environment
post-processor. This made it difficult to override them.

This commit updates the post-processor to be ordered with lowest
precedence and to add the property source in last place. This should
allow any other property sources and to override the defaults.

Closes gh-3851
