Fix PropertiesConfigAdapter delegation logic

This change replaces fallback logic in PropertiesConfigAdapter and its
descendants such that instead of falling back to default "empty" config
it delegates to superinterface default implementation of the same class.

This allows default implementation to call back to other properties,
like DatadogConfig.uri() does.
