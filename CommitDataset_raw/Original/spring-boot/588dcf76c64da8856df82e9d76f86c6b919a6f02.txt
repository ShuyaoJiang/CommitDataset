Only allow binder recursion with Maps

Refine the binder recursion rules introduced in commit f337323819 so
they only apply to Maps. Recursive List and Array binding is now no
longer allowed. Prior to this commit, binding a List that contained a
reference to itself would fail with a `StackOverflowException` if the
underlying property source was not iterable.

Fixes gh-10702
