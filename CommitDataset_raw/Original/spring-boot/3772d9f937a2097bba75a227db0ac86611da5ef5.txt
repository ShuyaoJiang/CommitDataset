Update JarURLConnection to only require file read permission

Previously, JarURLConnection didn't override getPermission(). This
meant that it required all permissions. This was at odds with the
Oracle JVM's concrete sun.net.www.protocol.jar.JarURLConnection which
overrides getPermission to return a FilePermission with the read
action for the path of the underlying jar.

This commit updates our JarURLConnection to align its behaviour with
sun.net.www.protocol.jar.JarURLConnection.

Closes gh-5411
