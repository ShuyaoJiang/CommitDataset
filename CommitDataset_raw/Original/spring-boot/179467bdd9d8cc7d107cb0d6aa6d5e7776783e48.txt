Make HazelcastJpaDependencyAutoConfiguration public

If Both Hazelcast and Hibernate are available, Spring Boot takes the
opinion that Hazelcast can be used for 2nd level caching and therefore
need to start before Hibernate.

Unfortunately, some users require Hibernate in some of their hazelcast
use case so the link is actually reversed. One way for such user is to
disable the auto-configuration that deals with this link. This class is
now public so that users can locate them and exclude them if necessary.

Closes gh-4960
