Provide TestRestTemplate for @WebIntegrationTests

Add a ContextCustomizerFactory to provide TestRestTemplate as a bean for
tests annotated with WebIntegrationTests. Additionally provide support
for automatically expanding URLs of the form `/example` to
`http://localhost:${local.server.port}/example`.

Fixes gh-5227
