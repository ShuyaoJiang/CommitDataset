Improve error handling in SpringPackageScanClassResolver

Previously, SpringPackageScanResolver was handling as subset of the
failures that Liquibaseâ€™s DefaultPackageScanResolver handles. This could
lead to a failure due to a LinkageError in certain environments.

This commit updates SpringPackageScanClassResolver to align its error
handling with what Liquibase does.

Fixes gh-1853
