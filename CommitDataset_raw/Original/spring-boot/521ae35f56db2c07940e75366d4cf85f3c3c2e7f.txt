Do not set order of ResourceServerConfiguration instances

The need to set the order of ResourceServerConfiguration was
a bad assumption. The value of the order seems strange as well
(-10), and a comment explaining it makes no sense (a resource
server normally wants its filter *after* not *before* the existing
auth server filter). Removing the bean post processor didn't
fail any tests.

In case there are multiple resource servers in the same context
there was also a problem that they ended up with the same order.
