Allow spring.main.sources to override only if uninitialized

The problem this change fixes is that spring.main.sources would always
be bound to SpringApplication.sources when provided in a properties file
even if SpringApplication.run() is called directly with sources. This
led to confusion with users saying that their sources were not working
where in fact they weren't even being used.

There would be more than one way to approach this problem, but we
have chosen for now to ignore spring.main.sources completely
if the SpringApplication constructor was already called with
explicit non-empty sources. It might be preferable, if possible,
to only ignore its value in an external properties file (allowing
command line or System properties to override). If we want to change
the behaviour again, I suggest a new story should be created.
