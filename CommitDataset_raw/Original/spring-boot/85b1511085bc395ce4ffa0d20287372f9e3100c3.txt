Make configuration properties binding always uses current environment

Previously, configuration properties binding would only see changes to
the environment if there was no PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer
in the context. This happened because
PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer wrapped the Environment in a
PropertySource, effectively hiding it from the change tracking
performed by SpringConfigurationPropertySources.

This commit updates ConfigurationPropertiesBindingPostProcessor so
that it ignores the environment property source contained by
PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer and uses a composite of
the PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer's other property sources and
the Environment's PropertySources instead.
