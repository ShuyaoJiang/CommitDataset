Ignore excludeDevtools on extension when it has been set on bootRepackage

Previously, bootRepackage's excludeDevtools property would be
overridden by the springBoot extension's excludeDevtools property.
This prevented devtools from being included by configuring it on the
repackaging task.

This commit corrects the logic so that the setting on the repackaging
task takes priority. It also adds some tests to verify the behaviour.

Closes gh-8308
