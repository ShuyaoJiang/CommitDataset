Make MetricFilter auto-configuration conditional on OncePerRequestFilter

In addition to requiring the Servlet API to be on the classpath,
MetricFilter requires spring-web to also be on the classpath as it
extends OncePerRequestFilter. This commit updates the auto-configuration
for MetricFilter so that it will be disabled in the absence of a 
dependency on spring-web.

Fixes gh-1664
