Remove dead code

ConfigurationPropertiesReportEndpoint parses the meta-data to inspect
entities that have potential cycles in them. The whole logic is based on
the lookup of `META-INF/spring-configuration-metadata.json` files on the
classpath. Unfortunately, the lookup instruction had a typo and did not
retrieve any file.

Surely that code was written with a clear intention in mind but it was
effectively dead code outside tests so it has been removed.

Closes gh-3310
