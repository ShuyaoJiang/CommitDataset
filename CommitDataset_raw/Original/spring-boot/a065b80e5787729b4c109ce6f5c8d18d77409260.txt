Add MetricsEndpointMetricReader for exporting all metrics

User can add a bean of type MetricsEndpointMetricReader to opt in
to exporting all metrics via the MetricsEndpoint (instead of via
MetricReaders). There are disadvantages (like no accurate timestamps)
so it's best to leave it as an opt in.

Also improved tests for metric auto configuration a bit.
