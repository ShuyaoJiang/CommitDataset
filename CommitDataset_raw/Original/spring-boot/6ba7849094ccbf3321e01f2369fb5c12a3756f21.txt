Allow abstract serializers/deserializer in @JsonComponent

Previously JsonComponentModule tried to instantiate all
inner classes and failed with InstantiationException when
the class is abstract and extends JsonSerializer/JsonDeserializer.
With this change is now possible to have common logic inner abstract classes.
