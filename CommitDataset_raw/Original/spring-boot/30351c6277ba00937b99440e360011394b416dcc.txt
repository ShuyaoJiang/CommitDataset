Provide native JtaTransactionManager when applicable

This commit updates JndiJtaConfiguration to provide the same detection
algorithm as <tx:jta-transaction-manager>. If a native JTA transaction
manager exists for the current platform, it is used instead of the regular
JtaTransactionManager implementation.

Fixes gh-1576
