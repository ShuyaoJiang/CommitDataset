Apply logging system properties on reinitialize

Restore Spring Boot 1.3.2 behavior of re-applying system properties
when SLF4J based loggers are re-initialized. Reapplying system
properties is required when using the Spring Cloud config server since
PropertySourceBootstrapConfiguration directly calls the system
initialize method.

Fixes gh-5491
