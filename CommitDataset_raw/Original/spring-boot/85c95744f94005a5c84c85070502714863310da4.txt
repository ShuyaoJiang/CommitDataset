Avoid duplicate script

This commit avoids a script duplication: the integration test runs the
sample instead of a copy of it in the repro directory.

Also switched the sample from ActiveMQ to HornetQ as #323 revealed
some locking on CI. Hopefully that should fix it as HornetQ is non
persistent and can be embedded several times in the same VM.

Fixes gh-1456
