Check for null context when trying to find an exception mapper

If application context refresh fails, SpringApplication will have a 
null context. Previously, this would result in an NPE when looking for
an ExitCodeExceptionMapper.

This commit updates SpringApplication to gracefully handle the context
being null when looking for an ExitCodeExceptionMapper.

Closes gh-4803
