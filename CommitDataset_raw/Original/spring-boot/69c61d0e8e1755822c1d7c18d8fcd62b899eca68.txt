Include transitive file dependencies during Gradle repackaging

Previously, ProjectLibraries only considered a configuration's
direct file dependencies. This meant that a transitive file
dependency that should have been pulled in via a project dependency
was not included in the repackaged jar's lib directory.

ProjectLibraries has been updated to walk down the tree of project
dependencies and create libraries for any file dependencies that
are found.

Fixes gh-1368
