Disable SecurityFilterAutoConfiguration when spring-security-web is missing

Previously, SecurityFilterAutoConfiguration would be created even if
spring-security-web was not on the classpath. This didn't cause a
failure as all of its beans were disabled. It was, however, wasteful,
as the configuration class was processed and a bean created for it
unnecessarily.

This commit makes the whole class conditional on the presence of
spring-security-web so that it will be skipped entirely when the
dependency is not available.

Closes gh-4160
