Fix tests

Some assumptions were being made in tests, e.g. about
there being an AuthenticationManager @Bean, which were
false with the new Security 3.2.1 updates from Rob.

Also parent-child contexts with the actuator were
problematic because they didn't exclude the web configuration
for the management security in the parent context.

Fixes gh-244
