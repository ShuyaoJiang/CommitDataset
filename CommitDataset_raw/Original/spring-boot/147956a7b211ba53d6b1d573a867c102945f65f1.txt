Avoid creating multiple BeanNameViewResolver beans

ErrorMvcAutoConfiguration creates a BeanNameViewResolver bean in case
the user has used @EnabledWebMvc and disabled WebMvcAutoConfiguration.
If the user hasn’t used @EnabledWebMvc, WebMvcAutoConfiguration will
creates its BeanNameViewResolver and override the one that’s already
been defined by ErrorMvcAutoConfiguration.

This commit makes WebMvcAutoConfiguration’s BeanNameViewResolver
definition conditional on there being no existing BeanNameViewResolver
bean definition.
