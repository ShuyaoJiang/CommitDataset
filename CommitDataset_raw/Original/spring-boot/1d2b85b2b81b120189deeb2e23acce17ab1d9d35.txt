Ensure that TestJarFile uses insertion order for jar's entries

Previously, the order of the entries in a TestJarFile was determined
by the underlying file system rather than by the order in which
they were added. This could lead to unpredicatable ordering and
failures in tests that verify archive entry ordering.

This commit updates TestJarFile to add entries to the archive in
insertion order.
