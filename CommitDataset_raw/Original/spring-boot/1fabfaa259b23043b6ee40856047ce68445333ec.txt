Align behaviour of in-memory and redis mult repos

The in-memory version has to force the incoming metric keys to
start with the group name. Redis doesn't have that restriction
but normally we expect both to be used in such a way that
the metric keys already match the prefix. In that case the two
repositories behave the same now in terms of set and get.
