Store ObjectProvider rather than their Streams to allow reuse

Generally speaking, methods on configuration classes will only be called once
and, therefore, it should be safe to hold a reference to a Stream for later
one-time usage. However, there are some scenarios in Spring Fu where functional
registration results in an attempt being made to use a Stream more than use.

This commit protects against multiple use by storing the ObjectProvider and
getting a new ordered Stream each time it's needed.
