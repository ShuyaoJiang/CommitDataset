Fix Spring Batch job restart parameters handling

Fix the `JobLauncherCommandLineRunner` to correctly deal with job
parameters when restarting a job.

Prior to this commit, we were was calling the `getNextJobParameters`
method of the `JobParametersBuilder` from batch. This method was getting
the previous parameters of the wrong job instance in a restart scenario.

This commit fixes the issue by first getting the right job instance with
the provided parameters, then restarting it.

Closes gh-14933
