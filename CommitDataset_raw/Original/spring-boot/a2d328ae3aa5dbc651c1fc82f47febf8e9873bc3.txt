[bs-73] Anonymous classes cannot be used in @Bean definitions in .groovy scripts

* Added a test for each of the classes loaded by the SpringApplication
* If it's an anonymous class or looks like a Groovy closure we ignore it
* The CLI sample job.groovy also modified to take advantage

[Fixes #48718891]
