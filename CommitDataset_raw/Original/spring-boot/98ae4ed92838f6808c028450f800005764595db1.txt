Add ignoreNestedFields option to @ConfigurationProperties

@ConfigurationProperties(ignoreUnkownFields=false,ignoreNestedFields=true)
is now a useful option for binding to "top-level" command line options
(without a prefix). In that case we don't try to bind to `server.*` and
other common prefixed property values (at the cost of not being able to
bind to nested beans).
