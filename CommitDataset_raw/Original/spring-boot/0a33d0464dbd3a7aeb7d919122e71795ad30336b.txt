Respect Boot locations in MockServletContext

Update SpringApplicationContextLoader to use a MockServletContext
subclass which also respects common Spring Boot resource locations. This
allows resources in `/META-INF/resources`, `/resources`, `/public` and
`/static` to be loaded in the same way as those in `/src/main/webapp`.

SpringBootMockServletContext also returns an empty temporary folder for
'/' when no resource locations can be found. This is primarily to
prevent superfluous warnings from Liquibase.

Fixes gh-2654
