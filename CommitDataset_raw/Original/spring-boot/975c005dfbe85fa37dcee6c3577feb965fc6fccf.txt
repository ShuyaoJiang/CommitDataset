Determine Spring Boot version for bom import correctly when using Java 9

In Java 9, a package may return null for its implementation version
even when the manifest attribute specifying the version is present
in the jar from which the package was loaded.

This commit updates DependencyManagementPluginAction to fall back to
accessing the jar and its manifest attributes directly when the
implementation version of its package is null.

Closes gh-10049
