Order WelcomePageHandlerMapping at lower precedence

This commit orders the `WelcomePageHandlerMapping` at
`Ordered.LOWEST_PRECEDENCE -1` in order to give a chance to other
mappings to handle the incoming requests.

In this case, developers might provide a custom `ViewController` or
custom `HandlerMapping` for the `"/"` path and we should not override
that opinion.

Closes gh-12335
