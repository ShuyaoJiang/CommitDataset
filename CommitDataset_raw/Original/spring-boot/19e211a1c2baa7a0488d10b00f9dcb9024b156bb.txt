Add Status endpoint

This commit adds a new `/application/status` endpoint that provides only
the Health's status of an application.

Previously, `/application/health` was returning full health details or
only the status depending on configuration. Those two use cases are now
separate in two endpoints that can be configured, secured and enabled
separately.

Closes gh-9721
