Auto-configure codecs in WebTestClient

This commit applies what's been done in gh-9166 for WebFlux client and
server, but for the `WebTestClient` auto-configuration.

`WebTestClient` can be configured for mock or integration tests and this
change applies `CodecCustomizer` beans to the client being built.

Closes gh-9577
