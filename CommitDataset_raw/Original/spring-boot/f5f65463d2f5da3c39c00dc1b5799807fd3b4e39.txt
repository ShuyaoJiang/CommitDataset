Fail fast on getKeyFromServer() failure

Update `ResourceServerTokenServicesConfiguration` to fail fast if the
`getKeyFromServer()` call fails. Since the key is part of the singleton
`JwtAccessTokenConverter` bean there is not real way to refresh without
restarting the application.

A hard failure seems preferable to an inconsistent state.

Closes gh-8924
