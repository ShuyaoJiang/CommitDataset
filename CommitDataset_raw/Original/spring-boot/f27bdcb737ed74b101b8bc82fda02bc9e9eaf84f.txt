Prevent APT crashes on older Java versions

Update TypeUtils to guard against the use of older Java versions.
Both `Collection` and `Map` type lookups now fallback to generic free
versions of the classes.

Prior to this commit using `xmlbeans-maven-plugin` in combination with
Spring Boot's annotation processor could result in
`IllegalArgumentException: Incorrect number of type arguments`.

Fixes gh-6122
