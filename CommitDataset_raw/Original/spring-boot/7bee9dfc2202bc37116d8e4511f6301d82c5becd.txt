Harmonize HTTP client metrics

This commit harmonizes the auto-configurations for RestTemplate and
WebClient in a single `HttpClientMetricsAutoConfiguration`. Doing so
allows to give a better scope for the shared `MeterFilter`.

As a result`WebClientMetricsAutoConfiguration` has moved to the `client`
package.

Closes gh-14269
