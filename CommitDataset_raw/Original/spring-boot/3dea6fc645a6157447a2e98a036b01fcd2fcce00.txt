Fix bind TypeConverter delegation with collections

Update `BindConverter` so that delegation to `SimpleTypeConverter` also
works with Collections and Arrays.

Prior to this commit, conversion that relied on a `PropertyEditor` would
only work for simple types. For example, "String -> Class<?>" would use
the `ClassEditor` but "String -> List<Class<?>>" would fail.

The `BindConverter` now uses a minimal `ConversionService` as an adapter
to the `SimpleTypeConverter`. This allows us to use the same delimited
string conversion logic as the `ApplicationConverter`.

Fixes gh-12166
