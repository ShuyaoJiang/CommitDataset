Add TransactionTemplate auto-configuration

Provide a TransactionTemplate if one PlatformTransactionManager is
present.

Relocated the jta support as a nested package of the new transaction
package that hosts the transaction template auto-configuration. To avoid
package tangles, links between auto-configurations have been reversed.
