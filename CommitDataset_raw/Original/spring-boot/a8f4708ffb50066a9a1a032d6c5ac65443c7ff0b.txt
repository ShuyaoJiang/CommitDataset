Shut down in-memory database when DevTools restarts the context

Previously an in-memory database that wasn’t pooled (an
EmbeddedDatabase) would be shutdown when the context restarted, but
an in-memory database wrapped in a connection pool was not. This meant
that the former would be be wiped clean after each restart, whereas the
latter would not. In addition to being inconsistent, this also
caused problems with schema.sql and data.sql scripts when using
DevTools. If you were using an in-memory database wrapped in a
connection pool, a failure may occur during a restart as the scripts
were not being run against in clean database.

This commit adds an auto-configured bean to DevTools that, when the
context is being closed, will execute “SHUTDOWN” if it identifies that
the DataSource is not an EmbeddedDatabase and is for an in-memory
database.

Closes gh-4699
