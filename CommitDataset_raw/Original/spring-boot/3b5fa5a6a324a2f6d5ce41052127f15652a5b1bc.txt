Clean server.context-path if necessary

While the doc states that the default value is '/', setting that value
explicitly will lead to an error since we enforce that the default root
is the empty string.

Changing the doc will probably be more confusing than anything else so
we're now cleaning the user's provided value if necessary

Closes gh-3554
