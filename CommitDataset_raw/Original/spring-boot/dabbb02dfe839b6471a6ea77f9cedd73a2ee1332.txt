Prevents tests that use Elasticsearch from polluting the filesystem

By default, Elasticsearch writes it data to ./data. This led to data
being left on the filesystem after a mvn clean which could cause
failures when moving between branches that use different versions of
Elasticsearch.

This commit updates the tests for the Elasticsearch sample and
the Elasticsearch auto-configuration classes to write the
Elasticsearch data and logs into the target directory.
