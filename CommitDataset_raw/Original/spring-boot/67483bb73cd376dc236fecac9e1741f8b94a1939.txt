Only use Converters which are @ConfigurationPropertiesBinder qualified

Users sometimes create beans of type Converter and don't expect that to
automatically trigger a cascade of early initialization. This change adds
a qualifier to the Converters that are used by @ConfigurationProperties,
so they can be isolated (and simple).

Fixes gh-2669
