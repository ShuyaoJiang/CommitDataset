Protect against stack overflow when searching meta annotations

It is legal for an annotation to be annotated with itself. Previously,
when searching for meta annotations this could lead to a stack overflow.
This was likely to occur when using Kotlin as, like Java, its Target
annotation is annotated with itself. A stack overflow doesn’t occur
with Java’s Target annotation due to some short-circuiting logic for
annotations in java.lang.

This commit updates the logic for finding meta-annotations to
short-circuit when an annotation that has already been seen is
encountered.
