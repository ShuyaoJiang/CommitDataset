Always active default build profile

Update the root build POM so that the default profile is always active.
Prior to this commit the profile was to `activeByDefault` which meant
it was only active if no other profiles were enabled. When running in
Eclipse, the `m2e` profile is active, meaning the default profile was
disabled and `spring-javaformat` setting were not applied.

Closes gh-13900
