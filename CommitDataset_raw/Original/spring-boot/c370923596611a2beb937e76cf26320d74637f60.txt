Load profile files that include 'spring.profiles'

Fix ConfigFileApplicationListener to load profile specific files
(*-profile.ext) both as a root document, and again with the profile
active.

This allows profile specific files to still include a 'spring.profiles'
property if they wish.

Issue: gh-340
