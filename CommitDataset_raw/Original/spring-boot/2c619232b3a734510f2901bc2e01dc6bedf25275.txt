Add ComponentScan aliases on SpringBootApplication

Add aliases for `@ComponentScan`attributes on `@SpringBootApplication`
so that it is possible to customize how the component scan should be
applied on the project.

Previously, one would have to revert to `@EnableAutoConfiguration` to
achieve the same result.

Closes gh-3368
