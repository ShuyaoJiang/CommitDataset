Clarify scope of JNDI-based MailSenderAutoConfiguration

This commit separates the auto-configuration of JavaMailSender in two
distinct configuration: one based on existing Session available on JNDI
and the other one based on properties configuration.

This clarifies the auto-configuration report and the fact that the JNDI
variant overrides any Session-related properties that would have been
set in the environment

Closes gh-13026
