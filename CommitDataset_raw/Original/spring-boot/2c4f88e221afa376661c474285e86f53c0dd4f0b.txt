Fix Hazelcast auto-configuration ordering

Make sure that the general Hazelcast auto-configuration is processed
before the cache auto-configuration. This was supposed to be fixed and
tested in 721b5a2 but unfortunately the `@AutoConfigureAfter` annotation
was placed on a regular `@Configuration` class (which has no effect).

The tests were passing because the ordering is actually hardcoded in the
test. The relevant tests now use `ImportAutoConfiguration` that simulates
the same order as the one use by the actual application.

Closes gh-4389
