Replace Starter POM to Starter in the documentation

"Starter POM" is a confusing term as it implies the starter may be a
POM while it's actually a jar artifact like any other dependency. To
reduce the confusion (especially in the way such starter should be
declared in the build), the term Starter POM has been renamed to Starter.
