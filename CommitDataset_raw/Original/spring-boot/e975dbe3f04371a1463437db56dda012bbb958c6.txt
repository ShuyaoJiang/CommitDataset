Only use jar shortcut for matching URLs

Update JAR `Handler` logic so that the existing `jarFile` is only used
if the requested URL starts with the same path. Prior to this commit it
was possible to construct a URL with another URL as context. This could
mean that the `handler` was shared and the already resolved `jarFile`
contained in the handler wasn't necessarily suitable.

Fixes gh-12483
