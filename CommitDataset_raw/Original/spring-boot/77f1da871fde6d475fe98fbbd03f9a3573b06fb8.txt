Add a second, portal-compatible ID to the Gradle plugin

To be compatible with Gradle's plugin portal, plugins must have an
ID that uses a reverse domain name. This means that spring-boot is
not compatible.

This commit introduces a new ID, org.springframework.boot, and
deprecates the old ID.

Closes gh-6997
