Fix Servlet requirements in reference docs

As of Spring Framework 5.0, only Servlet 3.1+ containers are supported.
See https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/Upgrading-to-Spring-Framework-5.x

This commit updates the reference documentation to reflect that and also
removes sections describing pre-Servlet 3.1 solutions, as those are not
supported anymore.

Fixes gh-12370
