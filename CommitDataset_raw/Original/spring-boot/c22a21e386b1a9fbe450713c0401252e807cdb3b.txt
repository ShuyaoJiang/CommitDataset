Add 'contains descendant of' support

Update `ConfigurationPropertySource` with a `containsDescendantOf`
method that can be used to tell if a source contains any descendants
of the given name.

The result is Optional so that sources that cannot determine a result
may return `empty()`.

The existing `IterableConfigurationPropertiesSource` has a default
implementation that works by iterating the contained values. Most other
sources return `empty()` with the exception of the adapted
`RandomProperySource` with will return true for `random.*` names.
