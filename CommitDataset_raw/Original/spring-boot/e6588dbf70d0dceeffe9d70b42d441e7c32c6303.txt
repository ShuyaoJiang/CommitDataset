Make LOGGING_SYSTEM_BEAN_NAME public

Since the `LoggingSystem` may be retrieved very early during the context
initialization, we should do a lookup by name even if only one instance
of that bean is ultimately expected in the context.

The constant defining the bean name is now public to ease that use case.

Closes gh-4584
