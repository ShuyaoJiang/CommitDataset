Merge DriverClassNameProvider in DatabaseDriver

DriverClassNameProvider is unused but was probably restored by a merge
commit at some point. It wasn't obvious and updated that class rather
than `DatabaseDriver`.

This commit updates `DatabaseDriver` and deletes
`DriverClassNameProvider`.

Closes gh-5076
