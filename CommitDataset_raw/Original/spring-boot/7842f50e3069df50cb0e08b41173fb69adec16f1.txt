Add property to skip integration tests

Generalize the `skip` property to start and stop goals so that one
can control if the Spring Boot app is starting via a configuration
property.

Note that this only controls the Spring Boot Maven plugin and the
failsafe maven plugin should be updated accordingly.

Closes gh-4922
