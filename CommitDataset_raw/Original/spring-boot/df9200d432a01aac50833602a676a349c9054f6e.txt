Add JCache API dependency management

The dependency is currently declared in Spring IO Platform from where
it can be removed once it's using a version of Boot that contains
this change. To make the migration of the dependency management from
the Platform to Boot seamless, the dependency is versioned using a
property with the same name as is currently used by the Platform:
javax-cache.version

Closes #1347
