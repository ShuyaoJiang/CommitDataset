Allow to easily customize ListenerContainerFactory

Previously, if one wants to create a custom `JmsListenerContainerFactory`
or `RabbitListenerContainerFactory`, a bunch of code from the auto-
configuration must be duplicated.

This commit introduces two services to configure such factory for JMS
and AMQP with the same sensible defaults that were applied by the
auto-configufrations.

Closes gh-5138
