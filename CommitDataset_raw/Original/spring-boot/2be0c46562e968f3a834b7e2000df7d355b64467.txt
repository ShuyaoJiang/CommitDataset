Remove TestRestTemplate constructors taking template args

As discussed in gh-11872, `TestRestTemplate` constructor variants taking
a `RestTemplate` argument are confusing since the main goal of that
class is to mutate `RestTemplate`.

This commit removes all those constructor variants and replaces them
with `RestTemplateBuilder` arguments when possible.

Closes gh-11872
