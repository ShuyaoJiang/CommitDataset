[bs-144] Make EmbedddedContainerConfiguration an import selector

Previously EmbedddedContainerConfiguration cannot be imported directly.
This change ensures that the nested classes are not loaded automatically
so there can be no issues with the annotation parameters.

There might be a case for a change in Spring here since the framework
itself could just be more cautious when processing nested classes.

[Fixes #50880927]
