Prevent cryptic exception if SecurityProperties not created

Previously if a user happened to provide an @EnableWebSecurity bean
the SecurityProperties would not be created, which is fine until you
add the Actuator (which needs them). Fixed by adding an explicit
SecurityProperties @Bean if not already present.
