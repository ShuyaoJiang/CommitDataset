Speed up grab command test

The autoconfiguration transformations (and loads of grabs
of spring-boot snapshots) were making the grab command
tests run really slowly. Snapshots are particularly bad.

Fixed by adding a --autoconfigure=false option to the
compiler configuration and using it in that test.
