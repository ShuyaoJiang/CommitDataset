Remove hard-coded property values

As of Spring Boot 1.4, IDEs are supposed to provide auto-completion for
hints and enum values. This commit removes the hard-coded copy of
allowed values for enum-based properties. This was mostly the case
already and this commit fixes the few ones remaining.

Closes gh-6654
