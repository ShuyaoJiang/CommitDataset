Fix ScheduledTasksEndpointAutoConfigurationTests

Update the `CustomEndpointConfiguration` class in
`ScheduledTasksEndpointAutoConfigurationTests` to be package private
so that it can be enhanced by cglib.

Prior to merge commit 361437f4 the class was a lite configuration so
it didn't matter that it was a private class.
