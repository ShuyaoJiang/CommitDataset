Load configuration from default profiles if no others active

Before this change if no profile is active yaml documents with
spring.profiles=default were loaded, but they are also loaded
if there *is* an active profile which is more of a problem. In
addition if the user chanes the default profile in the
Environmemt Spring Boot ignore that value ("default" is a magic
String).

After this change:

* If no profile is explicitly active, the default profiles from
the Environment are used explicitly
* The default profiles cause properties to be loaded just like
other profiles, so from YAML documents with spring.profiles and
from files in application-default.properties for instance
* The default profiles are not active when any other profile is
* Properties defined in "top-level" YAML documents with no
specific spring.profiles still act as defaults for *all* profiles

Fixes gh-1219, fixes gh-2623
