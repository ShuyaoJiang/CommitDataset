Reinstate dependency management for hibernate-entitymanager

This commit reinstates dependency management for
hibernate-entitymanager as, while empty, it remains part of Hibernate
5.2.x and people may still have a dependency upon it.

It also reinstates the configuration of skipping the jar during TLD
scanning so that any application that does depend on
hibernate-entitymanager doesn't scan it for TLDs.
