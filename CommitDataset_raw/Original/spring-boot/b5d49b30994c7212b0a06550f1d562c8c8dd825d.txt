Expose additional admin features

Improve SpringApplicationAdminMXBean to expose additional information:

* Whether the application uses an embedded container
* The properties exposed by the `Environment`

This allows to know if the application is web-based and the HTTP port
on which it is running.

Closes gh-3067
