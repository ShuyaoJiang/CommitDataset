Allow early ServletRequest Autowiring

Update `EmbeddedWebApplicationContext` so that Servlet related
resolvable dependencies are registered in `postProcessBeanFactory`.

This allows a `ServletReqest` to be autowired into an early initialized
bean and brings parity with WAR based deployments.

Closes gh-14990
