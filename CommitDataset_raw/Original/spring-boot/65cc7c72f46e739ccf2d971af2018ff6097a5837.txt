Harmonize JNDI lookups to enable resourceRef

This commit makes sure that JMS and Mail JNDI lookups behave the same
way as DataSource JNDI lookups by enabling the "resourceRef" flag.

This will make sure to add "java:comp/env" to the lookup if the JNDI
name doesn't already contain it. If that name does not exist, a second
attempt to the original name will be issued automatically.

Closes gh-12803
