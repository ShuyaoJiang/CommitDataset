[bs-80] Add configurable / switchable web request trace logging (headers etc)

* Added a bean post processor for the Spring Security filter chain
(so you only get traces by default if security is on)
* Every request is logged at trace level if the dump requests flag is
on
* Requests are also dumped to a TraceRepository for later analysis (very
useful for tracing problems in real time when a support call comes in)

[Fixes #48976001]
