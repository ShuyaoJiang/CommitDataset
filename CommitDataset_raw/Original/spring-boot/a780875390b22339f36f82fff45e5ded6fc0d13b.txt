Allow `ApplicationContextRunner` to accept simple bean definitions

This commit adds `withBean` methods to the `ApplicationContextRunner`
abstraction so that simple beans can be registered inline. This is a
nice alternative for cases where a inner configuration class has to be
defined for the purpose of creating a simple bean.

Closes gh-16011
