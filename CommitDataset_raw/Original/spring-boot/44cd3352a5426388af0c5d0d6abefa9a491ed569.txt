Detect jOOQ SQLDialect through jOOQ's JDBCUtils

This change updates SqlDialectLookup to delegate to jOOQ's JDBCUtils
rather than creating an additional mapping between
org.springframework.boot.jdbc.DatabaseDriver and org.jooq.SQLDialect.

This has the following advantages:

1. jOOQ's `SQLDialect` to URL mappings are already maintained by jOOQ,
   so no additional changes will be necessary to Spring Boot in the
   future.
2. Delegating to jOOQ means that the mapping also works for the
   commercial jOOQ distributions, e.g. when working with DB2, Oracle,
   SQL Server, etc., as the JDBCUtils of the commercial distribution
   also contains the relevant logic to map to e.g. `SQLDialect.DB2`,
   `SQLDialect.ORACLE`, `SQLDialect.SQLSERVER` (which are not
   available from the open source distribution linked by Spring Boot
   by default).
