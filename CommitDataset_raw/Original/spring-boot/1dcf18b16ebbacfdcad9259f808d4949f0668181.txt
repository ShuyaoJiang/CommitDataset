Allow Jackson's serialization inclusion to be configured via the env

This commit adds support for configuring an ObjectMapper's
serialization inclusion using the environment via the
spring.jackson.serialization-inclusion property. The property's value
should be one of the values on the JsonInclude.Include enumeration.
Relaxed binding of the property value to the enum is supported. For
example:

spring.jackson.serialization-inclusion: non_null

Closes gh-2532
