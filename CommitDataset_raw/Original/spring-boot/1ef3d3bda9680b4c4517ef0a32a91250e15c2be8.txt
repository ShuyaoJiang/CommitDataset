Fix dependency management failure

All dependencies have recently moved to the spring-boot-dependencies
POM but that POM does not contain the repositories that are required to
download milestone artifacts.

This commit moves the default profile that is active by default at the
right place in the hierarchy so that it is applied there as well.
