Add an integration test to verify filter ordering

We have some requirements for filter ordering:

1. The character encoding filter must go first
2. Spring Session’s filter should go early
3. RequestContextFilter should go late so that it any request wrapping
   performed by other filters is reflected in the request that’s set
   in the RequestContextHolder
4. Spring Security’s Filter must go after RequestContextFilter so that
   any code called by Filters in Spring Security’s Filter chain can
   retrieve the request from RequestContextHolder, for example
   OAuth2ClientContextFilter.
