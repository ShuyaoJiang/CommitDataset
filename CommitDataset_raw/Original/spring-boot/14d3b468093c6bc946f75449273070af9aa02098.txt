Add constants to SecurityProperties and ManagementServerProperties

For the convenience of users who want to selectively override the
access rules in an application without taking complete control of the
security configuration we now have some constants:

* SecurityProperties.ACCESS_OVERRIDE_ORDER for overriding just the
application endpoint access rules

* ManagementServerProperties.ACCESS_OVERRIDE_ORDER for overriding the
application endpoint and management endpoint access rules

Fixes gh-803
