Fix build failure

Commit e26e06d5dd broke the full build as the generated zip file for
the size is not generated. Actually, the site plugin has a jar goal that
is exactly meant for what we need to do.

This commit removes the use of the assembly plugin and invokes the
jar goal of the site plugin when the full profile is enabled.

Relates to #749
