Add @NestedConfigurationProperty meta-data support

Add a @NestedConfigurationProperty annotation which can be used to
customize how configuration mete-data is generated.

Prior to this commit only inner-classes where considered nested
(see Tomcat in ServerProperties). Using this new annotation, the Ssl
property in ServerProperties can be detected as well.
