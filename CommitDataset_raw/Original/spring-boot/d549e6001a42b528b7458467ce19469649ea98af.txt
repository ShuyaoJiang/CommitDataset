Add support for com.mongodb.client.MongoClient

Next to com.mongodb.MongoClient the MongoDB Java driver offers the
com.mongodb.client.MongoClient as entry point for database and
collection operations. Spring Data MongoDB supports
c.m.client.MongoClient via its MongoDbFactory using
SimpleMongoClientDbFactory.

The MongoAutoConfiguration now backs off if any of those two clients is
already defined in the Application context allowing
MongoDataAutoConfiguration to pick up the users driver implementation of
choice.
