Remove Principal handler logic from security

Update ManagementSecurityAutoConfiguration so that MVC Endpoints that
have Principal arguments are not treated in any special way. This
restores Spring Boot 1.1.x behavior where the 'sensitive' flag is used
to determine access rules.

The HealthMvcEndpoint still uses the Principal (when available) to
determine if full status information can be displayed. It now also
explicitly checks the environment for `endpoints.health.sensitive`
to determine if the user has opted-out and requires complete health
details.

The health MVC endpoint should now work as follows:

* Default configuration - No login is required, full information is only
  displayed if a Principal is available.
* endpoints.health.sensitive=true - Login is required, full information
  is displayed.
* endpoints.health.sensitive=false - Login is not required, full
  information is displayed.

Fixes gh-2211
