Allow XA DataSource and ConnFactory pools to be configured via the env

This commit adds support for configuring the XA DataSource and
ConnectionFactory pools created by Atomikos and Bitronix via the
environment. The property prefixes vary depending on the transaction
manager thatâ€™s in use. They are:

Bitronix:
 - spring.jta.bitronix.datasource
 - spring.jta.bitronix.connectionfactory

Atomikos:
 - spring.jta.atomikos.datasource
 - spring.jta.atomikos.connectionfactory

The configuration processor has been updated to ignore
javax.jms.XAConnectionFactory and javax.sql.XADataSource as neither of
these types can be created via property binding.
