Auto-configure MockMvc with Spring Security

When Spring Security and its spring-security-test module are on the
classpath, `@WebMvcTest` will now auto-configure Spring Security and
configure its MockMvc-based test support. This behaviour can be
disabled using the new secure attribute on `@WebMvcTest` and
`@AutoConfigureMockMvc`.

Closes gh-5476
