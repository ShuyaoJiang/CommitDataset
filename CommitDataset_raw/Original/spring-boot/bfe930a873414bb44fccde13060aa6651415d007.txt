Auto-configure @EnableConfigurationProperties

Add an auto-configuration that avoid a Spring Boot user to add
`@EnableConfigurationProperties` to its configuration to benefit from
that feature.

As our own auto-configurations are tested independently, such annotation
is still present to avoid a useless reference to this new
auto-configuration.

Closes gh-2457
