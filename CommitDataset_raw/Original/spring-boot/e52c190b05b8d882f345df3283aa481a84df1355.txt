Narrow String properties to a more precise type

We envision that IDE will support auto-completion for known types in the
future, for instance Charset, MimeType, Resource and Locale. Some of our
own configuration keys use a raw String type whereas they actually
represent a higher-level concept.

We now make sure to expose these with a better type, if applicable.
