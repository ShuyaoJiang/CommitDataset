Add ErrorWrapperEmbeddedServletContainerFactory for error pages in WARs

Error pages are a feature of the servlet spec but there is no Java API for
registering them in the spec. This filter works around that by accepting error page
registrations from Spring Boot's EmbeddedServletContainerCustomizer (any beans
of that type in the context will be applied to this container).

In addition the ErrorController interface was enhanced to provide callers
the option to suppress logging.

Fixes gh-410
