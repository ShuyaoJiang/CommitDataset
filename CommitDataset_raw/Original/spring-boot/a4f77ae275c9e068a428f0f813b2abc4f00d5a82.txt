Provide dependency management for com.fasterxml:classmate

Hibernate and Hibernate Validator depend on different versions of
Classmate (1.1 and 1.3 respectively). This can lead to build failures
when Maven's Enforcer plugin is used.

This commit adds dependency management for Classmate which ensures
that a consistent version is used and convergence errors are avoided.

Closes gh-5697
