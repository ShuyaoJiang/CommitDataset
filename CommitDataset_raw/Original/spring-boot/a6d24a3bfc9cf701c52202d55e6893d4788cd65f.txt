Allow bootWar to package webapp resources in dirs that overlap loader

Previously, the presence of a src/main/webapp/org directory would
cause the execution of BootWar to fail due to an attempt to write
a duplicate org/ entry to the zip output stream.

This commit updates BootZipCopyAction so that FileTreeElements that
match a directory entry created while writing the loader classes are
skipped.

Closes gh-8972
