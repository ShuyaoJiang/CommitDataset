[bs-135] Plugin model for spring commands

* Added CommandFactory and a ServiceLoader model for providing
implementations
* Added ScriptCommand (wrapping groovy script). Service providers
are recommended to implement OptionHandler in their script, but a
regulare Script or a Runnable will also work.
