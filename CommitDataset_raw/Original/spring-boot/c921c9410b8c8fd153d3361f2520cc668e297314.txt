Improve startup failure diagnostics

A typical cause of startup failure is an incorrectly configured
classpath. Previously the classpath used to launch the application
wasn't easy for a user to discover. This made problem diagnosis
difficult. This commit adds an application listener that, in the event
of a start error, logs the thread context class loader's classpath at
INFO level. The classpath is also logged at DEBUG level when an
application starts successfully.
