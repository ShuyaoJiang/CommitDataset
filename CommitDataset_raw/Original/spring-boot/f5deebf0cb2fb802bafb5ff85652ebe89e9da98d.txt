Support authorization_code grant for OAuth2 client

This commit also refactors OAuth2 client properties. With
the added support for authorization_code clients, client
registrations are now divided into `login` and `authorization_code`.
An environment post processor is used for backward compatibility with
old Open ID Connect login clients.

Closes gh-13812
