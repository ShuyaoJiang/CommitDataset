Add support for Spring WS auto WSDL/XSD exposure

This commit adds support for auto-configuration of Spring WS automatic
WSDL and XSD exposure i.e. registration of `WsdlDefinition` and
`XsdDefinition` beans. The bean registration is triggered by configuring
`spring.webservices.wsdl-locations` property which will search the
provided locations for WSDL/XSD files and register appropriate beans.
