Copy conversion service when performing environment conversion

Previously, when a web environment was converted to a
StandardEnvironment, any customizations of the source environment's
ConversionService were lost.

This commit updates the logic that performs the conversion to copy
the source's ConversionService to the converted environment, thereby
ensuring that any customizations are retained.
