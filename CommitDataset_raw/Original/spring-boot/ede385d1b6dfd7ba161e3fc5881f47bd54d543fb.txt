Modify @Condition for detecting existing message bundle resource

The problem with the old code is that it worces a ResourceBundle to
initialize with the default encoding (and that is then cached in the
JDK) during @Condition evaluation (so before the encoding is known).

Includes test for swedish messages

Fixes gh-1228
