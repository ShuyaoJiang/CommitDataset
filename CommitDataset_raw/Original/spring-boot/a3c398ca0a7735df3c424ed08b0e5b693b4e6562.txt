Add --HEAD support to Homebrew formula

This change adds support for --HEAD builds to the Homebrew formula. It
defines a conditional dependency on Maven and builds the -cli project
during install.  The location to install from is abstracted out so
that code is identical regardless of whether the build is --HEAD or
mainline.
