Fully honour local repository location configured in settings.xml

Previously, DefaultRepositorySystemSessionAutoConfiguration would
read the local repository configuration from settings.xml, but did
not perform any property interpolation. This would leave placeholders
such as ${user.home} as-is and result in the use of the wrong
location. To address this, the code that reads settings.xml has been
updated to provide the current System properties as a property
interpolation source.

RepositoryConfigurationFactory configures the local repository as a
"remote" repository when the local repository location has been
overridden. This allows spring grab to copy dependencies from the
local repository into the grab output location (configured via the
grape.root system property) rather than having to download them again.
This logic did not consider the customization of the local repository
location via settings.xml so the dependencies would be downloaded again.
To address this, RepositoryConfigurationFactory has been updated to
attempt to use the location configured in settings.xml, before falling
back to the default location.

The logic that reads settings.xml has deliberately been duplicated. It
could have been extracted into a separate class, but this is only a
temporary measure until gh-3275 is tackled. Duplication was deemed
preferable to adding a new public class in 1.2.x that weâ€™d then want to
remove in 1.3.

Closes gh-3274
