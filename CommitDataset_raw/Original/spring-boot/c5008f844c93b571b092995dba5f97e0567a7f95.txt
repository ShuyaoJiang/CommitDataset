Make sure bean resolver is set in the OAuth2 expression evaluator

Also copies the ExpressionParser (the only public getter), trust
resolver and permission evaluator (if available in the context). Changes
the logic to not replace an existing OAuth2MethodSecurityExpressionHandler
so that users can override simply by providing a bean of that type.

Fixes gh-3542
