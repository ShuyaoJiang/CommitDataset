Stop error page filter from commiting response prematurely

Previously, the error page filter used sendError to set the response
status when handling an exception and before forwarding the request
to the error controller. Following the fix for gh-11814, this meant
that the error controller was unable to write its response and the
containers default error page was returned instead.

This commit updates the error page filter to use setStatus rather than
sendError. This ensures that the response has the correct status code
while allowing the error controller to write its body. Tests have
been added to the Tomcat deployment test suite to verify that the
error page filter behaves as intended when dealing with a sent error
and an exception for requests accepting HTML, JSON, or anything.

Closes gh-12787
