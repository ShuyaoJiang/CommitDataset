Polish ConfigurationPropertySource support

Improve ConfigurationPropertySource support by reworking some of the
stream calls based on advice offered by Tagir Valeev from JetBrains.

Also improved ConfigurationPropertySource.containsDescendantOf so that
it returns an enum rather than an Optional<Boolean> (again based on
feedback from Tagir).
