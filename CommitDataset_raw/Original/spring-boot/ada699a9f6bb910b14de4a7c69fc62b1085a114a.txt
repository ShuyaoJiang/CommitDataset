Allow to customize the RabbitMQ RetryTemplate

This commit adds the ability to customize the RetryTemplate used in the
RabbitMQ infrastructure. The customizer is slightly unusual and offer
a `Target` enum that define the component that will use the retry
template: `SENDER` for the auto-configured `RabbitTemplate` and
`LISTENER` for a listener container created by a
`RabbitListenerContainerFactoryConfigurer`.

Closes gh-13793
