Make sure that JpaProperties does not have Hibernate imports

This commit removes Hibernate imports from JpaProperties so that it can
be used with another JPA provider.

This commit is a breaking change for an internal, yet public class used
to transmit customizations provided by the user. It does not change the
external functionality though: naming strategies defined as bean are
still taken into account and a customizer has a chance to override it
regardless.

Closes gh-13043
