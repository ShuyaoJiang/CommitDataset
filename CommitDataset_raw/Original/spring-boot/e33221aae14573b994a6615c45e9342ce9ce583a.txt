Configure existing Jersey servlet registration created by the SCI

When a Jersey app is deployed to a standalone container, Jersey’s
ServletContainerInitializer will run and register a servlet for a class
annotated with @ApplicationPath. If Jersey’s ServletContainerInitializer
runs before Spring’s, this servlet will take precedence over the
servlet registered by JerseyAutoConfiguration and will therefore not be
configured with any init parameters specified using spring.jersey.init

For the case where Jersey’s SCI runs first, this commit updates
JerseyAutoConfiguration to examine the servlet context for an existing
registration of Jersey’s servlet (Jersey names the registration using
the fully-qualified name of the ResourceConfig subclass). If a
registration is found its init parameters are configured using the
configuration provided by spring.jersey.init.

For the case where Spring’s SCI runs first, this commit updates
JerseyAutoConfiguration so that it names its registration using the
fully-qualified name of the ResourceConfig sub-class. This allows
Jersey’s SCI to find the existing registration rather than attempting
to configure its own.

Closes gh-2471
