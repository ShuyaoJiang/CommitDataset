Don't render error view if response is committed

This commit prevents the default error view from rendering itself if the
response has been committed already. In this case, it is impossible to
change the HTTP response status and write a proper response - trying to
do so often results in a `IllegalStateException` since the response body
has already been written to.

Fixes gh-11580
