Align servlet container error handling with executable jar/war behavior

Previously, when an exception was thrown by a Controller in an
application deployed to a servlet container the exception that was
handled would be Spring Framework’s NestedServletException rather than
the exception thrown by the application. Furthermore, when an exception
was thrown or the response was used to send an error, the
javax.servlet.error.request_uri request attribute would not be set. This
differed from the behaviour in an executable jar/war where the exception
would be the one thrown by the application, and the request_uri
attribute would be set.

This commit updates ErrorPageFilter, which is only involved in a servlet
container, to unwrap a NestedServletException so that it’s the
application’s exception that’s handled, and to set the request_uri
attribute in the event of an exception being thrown or an error being
sent.
