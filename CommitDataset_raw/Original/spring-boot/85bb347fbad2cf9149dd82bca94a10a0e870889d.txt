Add eclipse specific profile to set execution env

Update the parent POM to include a new profile which is automatically
enabled by eclipse.

The profile duplicates `default` and also set the compiler version to
1.8. This means that M2E sets the execution environment to `JavaSE-1.8`
but the command line build still compiles 1.6 compatible code.

Fixes gh-3618
