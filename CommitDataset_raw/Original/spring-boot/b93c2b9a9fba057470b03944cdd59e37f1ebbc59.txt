Allow actuator endpoints to be used with mvcMatchers

This commit changes AbstractWebMvcEndpointHandlerMapping to
be a MatchableHandlerMapping. Additionally, EndpointRequest,
now delegates to MvcRequestMatcher for Spring MVC applications.

For all other applications, AntPathRequestMatcher is used as
a delegate.

Closes gh-13962
