Support Jetty 9.4 and upgrade to 9.4.0.v20161208

Update `JettyEmbeddedServletContainerFactory` to support Jetty 9.4
directly and Jetty 9.3 via reflection. The primary difference between
Jetty 9.3 and 9.4 are the session management classes. Websocket suppport
has also been updates, but this is handled transparently by the
Spring Framework support.

Fixes gh-7599
