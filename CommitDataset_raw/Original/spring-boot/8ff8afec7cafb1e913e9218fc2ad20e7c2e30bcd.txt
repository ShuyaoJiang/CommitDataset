Add "handle-as" hint provider

Replace the enum provider by a more general purpose provider that can
substitute the type of the property for the purpose of auto-completing
the values.

"handle-as" can be used for enums but for any type that the IDE
understands such as locale, charset, mime-type and Spring's resource
abstraction.
