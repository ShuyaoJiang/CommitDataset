Add check for non empty list of factories

It was seeen that if a different plugin was used to package Spring Boot
that the project would load but no autoconfiguration actually took
place and many features were mysteriously not working.  Adding a check
to ensure that some factories are always loaded as this is expected.

Closes gh-5465
