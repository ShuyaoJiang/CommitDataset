Add default value for arrays

Previously, a property holding an array did not have a proper default
value in the meta-data even though the related field was initialized
properly.

An explicit support for arrays has been added. The "defaultValue" now
holds the default value for singular properties or an array of values for
array-based properties. If the value is initalized with an empty array,
the default value is an empty array as well.

Closes gh-1996
