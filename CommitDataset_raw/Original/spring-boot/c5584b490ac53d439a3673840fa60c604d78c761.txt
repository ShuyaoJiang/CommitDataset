Add some more smarts around --debug

--verbose seems to be only for CLI logging (so really only
for dependency resolution). --debug is interpreted by SpringApplication
but up to now has been extracted and deleted from the command line
by the CommandRunner. This change makes --debug set a System property
*and* pass it down to the application (if used with -- separator).

Fixes gh-266
