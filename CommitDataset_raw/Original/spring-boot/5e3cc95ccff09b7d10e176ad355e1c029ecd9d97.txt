Adjust security.basic.enabled=false behaviour

Actually the web-secure sample is misusing
security.basic.enabled=false (IMO) - it should be a flag
to say that you want to temporarily disable the basic security
fallback on application endpoins, not  way to disable all
security autoconfiguration.

Added test case to web-secure sample to ensure a user
can log in.

Fixes gh-979
