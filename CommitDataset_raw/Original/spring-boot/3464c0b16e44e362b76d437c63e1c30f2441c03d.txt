Ensure that Hypermedia-related auto-config works without Jackson

Previously, both HypermediaAutoConfiguration and HttpMessageConverters
assumed that if Spring HATEOAS was on the class path, then Jackson
would be too. When this was not the case, an application would fail
to start.

This commit updates both classes to back off appropriately when
Spring HATEOAS is on the classpath but Jackson is not.

Closes gh-7434
