Docs and actuator endpoints can be enabled when endpoints.enabled=false

Previously, if endpoints.enabled was false setting
endpoints.docs.enabled=true or endpoints.actuator.enabled=true would
have no effect as their entire configuration class was conditional
on endpoints.enabled being true.

This commit updates the conditions on the configuration class so that
it is conditional on either the actuator or docs endpoint being enabled.

Closes gh-5007
