Fix HornetQ ClassNotFound issues when not embedded

Update HornetQConnectionFactoryConfiguration and
HornetQXAConnectionFactoryConfiguration so that they no longer depend
on the HornetQ EmbeddedJMS class. EmbeddedJMS beans are started
(when possible) from the HornetQConnectionFactoryFactory.

Fixes gh-1480
