Add maven plugin documentation

This commit adds the generated site for the maven plugin alongside
the developer guide and javadoc. The maven plugin is available in
the "/maven-plugin" context.

The advanced information described in the developer guide have
been migrated to the plugin site as most the information is taken
from the code itself, which avoids duplication.

Fixes #749
