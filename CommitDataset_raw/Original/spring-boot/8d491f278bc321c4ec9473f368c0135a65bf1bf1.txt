Create FilePermission lazily in JarURLConnection

JarURLConnection is very performance sensitive. The change in 3772d9f
meant that every JarURLConnection would create a FilePermission,
irrespective of whether it was actually used.

This commit updates JarURLConnection to create its FilePermission
lazily. When there is no security manager a permission will no longer
be created at all.

Closes gh-5411
