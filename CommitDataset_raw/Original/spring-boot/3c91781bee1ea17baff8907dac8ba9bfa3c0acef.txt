Add additional exclude property

The default value of `spring.devtools.restart.exclude` is quite long and
any override requires to copy/paste it to add additional exclusions. To
avoid that, a new `spring.devtools.restart.additional-exclude` property
has been added.

Both properties are now used to compute the full list of exclusions that
is used by PatternClassPathRestartStrategy.

Closes gh-3774
