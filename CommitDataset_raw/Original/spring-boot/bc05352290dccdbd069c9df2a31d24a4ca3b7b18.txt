Improve new metrics endpoint

- New repeatable tag query parameter to refine a query by one or more
  tag key/value pairs.
- Selecting a metric by name (and optionally a set of tags) reports
  statistics that are the sum of the statistics on all time series
  containing the name (and tags).

Closes gh-10524
