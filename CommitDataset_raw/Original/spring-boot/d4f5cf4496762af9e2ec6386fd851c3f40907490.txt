Filter non 'jar' types from nested libs

Update the `ArtifactsLibraries` used by the maven plugin to filter
based on artifact types. This prevent `.pom` files from accidentally
being packaged in `/libs` and ultimately resulting in 'Unable to find
ZIP central directory records' errors.

Fixes gh-324
