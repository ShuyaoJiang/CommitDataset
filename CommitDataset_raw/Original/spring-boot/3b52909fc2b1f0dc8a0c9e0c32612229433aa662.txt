Don't change ownership of PID_FOLDER

Update the launch script so that it no longer changes ownership of the
PID_FOLDER.

Commit b24e736cfed77be5902f30b79548f051e91d56c9 had changed the chown
line from:
	chown "$run_user" "$PID_FOLDER/${identity}"
to:
	chown "$run_user" "$PID_FOLDER"

This meant that it was possible for the launch script to change
ownership of `/var/run` and prevent later processes from writing to
the folder.

Since PID_FOLDER is created before the chown statement, and that
the `checkPermissions` function runs to ensure that the PID file can
be written, it appears that the chown is not even required.

Fixes gh-6532
