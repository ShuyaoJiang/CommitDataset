Create @ManagementContextConfiguration annotation

Replace the previously used `EndpointWebMvcConfiguration`
`spring.factories` key with a dedicated ManagementContextConfiguration
annotation.

Also renamed the EndpointWebMvcHypermediaConfiguration and
EndpointWebMvcConfiguration classes to make it clearer that they are
for the management context.
