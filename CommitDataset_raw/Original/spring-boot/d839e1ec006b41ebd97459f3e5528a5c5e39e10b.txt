Remove redundant restart-compatible Redis serializer

Previously, Spring Data Redis assumed that the class loader that loaded
its classes would also be able to load the application’s classes. This
assumption is faulty when there are multiple class loaders involved
such as when using dev tools or when Spring Data Redis is installed as
a shared library in a servlet container.

DATAREDIS-427 and DATAREDIS-501 removed this assumption by making the
default serialiser use the bean class loader. DevTools configures this
class loader to be the restart class loader which can load the
application’s classes. As a result of moving to Hopper SR2 snapshots,
these fixes are now available and we can remove our custom serialised.
