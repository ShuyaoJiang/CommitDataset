Prevent Undertow from exposing classpath files

Update `UndertowEmbeddedServletContainerFactory` so that the
`ClassPathResourceManager` is no longer registered by default.

Prior to this commit the resource manager would be registered whenever
a valid document root could not be found. This had the effect of
exposing all classpath files.

Fixes gh-4015
