Check for existence of ResourceBundle before creating MessageSource

Irritatingly a ResourceBundleMessageSource never gives up trying to
create a resource bundle for every message resolution, so to stop
it logging all those warnings (and probably sucking performance-wise)
we need to disable the MessageSource if a bundle is not provided.

Fixes gh-1019
