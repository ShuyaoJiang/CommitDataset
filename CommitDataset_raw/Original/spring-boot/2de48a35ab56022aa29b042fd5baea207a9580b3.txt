Make /error the error page in child context as well as parent

If user set the management.port *and* the management.context-path
then the /error path was in the wrong place because formerly it
was implemented (in this case) by an MvcEndpoint. If we
switch it to a regular @Controller (which are now supported in the
child context if there is one) then it won't disappear under the
management.context-path.

Also use lazy request matching in ignores as well as secure paths.
The problem was that the ignores were constructed eagerly from the
actuator paths before they were available (the EndpointHandlerMapping
needs to be lazily accessed to avoid a security-induced bean creation
cascade).

Fixes gh-4624
