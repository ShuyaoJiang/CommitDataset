Auto-detect JMS sessionTransacted flag

If a JtaTransactionManager is present, it is associated with the
auto-created JmsListenerContainerFactory. However, if no such transaction
manager is present, local transaction support is not enabled.

This gives a default situation where the message is acknowledged even
before the listener is invoked. We now make sure to turn on local JMS
transactions if no JtaTransactionManager is present.

Fixes gh-3393
