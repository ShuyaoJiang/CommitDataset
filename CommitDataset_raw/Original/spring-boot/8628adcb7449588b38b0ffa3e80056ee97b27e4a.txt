Order EmbeddedServletContainerCustomizers

Add Ordered interface to all EmbeddedServletContainerCustomizers with
a value of 0. Prior to this commit it was difficult for a user to
define a customizer that would be applied before ours, even if they
implemented Ordered or added @Order annotations.

Fixes gh-2123
