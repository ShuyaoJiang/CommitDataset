Ensure that Undertow is stopped when it fails to start

Previously, if Undertow failed to start, some of Undertow's
internal components would have been started but the started field of
UndertowEmbeddedServletContainer remained false. This meant that when
stop() was called nothing was done as the container believed it had
not been started.

This commit updates UndertowEmbeddedServletContainer to stop both the
DeploymentManager and the Undertow instance in start() if an exception
is thrown. This aligns the behaviour of
UndertowEmbeddedServletContainer with that of the Tomcat equivalent.

Closes gh-10528
