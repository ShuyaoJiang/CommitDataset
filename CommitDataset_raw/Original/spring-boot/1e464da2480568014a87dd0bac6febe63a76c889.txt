Refactor the Actuator MVC configuration to allow more customization

There is a new spring.factories entry for
org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.EndpointWebMvcConfiguration
which loads extra beans into the MVC config for the Actuator.
If the management context is a child context all the beans go in the
child (except the Spring Security filter still). A big bonus is that
you can add WebConfigurerAdapters to configure static resources etc.
A new component called ManagementContextResolver can be used to
locate the ApplicationContext for the MVC endpoints.

Fixes gh-3345
