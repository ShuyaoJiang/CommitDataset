Add exclusion for well-known property types

Previously, any valid property was added to the meta-data of the current
group. This can be annoying for types that are not meant to be bound from
a simple string value. ClassLoader is one example.

A list of well-known types has been added: if the property type matches
an element of this list, it is ignored.

Fixes gh-2012
