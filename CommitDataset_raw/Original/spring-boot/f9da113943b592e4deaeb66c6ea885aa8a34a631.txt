Exclude FileEditor from binding conversion

Exclude `FileEditor` from the `BindConverter` since it uses slightly
unusual logic to create the file. Specifically, given a value of "."
the editor will locate a `ClassPathResource` then return `getFile()`
from that resource. For back-compatibility, binding should use the
simpler conversion service logic.
