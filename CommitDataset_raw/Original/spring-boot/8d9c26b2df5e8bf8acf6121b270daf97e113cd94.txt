Switch default to fail on error in SQL initialization

User can switch the behaviour on and off with
spring.datasource.continueOnError:true|false. I decided
not to add an extra nested level of property resolution
because of the existing spring.datasource.schema
(and other properties relating to initialization) because
concision seemed like a good thing with those more common
settings.

Fixes gh-374
