Add condition on MongoClientFactoryBean

This commit makes sure that the condition that links a `MongoClient` to
the embedded mongo server kicks in only if `MongoClientFactoryBean` is
also on the classpath.

Previously, only a condition on the mongo driver existed, leading to
`ClassNotFoundException` if Spring Data MongoDB wasn't available.
