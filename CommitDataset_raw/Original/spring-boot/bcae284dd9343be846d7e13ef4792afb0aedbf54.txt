Add a shim Endpoint if management context is child

When management endpoints are on a different port the HandlerMappings
are restricted to a single EndpointHandlerMapping, so the error
controller (which is a normal @Controller with @RequestMappings) does
not get mapped.

Fixed by addinga shim Endpoint on "/error" that delegates to the
ErrorController (which interface picks up an extra method).
