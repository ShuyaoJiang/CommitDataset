Restore WebServerInitializedEvent listener registration

This commit fixes ServerPortInfoApplicationContextInitializer so that
is registers a listener against `WebServerInitializedEvent`.

A former polish to use a lambda actually introduced a regression as the
listener was registered as `ApplicationListener<?>`.

Closes gh-10047
