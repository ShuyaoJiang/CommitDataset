Drop environment variable "__" list support

Remove support for the `__` environment variable list shortcut in order
to reduce complexity. The shortcut was developed before the new `Binder`
code was fully formed and isn't really necessary now since comma-lists
can be converted automatically.

Fixes gh-11410
