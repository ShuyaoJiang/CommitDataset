Add support to the Gradle plugin for disabling direct use of resources

The Maven plugin allows spring-boot:run to be configured so that
resources are loaded from their output location rather than from
src/main/resources. This commit adds an equivalent configuration
option to the Gradle plugin. To disable source resources from being
added to the classpath in place of those in the output location
the configure the bootRun tasks like this:

bootRun {
	addResources = false
}
