Add redirection to actuator endpoint

If a request to the actuator endpoint ends with a slash with Spring
HATEOAS on the classpath, an empty array of links is returned whereas
a request without the slash returns a response with all the expected
links to the actuator's other endpoints.

This commit adds an automatic redirection so that both URIs return the
expected result.

Closes gh-4575
