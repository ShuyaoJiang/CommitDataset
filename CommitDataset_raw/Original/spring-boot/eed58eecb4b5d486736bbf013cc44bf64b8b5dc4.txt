Improve error handling in EnableAutoConfigurationImportSelector

Previously, EnableAutoConfigurationImportSelector assumed that it
would always find auto-configuration attributes from an
@EnableAutoConfiguration annotation. This assumption does not hold
true in certain circumstances, although exactly what those
circumstances are is unclear. It could occur if the import selector
were used directly, but it's package-private making that unlikey. In
such circumstances a NullPointerException was being thrown.

This commit asserts that the attributes are non-null and, should the
assertion fail, produces an error that is more helpful than an NPE.

Closes gh-1512
