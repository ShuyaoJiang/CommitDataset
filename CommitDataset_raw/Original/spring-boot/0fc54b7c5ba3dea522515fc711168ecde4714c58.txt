Add ConditionalOnSingleCandidate

Add a new ConditionalOnSingleCandidate condition that determines if the
condition should match only if autowiring by type is guaranteed to
succeed. Used by auto-configuration that relies on a single candidate of
a given type (for instance, the JdbcTemplate auto-configuration relies on
the presence of a DataSource).

Such wiring by type will succeed if only one bean of that type is present
or if one matching instance is flagged "primary" amongst the candidates.

ConditionalOnSingleCandidate is a basic version of ConditionalOnBean that
only accepts a single type and does not determine a defaut based on its
presence on a bean definition.
