Add Http2 configuration properties

This commit adds a new configuration properties class for configuring
HTTP/2 protocol support.
By default, this protocol is disabled as enabling it requires several
manual changes:

* configuring a web server for proper TLS and ALPN support
* configuring a proper SSL certificate

See gh-10043
