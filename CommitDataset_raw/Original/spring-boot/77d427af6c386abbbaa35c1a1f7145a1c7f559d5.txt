Fix occasional Jetty test failures

Update `DefaultServletWebServerFactoryCustomizerTests` so that the Jetty
access log tests use the default timezone. Prior to this commit it was
possible that running the tests outside of UTC could result in Jetty
throwing a "negative delay" IllegalArgumentException.
