Rename Gradle plugin tests to work around Windows filename restrictions

The Gradle plugin integration tests find their Gradle build scripts
using a naming convention of ${ClassName}-${methodName}.gradle. This
convention led to two gradle scripts with filenames that were long
enough to causes problems on Windows.

This commit renames two test methods to reduce the length of their
names and, therefore, the names of their corresponding Gradle script
files.

Closes gh-10868
