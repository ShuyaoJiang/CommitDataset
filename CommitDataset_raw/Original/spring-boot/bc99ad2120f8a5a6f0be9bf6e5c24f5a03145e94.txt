Ignore Batch tests that use JDBC as they don’t work with Spring 4.2

Spring Framework’s ParamterizedRowMapper has been deprecated since
3.1 and has been removed in 4.2. Spring Batch currently relies on
ParameterizedRowMapper, making it incompatible with 4.2. To allow us to
build successfully against 4.2, this commit ignores Spring Boot’s tests
that use Spring Batch’s JDBC support.
