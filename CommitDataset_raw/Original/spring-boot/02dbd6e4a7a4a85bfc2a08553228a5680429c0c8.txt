Allow JarURLConnection to be created with a relative URL

Previously, JarURLConnection assumed that that URL with which it was
created would contain the absolute path of the underlying jar file.
This meant that when it was created with a relative URL, it could fail
to find an entry or throw a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException.

This commit updates the logic for normalizing the input URL so that
both absolute and relative URLs are supported.

Closes gh-6109
