Keep default Thymeleaf media types in reactive support

This commit removes the default configuration value previously set
for `spring.thymeleaf.reactive.media-types` since this value overrides
the defaults provided by Thymeleaf.

This value does not drive the default media type used by views, but
rather all media types that the templating engine should support.

Fixes gh-9134
