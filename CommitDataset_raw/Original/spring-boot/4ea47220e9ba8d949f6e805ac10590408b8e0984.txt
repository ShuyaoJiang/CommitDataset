Match nested paths for insensitive actuators

Update `ManagementWebSecurityAutoConfiguration` to match nested path
for insensitive actuators.

Prior to this commit, when Spring Security was on the classpath
nested paths were considered sensitive (even if the actuator
endpoint was not sensitive). i.e. when setting
`endpoints.env.sensitive=false` `/env` could be accessed without
authentication but `/env/user` could not.

Fixes gh-7868
Closes gh-7881
