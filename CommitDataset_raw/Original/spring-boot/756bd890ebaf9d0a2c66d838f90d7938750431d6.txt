Fix request factory used with TestRestTemplate withBasicAuth

This commit updates the behavior of withBasicAuth on TestRestTemplate
by trying to use the same request factory type as the underlying restTemplate.
If creation of a new instance of the configured request factory class fails,
it falls back to the `ClientHttpRequestFactorySupplier`.
