Consider only current context in WebFlux setup

This commit introduces a subclass of `DispatcherHandler` that only
considers the current context when looking for WebFlux infrastructure
beans.

This avoids issues where a child context (e.g. with Actuator) picks up
infrastructure beans from the parent context and exposes all endpoints
instead of getting only the ones from the current context.

Closes gh-14012
