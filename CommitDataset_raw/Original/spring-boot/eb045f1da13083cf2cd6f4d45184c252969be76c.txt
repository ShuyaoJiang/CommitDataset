Fix value of property in PropertySource descriptor

Prior to this commit, if a key was present in multiple PropertySources,
all descriptors shared the same common value. This commit makes sure
that each PropertySource descriptor shows the value it defines rather
than the one that is promoted in the Environment.

Closes gh-10428
