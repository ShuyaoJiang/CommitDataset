Enable logging of resolved exceptions

Previously, if an exception was resolved by a `HandlerExceptionResolver`
nothing the log indicated a failure to process the query.

This commit adds a new property `spring.mvc.log-resolved-exception` that
enables warning logs for supported `HandlerExceptionResolver` instances.

When Devtools is enabled, this flag is enabled by default.

Closes gh-2176
