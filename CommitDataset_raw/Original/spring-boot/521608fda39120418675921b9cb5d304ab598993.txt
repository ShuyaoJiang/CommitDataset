Extract CLI parsing from config file initializer

Extract command line property parsing logic from the
ConfigFileApplicationContextInitializer and instead perform it as part
of the SpringApplication initialization. This allows SpringApplications
that do not use the ConfigFileApplicationContextInitializer to still
expose command line arguments as property sources.

SpringApplicationInitializers may now implement EnvironmentAware if
they need access to the environment during early initialization.

This commit also removes the custom command line parsing logic that
was temporarily added to work around SPR-10579 which has since been
fixed upstream.
