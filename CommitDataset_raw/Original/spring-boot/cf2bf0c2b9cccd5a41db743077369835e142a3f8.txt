Work around javadoc bug when linking to annotation attributes

If an annotation attribute is linked to in javadoc before the
javadoc processor encounters a usage of the annotation, the javadoc
tool fails with a class cast exception. This is a known issue [1]
but it has been closed as won't fix so we need to work around it.
Sadly, the only reasonable way to do so appears to be to remove
the links to the annotation attributes and only link to the annotation
itself.
