Reinstate commons-logging exclusion on infinispan-spring4

Infinispan 8.0.2 has moved to Log4J2 for all logging, but still has a
transitive dependency on commons-logging. This resulted in
commons-logging 1.1 being on the classpath of spring-boot-docs which
breaks its javadoc generation.

Closes gh-4727
