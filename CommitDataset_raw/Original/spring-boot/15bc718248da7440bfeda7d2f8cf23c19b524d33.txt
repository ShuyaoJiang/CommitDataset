Apply server.jetty.* config to reactive servers

This commit applies `server.jetty.*` configuration properties
to Jetty when configured as a reactive web server.

It also removes some infrastructure support for Jetty 8, which
is not supported anymore in Spring Boot 2.0 (partial fix for
gh-11504).

See gh-11500
