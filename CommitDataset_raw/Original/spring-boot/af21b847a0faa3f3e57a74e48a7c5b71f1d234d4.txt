Add opt-in support for Neo4j-OGM native types

This includes tests for the autoconfiguration using that new property.
The test require the native types for Bolt and embedded in the test
scope, so the Neo4j-OGM native types have been added to managed
dependencies.

The enhanced autoconfiguration throws an
InvalidConfigurationPropertyValueException when native types cannot be
used due to missing dependencies or wrong transport mode.
