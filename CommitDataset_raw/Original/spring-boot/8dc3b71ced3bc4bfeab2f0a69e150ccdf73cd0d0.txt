Revert "Upgrade to Spring Integration 4.1.7.RELEASE"

This reverts commit bb9e1be72cc238cf9ccaf25b0aa830fe9f76b789.

4.1.7.RELEASE is incompatible with Spring IO Platform 1.1.x due to a
new dependency on kryo-shaded. kryo-shaded was introduced in Kryo
3.0.x but IO Platform 1.1.x uses Kryo 2.

See gh-4719
