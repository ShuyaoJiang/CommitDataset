Prevent erroneous "empty locations" log warnings

Update our `ResourceHttpRequestHandler` subclass so that the following
warning is no longer displayed:

  "Locations list is empty. No resources will be served unless a
  custom ResourceResolver is configured as an alternative to
  PathResourceResolver."

Fixes gh-6791
