Increase timeout for startup of embedded Cassandra

The integration tests for the Spring Data Cassandra sample application
fail intermittently, apparently due to Cassandra failing to start
within the default timeout period of 10000ms.

In attempt to get the tests to pass reliably, this commit increases
the timeout to 60000ms (1 minute).
