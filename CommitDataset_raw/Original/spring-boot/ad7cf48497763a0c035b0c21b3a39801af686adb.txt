Update Repackager to use Java 8 APIs safely

Previously, Repackager used Java 8 APIs without protecting against the
possibility of a NoSuchMethodError on earlier versions of Java.
This commit wraps the Java 8 APIs in try-catch blocks to ensure
that they do not cause a failure on Java versions before 8, while
still making full use of Java 8's capabilities when available.

Closes gh-5280
