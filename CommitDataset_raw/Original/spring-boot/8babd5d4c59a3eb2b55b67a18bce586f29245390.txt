Adapt to and from Mono when calling an operation on an endpoint

This commit adds support for adapting to and from Mono when calling
an operation on an endpoint.

When an endpoint is exposed using WebFlux, a call to a blocking
operation is adapted to return a Mono by dispatching the operation
invocation on a separate thread using Reactor's elastic scheduler.

When an endpoint is exposed using Jersey, a call to an endpoint that
returns a Mono is adapted to return the Mono's result by blocking
until it is available. Note that such adaptation is not necessary when
using Spring MVC as it supports Mono natively.

Closes gh-10112
