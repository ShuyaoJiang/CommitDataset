Perform binding at creation time if possible

Previously, environment binding always happened in a post processor once
the bean has been created. Constructor binding requires to perform the
binding at creating time so this commit performs binding at creation
time if possible.

When this happens, a special `ConfigurationPropertiesBeanDefinition` is
created with a supplier that invokes the binder. To avoid a case where
a bean is processed twice, the post-processor now ignores any bean that
has already been bound to the environment.
