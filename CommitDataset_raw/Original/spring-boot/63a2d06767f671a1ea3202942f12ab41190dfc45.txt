Explicitly disable security on management endpoints if requested

Previously the management endpoint filter was applied to all requests
if the user had disabled security.management.enabled, but since it
had no security applied it was letting all requests through.

The fix was to explicitly exclude the whole enclosing configuration
and carefully ignore the management endpoints in the normal security
chain.

Fixes gh-100.
