Propogate startup failures to management context

Update EndpointWebMvcAutoConfiguration so that ApplicationFailedEvents
cause the management context to close.

Prior to this commit if an application failed to start (for example
because `server.port` was already in use) the management context would
remain open and the application would not exit.

Fixes gh-5388
