Accommodate with Lombok generation ordering

Previously, if lombok was running before the configuration metadata
annotation processor, duplicated keys were created as both the
getter/setter and the special lombok handling applied.

This commit makes sure to be lenient by removing duplicate metadata
entries. This commit also makes sure to identify the getter of a
nested group if present. That way, the sourceMethod is set consistently
and avoid the creation of a duplicate group.

Closes gh-8886
