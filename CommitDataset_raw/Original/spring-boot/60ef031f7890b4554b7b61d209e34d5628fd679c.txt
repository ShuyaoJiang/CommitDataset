Fix "signer information does not match" error

Update ExecutableArchiveLauncher so that `-cp` URLs are not added
when they are already contained as nested JARs. This prevents a
SecurityException "signer information does not match error" when using
signed jars. The root cause of the issue was that the primary JAR file
was on the default classpath with the URL "file:....jar" and in the
main URL set as "jar:file:....jar". It is now filtered so that only
the "jar:" variant is added.

Fixes gh-1134
