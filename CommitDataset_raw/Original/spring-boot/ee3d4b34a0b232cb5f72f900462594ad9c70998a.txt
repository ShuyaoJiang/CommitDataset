Consider parent when application is built and then run

Previously, the parent context was only considered when the builder
was used to run the application. If the application was built using
the builder and then run using SpringApplication.run, the parent
context was not considered.

This commit updates the builder to consider the parent both when it's
used to run the application and when it's used to build the
application that will later be run via SpringApplication.run

Closes gh-4014
