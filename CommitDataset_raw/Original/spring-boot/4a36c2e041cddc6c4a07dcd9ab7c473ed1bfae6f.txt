Increase the timeout period for container startup in deployment tests

The build currently fails intermittently when an external container,
usually TomEE or Wildfly, fails to start within the default timeout
period of two minutes. This commit updates the timeout to 5 minutes for
all containers (Tomcat, TomEE and Wildfly) in the hope that it will
help to stabilise the CI build.
