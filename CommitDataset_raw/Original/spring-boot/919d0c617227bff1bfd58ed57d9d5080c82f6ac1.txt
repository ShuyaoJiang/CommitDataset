Use data binding to access spring.profiles .active and .include

Previously, spring.profiles.active and spring.profiles.include were
looked up manually. This meant that configuration that used indexes
(for example spring.profiles.active[0]=dev) were not bound. As a
result, YAML lists did not work.

This commit updates ConfigFileApplicationListener to use a
RelaxedDataBinder to retrieve the values of spring.profiles.active
and spring.profiles.include, thereby reusing the data binding logic
that supports property names with indexes.
