Support for simple numeric Flyway version

While Flyway's `MigrationVersion` is a String value, a simple "0" is
also a valid number. When such value is not wrapped in YAML, an integer
is injected rather than a String which leads to a failure as we can't
convert it.

This commit updates the `StringToMigrationVersionConverter` to also
supports conversion from a Number. This is a convenience for users
using YAML for configuration

Closes gh-4981
