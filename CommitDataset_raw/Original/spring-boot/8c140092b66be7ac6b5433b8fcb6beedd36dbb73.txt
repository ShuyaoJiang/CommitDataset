Fix key to disable the metrics filter

Commit d0cf6b5 introduced a `endpoints.metrics.filter.enabled` property
key meant to disable the filter. Unfortunately, the `endpoints.metrics`
namespace is already managed so setting this property will fail.

We now use the same key than the one used to disable the metrics
endpoint.

Closes gh-4365
