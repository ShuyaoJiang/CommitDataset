Try to fix problems caused by stricter config checking in docker-java 3.0

Previously, the launch script integration tests ran happily on OS X and
on Bamboo’s Linux instances. With the upgrade to docker-java 3.0 that
is no longer the case with the default DockerClientConfig failing on
Bamboo as the default DOCKER_CERT_PATH location does not exist.

This commit updates the client configuration so that it attempts to
build the configuration once in it default configuration and, if this
fails, it tries again without TLS verification. This skips the check
of DOCKER_CERT_PATH’s validity.
