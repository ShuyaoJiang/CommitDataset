Fix ConfigurationPropertySources parent attach

Update `ConfigurationPropertySources` so that the underlying sources
are checked when attaching. Prior to this commit, in a parent/child
setup the `ConfigurationPropertySources` adapter may already present
on the parent. This means the attaching is skipped but the managed
sources are incorrect.

Fixes gh-12013
