Use git.commit.id.abbrev if present

Currently GitProperties always shortens the property git.commit.id to an
hardcoded length of 7.

However, both the Maven plugin git-commit-id-plugin and the Gradle
plugin gradle-git-properties are now providing the property
git.commit.id.abbrev along with the propery git.commit.id.
Moreover, the Maven plugin allows to customize the length of the
abbreviated commit ID with the configuration abbrevLength. The Gradle
plugin doesn't allow (yet) to configure this length.

Closes gh-8773
