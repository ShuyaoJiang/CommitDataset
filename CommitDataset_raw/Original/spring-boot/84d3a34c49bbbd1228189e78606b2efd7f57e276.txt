Add CORS support to the actuator’s endpoints

This commit adds CORS support to the Actuator’s MVC endpoints. CORS
support is disabled by default and is only enabled once the
endpoints.cors.allowed-origins property has been set.

The new properties to control the endpoints’ CORS configuration are:

endpoints.cors.allow-credentials
endpoints.cors.allowed-origins
endpoints.cors.allowed-methods
endpoints.cors.allowed-headers
endpoints.cors.exposed-headers

The changes to enable Jolokia-specific CORS support (57a51ed) have been
reverted as part of this commit. This provides a consistent approach
to CORS configuration across all endpoints, rather than Jolokia using
its own configuration.

Closes gh-2936
