Auto-Configure Freemarker in WebFlux

This commit adds support for basic auto-configuration for the Freemarker
template engine in WebFlux.

A few configuration properties in the `spring.freemarker.*` namespace
aren't supported yet, since they mostly apply to MVC (Servlet request
and session attributes).

Closes gh-10094
