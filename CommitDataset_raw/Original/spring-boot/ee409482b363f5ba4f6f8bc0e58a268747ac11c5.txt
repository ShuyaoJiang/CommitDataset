Enable the use of formatter off and on tags in Eclipse

This commit enables the use of // @formatter:off and // @formatter:on
to surround lines of code that should not be formatted. It also adds
a code template that can be used to quickly wrap the selected lines
of text with the off and on comments.

Closes gh-5050
