Ensure DeploymentInfo contextPath is never "/"

Undertow 1.1 expects that DeploymentInfo.contextPath is set to "/" for
a root context. If it is left as "" the session cookie path is not
correctly set. See UNDERTOW-350 for background.

This commit simplifies the original work-around committed in 78c22813d.

Fixes gh-2065
