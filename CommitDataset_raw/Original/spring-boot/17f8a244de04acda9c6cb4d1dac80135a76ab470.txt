Fix property names with successive capital letters

Previously, if a property name had successive capital letters, the
generated meta-data would clean it in such a way it is defined as a
regular word. For instance a `myFOO` property would be written as
`my-foo` in the meta-data.

It turns out this decision is wrong as the binder has no way to compute
back the name of the property and therefore `my-foo` wouldn't bind to
`setMyFOO` as it should.

This commit updates the meta-data name generation algorithm to properly
identify such cases: `myFOO` now translates to `my-f-o-o`. While the
generated name is a bit ugly, it now provides a consistent binding
experience.

Closes gh-5330
