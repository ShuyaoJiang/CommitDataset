Support of Lombok annotated ConfigurationProperties

Previously, no configuration properties were discovered on a class using
lombok instead of regular getters/setters.

This commit adds a support for some of the lombok annotations,
specifically that is @Data, @Getter and @Setter. Provides the same
semantic as what lombok is generating.

Closes gh-2114
