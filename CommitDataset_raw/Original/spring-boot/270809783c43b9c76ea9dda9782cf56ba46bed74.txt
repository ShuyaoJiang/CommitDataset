Merge @ConditionalOnPropertyValue

This commit merges the features of @ConditionalOnPropertyValue
to the existing @ConditionalOnProperty.

The "match" attribute provides the value to match against. By default,
the value should not be equal to "false" which is the existing default
of @ConditionalOnProperty. "defaultMatch" specifies if the value
should be present. The default matches also the existing behavior of
@ConditionalOnProperty.

Fixes gh-1000
