Remove redundant deprecated attribute

The `deprecated` attribute is deprecated as of Spring Boot 1.3 and
replaced by the `deprecation` object. Any IDE relying on the previous
structure still expects the `deprecated` attribute though.

The annotation processor is adding that information automatically when it
merges manual content so it is not necessary to define that attribute in
the source.

Closes gh-4127
