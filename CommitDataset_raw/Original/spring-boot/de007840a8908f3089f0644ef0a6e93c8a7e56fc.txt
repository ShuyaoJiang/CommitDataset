Spring Session auto-configuration expansion

This implementation was inspired in large part by the cache
auto-configuration. In addition to the originally supported Redis, now
Hazelcast, an in-memory map, as well as a no-op option are supported. It
should be easy to extend this to include additional data stores in the
future.

Closes gh-3811
