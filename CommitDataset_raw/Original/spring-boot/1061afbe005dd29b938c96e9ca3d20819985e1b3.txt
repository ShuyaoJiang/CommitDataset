Reuse `ConfigurationProperties` bean defined in parent

This commit makes sure that if a `ConfigurationProperties` annotated bean
already exists in the parent context, a new one is not created in the
child anymore.

This makes sure that a single bean exists in a parent/child hierarchy if
`@EnableConfigurationProperties` is processed in both context on the same
class.

Closes gh-8187
