Add 3xx redirects to the "unmapped" class of requests for metrics

When Spring Security sends 302 responses to a login page we don't get
any information about the request matching in Spring MVC. Consequently
apps can end up with a lot of counter.status.302.* metrics (where
"*" can be whatever the user sent).

This change treats 3xx the same as 4xx (if it is unmapped it just gets
added to a metric called "unmapped" instead of using the actual request
path).

Fixes gh-2563
