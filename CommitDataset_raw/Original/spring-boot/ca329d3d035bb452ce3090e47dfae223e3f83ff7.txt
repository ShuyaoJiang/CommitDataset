Update Jersey indicator class to one that requires the Servlet API

Previously, if WebFlux and Jersey were on the classpath, but there was
no Servlet API (and no embedded container) on the classpath, the web
application type would be prevented from being reactive. The absence
of the Servlet API would then prevent the web application type from
being servlet so it would be none.

By contrast, if Spring MVC was on the classpath in place of Jersey
the absence of the Servlet API would allow the web application type to
be reactive. This happened because the Spring MVC indicator class is
DispatcherServlet which requires the Servlet API.

This commit updates the Jersey indicator class to be ServletContainer.
This class is both an HttpServlet and a Filter so it too requires the
Servlet API and, therefore, further aligns the deduction behaviour for
Jersey and Spring MVC.

Closes gh-14701
