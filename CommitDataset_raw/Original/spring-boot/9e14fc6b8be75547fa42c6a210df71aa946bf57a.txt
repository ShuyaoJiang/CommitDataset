Cope with hanging call to connection.start() in JmsHealthIndicator

Previously, if the call to connection.start() hung, JmsHealthIndicator
would also hang and then never respond.

This commit introduces the use of an additional thread that waits for
up to 5 seconds for the connection to start. If the call to start
does not complete within that time, the connection is closed. The
call to close causes the call to start to throw an exception, thereby
stopping the hang and allowing the indicator to report that the
broker is down.

Closes gh-10809
