Only associate JTA transaction manager to JMS factory

The JMS MessageListenerContainer supports the PlatformTransactionManager
abstraction with either a `JmsTransactionManager` for local transactions
or `JtaTransactionManager` for distributed transactions. The former is
kind of deprecated (`setTransacted` should be used instead). In any case,
any other `PlatformTransactionManager` implementation is not supported.

Update JmsAnnotationDrivenConfiguration to only associated a JTA
transaction manager, if any.

Closes gh-3150
