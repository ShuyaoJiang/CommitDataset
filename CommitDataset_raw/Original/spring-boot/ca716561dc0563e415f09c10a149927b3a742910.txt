Update deployment test exclusions after web starter validation changes

The changes made in a6c1668b mean that the web starter no longer
depends on spring-boot-starter-validation. Instead, it depends
directly on hibernate-validator. This means that the exclusion of the
validation starter in the TomEE deployment test app no longer matches
anything and hibernate-validator is packaged in the war. This breaks
the application as TomEE ships with Bean Validation 2.0 and the
version of Hibernate Validator being used requires 2.1.

This commit updates the exclusions in the TomEE deployment app so that
hibernate-validator is excluded once again. This allows the app to
use TomEE's bundled Bean Validation implementation.

The stale spring-boot-starter-validation exclusion has been removed
from the Wildfly deployment test app. It is redundant as Wildfly ships
with Bean Validation 2.1. This brings this test app into line with
the Glassfish test app.

Closes gh-5454
