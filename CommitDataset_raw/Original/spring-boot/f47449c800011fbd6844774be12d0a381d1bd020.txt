Remove Servlet API dependency from SecurityProperties

A dependency on the Servlet API (the filter's dispatcher types) causes
a failure when Spring Security is used in a non-web application.

This commit removes the dependency on javax.servlet.DispatcherType
in favour of using a Set of Strings. SecurityFilterAutoConfiguration,
which is only enabled for web applications, is the responsible for
converting each String to a DispatcherType.

Closes gh-4505
