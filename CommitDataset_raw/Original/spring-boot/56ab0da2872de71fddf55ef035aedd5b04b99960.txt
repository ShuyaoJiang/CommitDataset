Support EncodedResourceResolver in resource chain

As of https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-16381, Spring Framework now
supports both gzip and Brotli as compression formats for static
resources resolved by the resource chain.

The `GzipResourceResolver` has been deprecated and replaced by the
`EncodedResourceResolver`. This commit uses this new resolver and adapts
the configuration key to reflect those changes.

Note that this resolver is now configured ahead of the
`VersionResourceResolver`.

Closes gh-13242
