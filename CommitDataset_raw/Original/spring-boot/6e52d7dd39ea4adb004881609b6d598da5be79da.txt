[bs-134] CLI app cannot resolve snapshot jars

Moved the Grab.addResolver() call to before any other compiler
customizations.

That got it working locally (removed ~/.m2 and ~/.groovy/grapes)
but still not working on cloudfoundry for some reason.  We need
more help from buildpacks there (to get a cache going for the
grapes), but there seems to be more than just that stopping it
(maybe just timeouts?).
