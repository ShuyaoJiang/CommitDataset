Allow default profile to also be set in properties

Update `ConfigFileApplicationListener` so that active profiles set in
properties files that overlap with `spring.profiles.default` can still
be set.

Prior to this commit if `spring.profiles.active` happened to specify
a profile name that was also in `spring.profiles.default` it would
not get applied.

Fixes gh-6833
