Fix JPA bootstrap executor detection with multiple candidates

Spring Boot provides two separate auto-configurations that can
potentially expose an `AsyncTaskExecutor` implementation so relying on
the presence of a single instance is too weak.

This commit fixes the detection of the AsyncTaskExecutor that can be
used to bootstrap JPA so that a single instance is used and, in the case
more than one exists, the one named `applicationTaskExecutor`.

Closes gh-15447
