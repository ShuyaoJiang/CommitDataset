Ensure that javadoc is generated in a full build

For reasons that I donâ€™t understand, Maven has decided to stop running
the javadoc:jar task as part of the package phase. It appears to be
related to the addition of the build-helper plugin in
spring-boot-dependencies. Binding javadoc:jar to the prepare-package
phase convinces Maven to run it, apparently without any unwanted side
effects.
