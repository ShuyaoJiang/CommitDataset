Remove misplaced re-ordering of default property source

The early re-ordering (and in particular the temporary remove of the
default properties) seemed to be a relic of an older approach that is
no longer there since we refactored to support more sane profile ordering.
Removing it doesn't seem to break anything and it allows you to specify
the config file locations in SpringApplicationBuilder.properties().

Fixes gh-953, fixes gh-920
