Samples cleanup

- Modifying dependencies to starter-web with tomcat exclusion plus
  alternative servlet container instead of manual dependency on
  spring-webmvc as it is the preferrable way to use alternative servlet
  container
- Previously RestTemplate with ssl was configured manually in tests - now
  it rellies on autoconfiguration - changed this for multi-connector test
  and added test to ensure that ssl autoconfiguration is working
- Most samples with alterntative servlet containers used some kind of
  service reading property and returning default since it wasn't
  configured - removed it, since it is not specific to using alternative
  servlet containers.
