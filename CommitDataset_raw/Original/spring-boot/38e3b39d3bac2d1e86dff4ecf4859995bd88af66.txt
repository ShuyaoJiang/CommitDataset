Improves metrics performance by not guarding map.get

ConcurrentHashMap implements `containsKey` with `get`. By removing a
redundant call to `containsKey`, we guarantee better performance in our
counter services.

The geek inside measured this with JMH, and found under 4 threads of
contention, throughput on this check was 40% higher in success case.
