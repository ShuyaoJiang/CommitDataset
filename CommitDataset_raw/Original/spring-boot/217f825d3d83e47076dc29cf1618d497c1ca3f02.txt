Clarify DataSourceAutoConfiguration

The `DataSource` auto-configuration in Spring Boot supports two modes:
regular pooled DataSource and embedded database (via the
`EmbeddedDatabase` infrastructure provided by `spring-jdbc`. These were
previously named `NonEmbedded` and `Embedded` respectively.

This commit clarifies those mode and in particular that a pooled
`DataSource` can also handle an embedded database.

Closes gh-4634
