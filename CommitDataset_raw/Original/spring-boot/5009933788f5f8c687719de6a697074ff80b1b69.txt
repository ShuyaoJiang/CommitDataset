Move to constructor injection in simple configuration classes

This commit updates "simple" configuration classes to use constructor
injection. Simple means that there are no optional dependencies
(@Autowired(required=false) is not used), and none of the dependencies
use generics.

Configuration classes that are not simple will be updated in a second
pass once https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-14015 has been fixed.

See gh-5306
