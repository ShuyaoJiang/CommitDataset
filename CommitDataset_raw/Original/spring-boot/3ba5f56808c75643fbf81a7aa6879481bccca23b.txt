[bs-138] Add @OnManagementContext for management beans

User adds @OnManagementContext to a bean or @Configuration and
it should be included in the management context (if there is one)
whether it is the main context or a child.

Makes it easy to secure the management endpoints and keep
the rest open (see actuator-ui-sample).
