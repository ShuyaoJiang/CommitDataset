Prevent ErrorPageFilter from being used if SBServletInitializer is used

Previously, the configuration class that produces the ErrorPageFilter
bean was an inner class of SpringBootServletInitializer. As a result,
whenever SpringBootServletInitializer was subclasses, the
ErrorPageFilter would be used. This adversely affected applications
running as an executable war file and those deployed to a container
with error page filter registration disabled.

This commit makes ErrorPageFilterConfiguration a top-level class so
that it is no longer always found via SpringBootServletInitializer.
The test that verifies that error page filter registration can be
disabled has been updated to more accurately simulate the behaviour
when an application is deployed as a war to a standalone container.
A test that mimics the behaviour of an application run as an
executable war has also been added.

Closes gh-8477
