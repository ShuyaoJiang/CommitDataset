Ignore unbound collection properties if collection bound

As of Spring Boot 2.0, if Collection properties are specified in
multiple property sources, only the elements from the property source
with the highest precedence are used for binding. This caused an
`UnboundConfigurationPropertiesException` if the size of the collection
from the higher order property source was smaller and `ignoreUnknownFields`
was set to true.

This commit ignores unbound collection properties if the
collection was properly bound.

Fixes gh-16290
