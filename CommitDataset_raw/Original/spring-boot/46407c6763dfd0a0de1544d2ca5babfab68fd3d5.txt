Align JPA sample with Hibernate 5.1’s table naming

The name of the table for a many-to-many relationship has changed in
Hibernate 5.1.

This commit updates the JPA sample’s import.sql accordingly. It also
updates the repository integration tests to verify that the data has
been imported successfully.
