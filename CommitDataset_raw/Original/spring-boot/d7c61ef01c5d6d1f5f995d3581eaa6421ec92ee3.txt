Drop ShellProperties.setAdditionalProperties

Drop the setAdditionalProperties method from ShellProperties to ensure
that it is not included in the meta-data JSON. The additional properties
are usually wired in using @Autowired and it is pretty unlikely that
anyone is using the setter directly.

Fixes gh-2055
