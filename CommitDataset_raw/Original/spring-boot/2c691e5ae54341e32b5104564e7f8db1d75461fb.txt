Enhance JarCommand to support lists of includes and excludes

The lists are comma separated. In addition, user can add prefixes
"+" or "-", to signal that those values should be removed from the
default list, not added to a fresh one. E.g.

$ spring jar app.jar --include lib/*.jar,-static/** --exclude -**/*.jar

to include a jar file specifically, and make sure it is not excluded,
and additionally not include the static/** resources that would otherwise
be included in the defaults. As soon as "+" or "-" prefixes are detected
the default entries are all added (except the ones exlcuded with "-").

Fixes gh-1090
