Clarify commons-pool2 requirement for redis

`JedisConnectionFactory` needs `commons-pool2` for quite some time now
and our auto-configuration had a special case to handle redis if
`commons-pool2` isn't available.

This commit removes that code as using it would lead to a failure anyway.

Closes gh-5718
