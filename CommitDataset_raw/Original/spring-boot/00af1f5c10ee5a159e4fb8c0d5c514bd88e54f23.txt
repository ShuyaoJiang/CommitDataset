Flag main MbeanExporter `@Primary`

When the actuator is enabled, Spring Boot provides two `MBeanExporter`
bean definitions: a general purpose one and a dedicated one for Actuator
endpoints.

This commit flag the general purpose one `@Primary` so that component
can safely inject it by type if necessary. In particular, this fix the
doc of the `JmxMetricWriter`.

Closes gh-4007
