Make EmbeddedVelocityToolboxView work in servlet container deployments

EmbeddedVelocityToolboxView is used with both embedded containers and
when a Spring Boot application is deployed to a servlet container. It
process the ServletContext to intercept calls to getResource so that it
can load Velocity’s toolbox.xml file from within an executable jar.
Previously, when it created the proxy, it didn’t specify the ClassLoader
to use. This resulted in the proxy being created using the ClassLoader
that loaded the Class that is being proxied. This fails when the
application is deployed to a ServletContainer as the ClassLoader that
loaded the ServletContext implementation is the container’s ClassLoader
and it cannot see the classes that are specific to the web application.

This commit updates EmbeddedVelocityToolboxView to specify the
ClassLoader to use when creating the proxy. It specifies its own
ClassLoader thereby ensuring that the proxy creation can load
application-specific classes.
