Handle relative pid folder correctly in the launch script

Previously, a relative PID folder was not handled correctly when
running stop, status, or force_reload. This meant that a service
could be started when configured to use a relative pid file, but
then could not be stopped.

The PID folder should be treated as relative to the service's jar
file. This commit updates stop, status, and force_reload to push the
jar file's directory so that this is now the case for those three
commands.

Closes gh-7092
