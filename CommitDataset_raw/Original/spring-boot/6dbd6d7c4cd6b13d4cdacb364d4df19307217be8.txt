[bs-178] Use OpenEntityManagerInView by default in webapp with JPA

If JPA is used and the context is a webapp we add the OEMIV interceptor.
It can be switched off by the user declaring a bean of type OEMSIVI or
the corresponding Filter, or by setting spring.jpa.open_in_view=false.

[Fixes #52939983]
