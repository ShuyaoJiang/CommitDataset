Fix path stripper in JolokiaEndpoint to account for management.contextPath

When the user sets management.contextPath=/admin the Jolokia
endpoint gets mapped to /admin/jolokia, but that the path stripper it uses
internally makes a false assumption about the form of the request path.
The fix is simple (just use a smarter search for the endpoint path in the
request path).

Fixes gh-642
