Add support for ANSI colored resource banners

Add AnsiPropertySource which allows named ANSI codes to be resolved
and update ResourceBanner to include it.

This commit also deprecates constants defined in AnsiElement and
replaces them with AnsiStyle, AnsiColor and AnsiBackground enums.

Closes gh-2704
