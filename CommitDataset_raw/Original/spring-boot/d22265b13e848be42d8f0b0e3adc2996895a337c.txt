Allow to disable debug property

Previously, adding `debug=false` in the environment had no effect as the
mere presence of the property was used to enable the debug mode. This
commit makes sure to also check the value and ignore the property if it
is set to `false`.

The documentation has also been updated to refer to the `trace` property.

Closes gh-5374
