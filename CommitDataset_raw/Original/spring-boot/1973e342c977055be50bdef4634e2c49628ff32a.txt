Do not use lambda for task action as it breaks up-to-date checks

Due to gradle/gradle#5510, using a lambda for a task action breaks
up-to-date checks in certain circumstances.

This commit updates JavaPluginAction to use an inner-class in place
of a lambda for the action that it adds to JavaCompile tasks. A test
has not been added as it does not appear to be possible to reproduce
it with a TestKit-based test.

Closes gh-14054
