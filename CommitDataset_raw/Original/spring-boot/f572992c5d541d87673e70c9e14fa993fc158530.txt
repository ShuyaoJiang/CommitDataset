Relax requirement for groovy template directory to exist

Since groovy-templates is included with groovy-all it is unreasonable
to expect anyone who has it on their classpath to have resolvable templates.
We may need to revisit this decision, but since the origain feature
that drove this was thymeleaf and idaiotic users having it on their
classpath but not using it, maybe we don't need to.
