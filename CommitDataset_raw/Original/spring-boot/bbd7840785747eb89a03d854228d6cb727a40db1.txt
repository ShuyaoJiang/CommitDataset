Allow LoggingSystem to be disabled

In certain environments, such as Jetty configured with centralized
logging, Spring Boot's logging system can be problematic.

This commit adds support for using the existing LoggingSystem system
property, configured with a value of none, to disable the logging
system and rely on the standard logging configuration mechanism for
whatever logging framework is in use.

Closes gh-3571
