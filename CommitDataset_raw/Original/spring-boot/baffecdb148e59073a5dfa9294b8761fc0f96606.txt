Add runApplication() Kotlin top level function

Since Kotlin extensions do not apply to static
methods, this commit introduces a runApplication()
Kotlin top level function that acts as a Kotlin
shortcut for SpringApplication.run().

This shortcut avoids to require using non-idiomatic
code like SpringApplication.run(FooApplication::class.java)
and provides a runApplication<FooApplication>() alternative
(as well as an array of KClass based alternative when
multiple classes need to be passed as parameter).

It is possible to customize the application with the
following syntax:

runApplication<FooApplication>() {
    setEnvironment(environment)
}

See gh-10511
