Remove redundant include from WebFluxTypeExcludeFilter

For webflux, security configuration is configured via a bean of type
`SecurityWebFilterChain` and not `ServerHttpSecurity`. We would have changed
the include to be `SecurityWebFilterChain` but the filter only applies to
beans registered via component scanning and not those registered in
`@Configuration` classes, making the includes redundant.
