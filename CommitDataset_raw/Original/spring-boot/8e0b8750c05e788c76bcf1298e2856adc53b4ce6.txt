Cleanup description new-lines for launch script

Replace all new-line characters in multi-line pom descriptions before
inserting into the launcher script. Prior to this commit the shell would
attempt to execut the extra lines, for example:

	<description>
		A multi-line pom description that could do something terrible:
		rm -r foo
	</description>

Closes gh-4703
