Use explicit classpath: prefix for Flyway location

Flyway implicitly adds classpath: to locations without a prefix but
resource loader fails to find migratons on the classpath without the
prefix.

Add an explicit classpath: prefix so that both Flyway and the resource
loader used to check the locations can find the migration location.
