Support Jetty RS as HTTP driver for WebClient

This commit adds a new auto-configuration choice for
`ClientHttpConnector`, this time using the Jetty RS HTTP client library
if available.

This is the best choice in case the application runs on a Jetty reactive
server, as both client and server will share resources.

Closes gh-14005
