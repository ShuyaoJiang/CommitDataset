Add missing handle-as meta-data

Liquibase has a `changeLog` property that is definitely used as a
`Resource` but cannot be defined as such as the original String value
should be kept against an API we don't control.

Update the tests also to make it more clear that if hints are added
against a property that is detected automatically, said property still
keeps all its auto-discovered capabilities.

Closes gh-3457
