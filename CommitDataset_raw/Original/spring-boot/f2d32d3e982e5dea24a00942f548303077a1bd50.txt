Add support for property deprecation

Previously, an item could only have a 'deprecated' boolean flag to
indicate that the property is deprecated. It is desirable to provide an
additional description for the deprecation as well as the name of the
property to use instead.

The `deprecated` boolean flag is now supported. Instead, a `deprecated`
object can be specified with two optional attributes: `reason` to provide
an explanation for the deprecation and `replacement` to refer to the
property that should be used instead. If none of them is present, an
empty deprecation object should be set.

For backward compatibility, the `deprecated` field is still set.

Deprecation information can only set via manual meta-data.

Closes gh-3449
