Refactor PropertySourcesDeducer

Prior to the changes that fixed #12451,
`FilteredPropertySources` and `CompositePropertySources` were required
by the `PropertySourcesDeducer` to ensure that configuration properties binding
could see changes to the environment even when there was a
PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer in the context. #12451 changed the way
property sources are adapted by `SpringConfigurationPropertySources`, removing the
need for `FilteredPropertySources` and `CompositePropertySources`.

Fixes gh-13738
