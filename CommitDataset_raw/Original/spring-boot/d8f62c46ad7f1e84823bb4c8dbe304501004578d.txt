Prevent warning due to BPP dependency

`MethodValidationPostProcessor` requires a `Validator` so we need to flag
it as an infrastructure bean to prevent an additional log that indicates
it won't be post-processed.

We obviously don't want to post-process the `Validator` here so adding the
additional meta-data is a good idea anyway.

Closes gh-8422
