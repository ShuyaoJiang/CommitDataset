Separate Jersey WebApplicationInitializer from auto-configuration class

Previously, JerseyAutoConfiguration was a WebApplicationInitializer.
This was problematic as auto-configuration classes should not be ordered
(they should use AutoConfigureBefore etc instead) but the web
application initializer needs to be ordered so that it can run early and
configure Jersey before it runs.

This commit has moved the WebApplicationInitializer implementation into
a separate class so that it can be ordered independently of the
auto-configuration class. Note that the new class must be public for
the servlet container (Tomcat at least) to be able to instantiate it.

Closes gh-4527
