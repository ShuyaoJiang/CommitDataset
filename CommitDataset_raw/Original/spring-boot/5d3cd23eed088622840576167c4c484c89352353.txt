Use custom DataSource if Flyway or Liquibase has user or url

This commit enables a more flexible Liquibase/Flyway configuration by
allowing for a combination of the provider's and the primary
DataSource's configuration to be used. This gives developers the
flexibility to specify only a user or a url and having
Liquibase/Flyway fall back to individual datasource properties rather
than ignoring the Liquibase/Flyway properties and falling back to the
default data source.
