Add FilterRegistrationBean.REQUEST_WRAPPER_FILTER_MAX_ORDER constant

All the filters added explicitly by Spring Boot now have order <=
FilterRegistrationBean.REQUEST_WRAPPER_FILTER_MAX_ORDER (value 0).
There is nothing we can do about the DispatcherServlet and anything
else downstream of the filter chain.

Fixes gh-3613
