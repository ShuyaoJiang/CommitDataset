Properly guard ManagementSecurityAutoConfiguration

ManagementSecurityAutoConfiguration fully relies on the presence of a
web environment, yet the configuration class itself was not guarded by
`@ConditionalOnWebApplication` (while nested config where).

This turned out to be a problem for command-line applications using
spring security (i.e. CRaSH integration).

Fixes gh-2112
