Make `spring.session.store-type` mandatory

Previously, Spring Session would be auto-configured by the mere presence
of Spring Session in the classpath. This was fragile as determining a
store type according to the environment could easily change when the
classpath of the project changes.

This commit makes the store-type property mandatory. If it is not set,
Spring Session is no longer auto-configured.

Closes gh-5838
