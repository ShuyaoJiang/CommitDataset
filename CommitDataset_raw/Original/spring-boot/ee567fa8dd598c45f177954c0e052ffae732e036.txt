Make MetricRegistryMetricReader thread-safe

MetricRegistryMetricReaderâ€™s fields where neither final, nor volatile
but could be accessed on multiple threads. This lead to visibility
problems where the value of a field would unexpectedly be null, causing
an NPE.

This commit updates all of the fields to declare them as final, thereby
ensuring that their values are guaranteed to be visible across different
threads.
