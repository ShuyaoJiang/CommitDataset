Allow adding additional tld skip patterns

This commit improves `TomcatEmbeddedServletContainerFactory` so that tld
skip patterns can be set or added to an existing set. An additional
`server.tomcat.additional-tld-skip-patterns` is now being exposed to
easily add patterns via configuration.

Closes gh-5010
