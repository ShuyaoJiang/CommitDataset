Ensure Spring Integration 4.0 is used in CLI

There was an issue with the generated poms for the dependency
tools (I'm not sure the generation step works if you don't
do "mvn clean"). Anyway I verified that it works and removed
the (now) unnecessary provided dependency from spring-boot-cli.

Fixes gh-362
