Change the way the AggregateMetricReader works to make it easier

for users to get started. It also makes it more flexible if different
aggregation keys are needed depending on the environment. The most
important new feature is the
spring.metrics.export.redis.aggregateKeyPattern configuration, which
fits the *.redis.key and prefix defaults. The aggregate reader uses
a prefix based on the key by default, with a naming convention that
the key starts with "keys.".
