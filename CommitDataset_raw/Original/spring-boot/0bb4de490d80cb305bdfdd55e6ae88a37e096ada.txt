Allow any ExitCodeGenerator bean to switch of auto-configured bean

In bedf2edf, the return type of the auto-configuration method that
creates batch's ExitCodeGenerator was changed from ExitCodeGenerator
to JobExecutionExitCodeGenerator but the on missing bean condition
was left unchanged. This means that the auto-configured bean can
only be switched off by a JobExecutionExitCodeGenerator bean, rather
than any bean that implements ExitCodeGenerator.

This commit corrects the use of @ConditionalOnMissingBean to allow any
ExitCodeGenerator bean to switch off the auto-configured one.

Closes gh-4752
