Support resolution of HAL link titles from a resource bundle

Spring HATEOAS 0.19.0.RELEASE provide support for resolving a link’s
title by looking up the key _links.$rel.title. For us to take advantage
of this in Spring Boot, HalHandlerInstantiator must be created using
the link relation message source that’s automatically created by
HateoasConfiguration.
