Try to make the tests for the Cassandra sample more robust

Cassandra sometimes takes a long time when dropping the test keyspace.
This results in the test failing due to an exception being thrown.
This commit attempts to make the tests more robust by catching and
logging any exceptions thrown during server cleanup.
