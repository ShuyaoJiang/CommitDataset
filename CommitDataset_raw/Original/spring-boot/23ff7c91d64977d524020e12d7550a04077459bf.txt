Add debug logging to ConfigFileApplicationListener

Update ConfigFileApplicationListener to include more debug level output.
Debug messages are recorded during onApplicationEnvironmentPreparedEvent
but not actually output until onApplicationPreparedEvent. This is
because the logging level might not have been correctly set until the
context is completely prepared.

Fixes gh-1584
