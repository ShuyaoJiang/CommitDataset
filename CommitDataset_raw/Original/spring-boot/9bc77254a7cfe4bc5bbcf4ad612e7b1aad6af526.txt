Start building against Spring Framework 5 snapshot

This commit enables compatibility build against Spring Framework 5.

The Velocity and Guava support that are deprecated in the 1.x line have
been removed and few other classes contain minor change to comply to non
backward compatible changes in Spring Framework 5.

This commit also switches the required java version to 8.

Closes gh-6977
