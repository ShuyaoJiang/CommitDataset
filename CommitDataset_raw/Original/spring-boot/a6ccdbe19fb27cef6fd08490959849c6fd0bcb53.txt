Handle missing exceptions in WebMvcMetricsFilter

Prior to this commit, exceptions nested in
`NestedServletExceptions` would not be recorded by the
`WebMvcMetricsFilter`. This commit ensures that exceptions
happening downstream (e.g. happening while writing the response
body itself) are properly recorded.
