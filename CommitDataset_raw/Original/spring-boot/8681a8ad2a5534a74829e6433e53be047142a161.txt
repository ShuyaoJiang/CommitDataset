Map empty virtual host to "/" when parsed from an address

Previously, an address that ended in a "/" would result in the virtual
host being an empty string. This was inconsistent with setVirtualHost
which would map an empty string to "/".

This commit updates the address parsing logic to call setVirtualHost
rather than assigning the value directly to this.virtualHost. This
ensures that the special handling for an empty string is applied
consistently.

Closes gh-3304
