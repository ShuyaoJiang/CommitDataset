Do not expose the composite ReactiveHealthIndicator as a bean

Previously, a `ReactiveHealthIndicator` bean was exposed to define the
health indicator to use for the reactive endpoint. Having it exposed as
a bean has the side effect that the regular `HealthIndicator` composite
is picked up and a "reactive" entry is added to the health details.

This commit creates such indicator internally as it should be.

Closes gh-11222
