Cross link Actuator and User Guide docs

Not having READMEs in github is a mistake IMO, so here's one
restored and with a link to the docs. Docs also updated to
more accurately reflect the location of the actuator features
in implementation.

See https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-actuator-service/pull/7
for the Getting started guide change

Fixes gh-1014
