Remove JSR-330 configuration annotations

Replace JSR-330 validation annotations from all internal
`@ConfigurationProperties` classes with standard Asserts.

Prior to this commit validation of our own configuration properties
would only occur when the user happens to have compliant JSR-330
implementation on their classpath.

See gh-7579
