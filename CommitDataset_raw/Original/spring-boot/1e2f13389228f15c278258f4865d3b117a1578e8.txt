Use fast exceptions in findResource(s)

Some libraries like aspectj are using findResource to see the raw
bytecode of a class. It will even call findResource for every method of
every class of beans that are post processed. This can be significant
performance hit on startup when LaunchedURLClassLoader and there are a
lot of nested jars.
