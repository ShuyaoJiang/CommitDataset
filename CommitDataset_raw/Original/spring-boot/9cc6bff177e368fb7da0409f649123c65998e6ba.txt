Increase priority of EndpointHandlerMapping

The Actuator endpoints ought to take precedence over others (since
they are important and users can isolate them using management.contextPath
if necessary). This change puts the @Order at -100 (well before the default
order of the RequestMappingHandlerMapping at 0).

Fixes gh-1107
