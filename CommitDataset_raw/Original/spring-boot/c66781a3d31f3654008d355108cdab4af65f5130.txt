Set using collection copies when possible

Update `Map` and `Collection` binders to create a copy of the existing
collection whenever possible. Prior to this commit the binder would
always mutate the existing value and then call the setter with the
same instance. This could cause issues if the setter expected a
different instance.

Fixes gh-12322
