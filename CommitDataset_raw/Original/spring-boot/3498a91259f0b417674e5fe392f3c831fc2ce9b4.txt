Close Database to reset Connection's auto commit property

Previously, LiquibaseEndpoint closed the JdbcConnection but did not
close the Database. When using a connection pool, this could leave the
underlying SQL Connection with its auto commit property set to false.

This commit updates LiquibaseEndpoint to close the Database. This
ensures that it resets that Connection's auto commit property to the
value that it had when the Database was configured to use the
Connection.
