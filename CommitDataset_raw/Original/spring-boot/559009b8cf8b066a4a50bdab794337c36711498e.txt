Support for random ports in @IntegrationTest

User can now set up default properties in the Environment using
@IntegrationTest("foo:bar", "x:y") etc. Using "server.port:0" you
can get Tomcat or Jetty to spin up on a random port. We also add
a test listener that populates "local.server.port" with the actual
port the server started on so you can @Value("${local.server.port}")
inject it into the test case.

See gh-607 (this should make the extension of that PR to samples
much easier)
