Remove freemarkerConfiguration bean

Remove `freemarkerConfiguration` from the FreeMarkerAutoConfiguration
since it should not be needed for most applications.

The previous code also caused problems since it included a
@ConditionalOnBean annotation on a bean that was created in the same
configuration.
