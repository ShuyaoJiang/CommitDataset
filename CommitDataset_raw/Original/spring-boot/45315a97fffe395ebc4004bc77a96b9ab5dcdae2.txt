Prevent accidental failure of deployed war when management.port is set

We can't support (yet) embedded containers inside a deployed war (class
loader conflicts are inevitable, really). Until we figure out a way to
do it, we should just log a warning and advise the user to switch to
JMX for the actuator endpoints.
