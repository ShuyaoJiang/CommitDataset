Include "trace" info in whitelabel error views

This commit shows the stacktrace information in default WhiteLabel error
views for Spring MVC and Spring WebFlux.

This information is only shown if it is present in the model map, which
depends on the `server.error.include-stacktrace` configuration property.

Closes gh-12838
