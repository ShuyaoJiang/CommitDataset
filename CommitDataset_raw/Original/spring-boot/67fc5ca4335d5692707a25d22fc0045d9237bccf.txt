Create a public API to bind a ConfigurationProperties object

Previously, the API used to bind a ConfigurationProperties annotated
object was private to the BeanPostProcessor implementation.

This commit moves most of the logic to ConfigurationPropertiesBinder. As
we want this object to have the same state regardless of how it is built,
a builder is now provided that detects the components that the binder
needs if not specified explicitly.

Closes gh-8344
