Support customization of CacheManager

This commit allows to customize the auto-configured `CacheManager` by
exposing a bean of type `CacheManagerCustomizer`. The implementation may
reference the type of a `CacheManager` to determine in which case it has
to be invoked.

Several implementations can be provided and ordered using the regular
`Ordered` interface and `@Order` annotation.

Closes gh-5039
