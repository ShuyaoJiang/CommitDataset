Fix WebDriver lifecycle issues

Update WebDriver support to ensure that the `.quit()` method is called
after each test method runs and that a new WebDriver instance is
injected each time.

Support is provided by introducing a new `Scope` which is applied by
a ContextCustomizerFactory and reset by a TestExecutionListener.

Fixes gh-6641
