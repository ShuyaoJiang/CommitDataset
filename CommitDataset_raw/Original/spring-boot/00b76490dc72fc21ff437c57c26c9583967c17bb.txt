Remove error logging on ClientAbortException

Update `ErrorPageFilter` so that a Tomcat `ClientAbortException` no
longer causes "Cannot forward to error page for request" logging for
committed responses. Since a `ClientAbortException` indicates that the
client is no longer available it's of no consequence that the request
has been committed and the forward will fail.
