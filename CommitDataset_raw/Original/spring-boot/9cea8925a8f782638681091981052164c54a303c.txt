Use @AliasFor in @SpringApplicationConfiguration

Spring Framework 4.2 introduces first-class support for explicit
annotation attribute overrides via a new @AliasFor annotation.

In order to avoid potential naming conflicts in the future and to make
the current, implicit attribute overrides explicit (as well as
documented), this commit retrofits @SpringApplicationConfiguration with
@AliasFor.
