Make it easier to customize auto-configured Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder

Previously, it was difficult to customize the auto-configured
Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder. Typically, use of a bean post processor
was required.

This commit introduces Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilderCustomizer. Beans
that implement this interfaces are called during creation of the
auto-configured Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder, providing an opportunity
to customize its configuration.

Closes gh-5803
