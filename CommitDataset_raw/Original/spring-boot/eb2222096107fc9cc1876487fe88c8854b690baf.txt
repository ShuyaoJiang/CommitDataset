Upgrade to hibernate-validator 5.3.4

Upgrade to `hibernate-validator` 5.3.4 and introduce a new
`MessageInterpolatorFactory` that creates a suitable
`MessageInterpolator` (taking into account missing EL dependencies).

Rework `ConfigurationPropertiesBindingPostProcessor` and
`ValidationAutoConfiguration` to make use of the new factory.

Fixes gh-7598
