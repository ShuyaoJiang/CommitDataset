Add support for Spring HATEOAS hypermedia in Actuator endpoints

If spring-hateoas is on the classpath and an MvcEndpoint returns a
@ResponseBody it will be extended and wrapped into a Resource with links.
All the existing endpoints that return sensible JSON data can be extended
this way (i.e. not /logfile). The HAL browser will also be added as an
endpoint if available on the classpath. Finally, asciidocs for the
Actuator endpoints are available as a separate jar file, which if
included in an app will also generate a new (HTTP) endpoint.

Fixes gh-1390
