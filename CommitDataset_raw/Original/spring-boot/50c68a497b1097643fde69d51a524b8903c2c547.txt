Improve startup error message

This commit improves the startup error message so that it does not
reference  `--debug` anymore. Such command-line switch only works when
the application is started using `java -jar`.

The error message now refers directly to a section of the documentation
that provides more details and links to more useful examples.

Closes gh-6593
