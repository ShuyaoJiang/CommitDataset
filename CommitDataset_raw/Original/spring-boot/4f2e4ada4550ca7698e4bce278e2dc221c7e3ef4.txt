Introduce the foundations of the new endpoint infrastructure

This commit introduces a new annotation-based programming model for
implementing endpoints. An endpoint is identified by a type-level
`@Endpoint` annotation. Method-level `@ReadOperation` and
`@WriteOperation` are used to identify methods on an endpoint class
that implement an operation and should be exposed (via JMX for
exmaple) to remote clients.
