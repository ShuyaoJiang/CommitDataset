Ensure that ErrorPageFilter handles errors during async dispatch

Previously, the ErrorPageFilter was not invoked for async dispatches.
This meant that an error that was set during an async dispatch would
go undetected and a 200 response with an empty body would be returned.

This commit updates ErrorPageFilter to configure its
OncePerRequestFilter so that async dispatches are filtered and the
correct error handling is performed.
