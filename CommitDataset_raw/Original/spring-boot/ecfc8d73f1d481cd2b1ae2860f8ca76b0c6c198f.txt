Be defensive when clearing caches for restart

Update `Restarter` to be much more defensive when attempting to clear
caches. We now use `clearCache()` methods whenever possible, and only
fall back to field access when absolutely necessary. In addition field
access now ignore any exceptions.

Fixes gh-12719
