Add ApplicationArguments and ApplicationRunner

Add ApplicationArguments interface which allows SpringApplication.run
arguments to be injected into any bean. The interface provides access
to both the raw String[] arguments and also provides some convenience
methods to access the parsed 'option' and 'non-option' arguments.

A new ApplicationRunner interface has also been added which is
similar to the existing CommandLineRunner.

Fixes gh-1990
