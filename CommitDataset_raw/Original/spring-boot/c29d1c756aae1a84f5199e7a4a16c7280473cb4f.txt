Handle possible regexes defensively in NamePatternFilter

Previously, if a name contained part of a regex but wasn't actually
a regex, a PatternSyntaxException would be thrown and the request
would fail.

This commit updates NamePatternFilter to catch PatternSyntaxException
and treat the regex-like input as a name insteead.
