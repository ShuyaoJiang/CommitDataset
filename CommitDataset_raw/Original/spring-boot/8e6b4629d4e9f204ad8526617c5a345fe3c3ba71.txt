Tolerate AuthenticationSwitchUserEvent with null target user

When Spring Security is misconfigured it's possible to switch from an anonymous user
to a normal user. When switching back again, the corresponding
AuthenticationSwitchUserEvent will have a null target user. Previously, Actuator's
AuthenticationAuditListener would throw a NullPointerException when it received such an
event.

This commit updates the audit listener to defensively handled events with a null target
user.

Closes gh-15767
