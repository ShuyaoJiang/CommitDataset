Use spring.velocity.charset for template encoding

Previously `spring.velocity.charset` only controlled the output encoding
with the templates being loaded with the default encoding. We now
consistently set the same value for both the input and output encodings.

It is still possible to override it to a different value using
`spring.velocity.properties.input.encoding`

Closes gh-3994
