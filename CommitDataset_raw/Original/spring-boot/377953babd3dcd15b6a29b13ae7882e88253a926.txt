Upgrade to Hibernate Validator 5.0.2

Update Hibernate Validator dependency to 5.0.2 and also include
Tomcat Jasper dependency. Jasper is required as it provides the
default ExpressionFactory implementation class
(org.apache.el.ExpressionFactoryImpl) which is indirectly
instantiated by Hibernate Validator.

Fixes gh-173
