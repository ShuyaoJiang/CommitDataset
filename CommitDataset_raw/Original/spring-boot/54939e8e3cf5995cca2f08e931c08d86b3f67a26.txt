Start a reactive web application if necessary

This commit makes sure that `@SpringBootTest` with a reactive setup
starts a web application if necessary.

If both a servlet and a reactive environment are available, a servlet
environment is bootstraped. This commit also adds a way to force a
reactive environment by specifying the `spring.main.web-application-type`
property of the test (e.g. `@TestPropertySource`).

Closes gh-8383
