Add support for @WebFilter, @WebListener, @WebServlet

This commit adds a new annotation, @ServletComponentScan, that can be
used to enable scanning for @WebFilter, @WebListener, and @WebServlet
annotated classes. Registration beans will be automatically created for
any classes that are found, with the configuration derived from the
annotation.
