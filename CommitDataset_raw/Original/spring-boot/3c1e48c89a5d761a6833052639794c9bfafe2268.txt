Better handling of anonymously accessible endpoints

Shares the /health endpoint request mapping between security config
and MVC dispatcher. Generalizes so that instead of a marker
interface (AnonymouslyAccessibleMvcEndpoint), an MvcEndpoint
signals that it wants to control its own access rules by adding
a Principal to the @RequestMapping method parameters (more @MVC).

Fixes gh-2015 slightly differently
