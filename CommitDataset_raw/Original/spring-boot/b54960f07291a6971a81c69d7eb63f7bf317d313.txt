Management Security uses Spring Realm

Previously ManagementSecurityAutoConfiguration used Spring Security's
default realm of "Realm" when authentication failed. This was confusing
because when prompted for authentication (i.e. no credentials provided)
the realm "Spring" was requested.

This commit ensures the Realm that is used is consistent for all of of the
security auto configuration.

Fixes #2466
