[bs-59] Add zip packaging for cli module

* Also added "spring" shell script (in zip), so you can
unzip it and run out of the box
* To run in developer mode use SPRING_HOME, e.g.

        $ cd spring-bootstrap-cli
        $ SPRING_HOME=target src/main/scripts/spring run samples/web.groovy
* Also added "clean" command to remove spring bootstrap grapes
(useful to force a refresh of snapshot jars)
