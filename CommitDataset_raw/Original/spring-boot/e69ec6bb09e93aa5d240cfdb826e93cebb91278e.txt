Log classpath once environment has been prepared

Previously, the classpath would be logged in response to the
ApplicationStartedEvent. At this point, logging could be disabled
while the logging system is being initialized, or because the
log levels configured in the environment have not yet been applied.

This commit moves the logging to happen in response to an
ApplicationEnvironmentPreparedEvent by which point the logging
system has been initialized and its levels have been configured.

Closes gh-5313
