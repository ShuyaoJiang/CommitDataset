Add detection of default config classes to SpringApplicationConfiguration

I guess this didn't get done before because of the legacy structure of the
class hierarchy of TestContextLoaders. It makes sense that we should just prefer
netsted @Configuration though, so that's what this change does.

Fixes gh-271
