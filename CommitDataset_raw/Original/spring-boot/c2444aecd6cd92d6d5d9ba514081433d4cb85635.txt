Continue with default location if CONFIG_LOGGING fails

Tomcat in particular sets an environment variable in it's shell scripts
that people commonly use to start the container. So if people deploy a war
file to a stock Tomcat server they can't override the logging config, even
with the default location. With this change at least that should work
(for logback and log4j anyway). Tested with logback.
