Unify ServerProperties X-Forwarded-For support

Add a new `server.use-forward-headers` property which can be used to
switch on X-Forwarded-For header support in all supported embedded
servlet containers.

This commit reverts the decision to enable `RemoteIpValve` with Tomcat
by default (gh-3782) and requires that either `user-forward-headers` is
set to true or that `server.tomcat.protocol-header` or
`server.tomcat.remote-ip-header` are set.
