Rework JSR-303 validation exposure with Spring MVC

This commit improves the initial solution by actually overriding the
`mvcValidator` `@Bean`. This gives us more control as whether a custom
validator has been specified or not. We now wrap it regardless of it
being custom or provided by auto-configuration.

Closes gh-8223
