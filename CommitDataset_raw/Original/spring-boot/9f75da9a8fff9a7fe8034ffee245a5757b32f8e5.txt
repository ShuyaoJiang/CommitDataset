Simplify the Actuator's hypermedia support

This commit replaces the Acuator's support for hypermedia with a
single endpoint that returns HAL-formatted links to all of the
available endpoints. This is done without requiring Spring HATEOAS
to be on the classpath in a similar manner to the existing
CloudFoundry discovery endpoint.

Closes gh-9901
