Align Hibernate 5 join table names with those from SpringNamingStrategy

Previously, the name of a join table when using Hibernate 5 would
differ from those when using Hibernate 4 with the default
SpringNamingStrategy.

This commit introduces SpringImplicitNamingStrategy which customises the
name of join tables to match those produced by SpringNamingStrategy.

Closes gh-5880
