Apply Log4J2LoggingSystem.FILTER to main config

Update Log4J2LoggingSystem so that the FILTER is applied to the main
configuration and not to the root logger. Prior to this commit calls
to `logger.isErrorEnabled()` would not consider the filter and hence
would always return `true`. This caused `SpringApplication` to silently
swallow exceptions.

Fixes gh-5271
