Re-order security auto configuration so the fallback can be applied

The management security autoconfiguration wanted to come last in the chain
but that won't suit the fallback that was already in place for gh-568. This
change re-orders the autoconfig so that @EnableWebSecurity is still added
if the user sets security.basic.enabled=false and includes the actuator
endpoints.

Fixes gh-568
