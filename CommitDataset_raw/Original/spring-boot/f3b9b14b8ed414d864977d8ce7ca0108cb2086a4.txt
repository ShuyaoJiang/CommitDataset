Order ManagementContextConfiguration classes without loading them

Previously, ManagementContextConfiguration classes were loaded to
allow them to be ordered based on either @Order or implementing
Ordered. This had the unwanted side-effect of possibly logging
unwanted INFO messages if the reflection-based annotation
introspection failed. One cause of this was @ConditionalOnClass when
the referenced class was not on the classpath.

This commit uses the ASM-based annotation metadata reading to
determine the order of a management context configuration class based
on the @Order annotation. The classes are then sorted using a standard
OrderComparator. Note that Ordering via implemented Ordered is not
supported as it cannot be determine without loading the class.
