Improve failure diagnostics for messing Bean Validation provider

When the bean validation API is on the class path, but there is no
provider available, the stack trace that results is pretty much
useless. All the user needs to know is that the have the Bean
Validation API on the class path and that they should also add
an implementation, such as Hibernate Validator, if they want to
use validation.

This commit introduces a FailureAnalyser for ValidationException,
that returns a FailureAnalysis when the ValidationException is a
result of the situation described above.

Closes gh-5332
