Prevent reverse name lookup when configuring Jetty's address

Previously, the host on Jetty's connector was configured using the
host address of the InetSocketAddress. This could result in reverse
name resolution that could cause Jetty to bind to a different IP
address than was configured.

This commit updates the configuration code to use the host string
when specifically does not perform reverse name resolution.
