Fix same name configuration properties adapting

Update `SpringConfigurationPropertySources` adapter logic so that and
exact instance match is used when checking if the cache can be used.

Prior to this commit if a property source was replaced with one that
had exactly the same name, the adapted version would not change.

Fixes gh-12451
