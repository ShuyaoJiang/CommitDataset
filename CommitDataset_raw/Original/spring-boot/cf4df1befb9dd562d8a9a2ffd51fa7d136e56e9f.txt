Improve Mongo auto-configuration

Disable Mongo auto-configuation when @EnableMongoRepositories is used
and adapt the test helper classes accordingly.

Change the property prefix and dependency management version property
from `...mongo` to `...mongodb` for consistency with Spring Data.

Fixes gh-315
