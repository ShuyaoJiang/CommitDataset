Drop jumping into shell when running without args

Change SpringCli so that running without arguments no longer jumps into
the embedded REPL shell. This restores the ability to obtain quick usage
help by simply typing `spring` from the command prompt.

Windows users or developers that prefer the embedded shell can still
launch it using `spring shell`.
