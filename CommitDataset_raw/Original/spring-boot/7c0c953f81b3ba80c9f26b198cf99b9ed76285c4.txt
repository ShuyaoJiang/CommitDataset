Add value alias for SpringApplicationConfiguration

Given that Spring Boot uses java config accross the board, a new `value`
attribute is now aliased to the existing `classes` attribute such that
one could write the following:

@SpringApplicationConfiguration(MyConfig.class)
public class MyTest {}

Closes gh-3635
