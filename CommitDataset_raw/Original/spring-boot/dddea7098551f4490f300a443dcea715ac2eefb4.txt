Collect and display build information

This commit updates the Maven plugin to generate a
`META-INF/boot/build.properties` file with various build-specific
settings (group, artifact, name, version and build time). Additionally,
the plugin can be configured to write an arbitrary number of additional
properties.

A new `BuildProperties` bean is automatically exposed when such a file is
present. If that bean is present, an `InfoContributor` is automatically
created to expose that information under the `build` key.

As for the git contributor, it is possible to only display the core
settings or everything using the `management.info.build.mode` property.

See gh-2559
