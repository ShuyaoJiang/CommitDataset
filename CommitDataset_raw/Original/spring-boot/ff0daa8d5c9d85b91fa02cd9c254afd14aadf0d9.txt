Use DelegatingFilterProxy for Spring Security

Update SecurityFilterAutoConfiguration to use a DelegatingFilterProxy
filter rather directly referencing the springSecurityFilterChain bean.

Using a DelegatingFilterProxy helps to prevent early initialization of
beans and makes Spring Security work in a similar to way to if were
installed in a regular WAR deployment.

Fixes gh-4154
