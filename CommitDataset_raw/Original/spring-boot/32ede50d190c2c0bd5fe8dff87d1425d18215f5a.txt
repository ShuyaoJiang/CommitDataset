Extract property sources from composite when binding

Often this change will not be important because you are binding to
a bean with strongly typed properties. A bean with a Map property,
on the other hand, won't oytherwise be able to reason about the
permitted keys so it will miss any non-enumerable property sources,
including composites whose nested sources are themselves enumerable.
