Add Restart auto-configuration

Add auto-configuration for application Restarts. Restarts are enabled
by default (when not running from a fat jar) and will be triggered when
any classpath folder changes.

The ClassPathRestartStrategy additional customization of when a full
restart is required. By default a PatternClassPathRestartStrategy with
patterns loaded from DeveloperToolsProperties.
