Improve Servlet, Filter, and EventListener configuration diagnostics

ServletContextInitializerBeans handles existing registration beans and
also creates initializers for existing Servlet, Filter, etc beans.
Debug logging has been added to this class to improve things in three
main areas:

 - Distinguish between existing registration beans and those that are
   created to wrap a Servlet or Filter bean
 - Provide information about the resource (configuration class or XML)
   that resulted in the creation of the bean
 - Log information about EventListeners
