Clean up the logging system later in context close processing

Previously, the logging system was cleaned up in response to the
root context's ContextClosedEvent being received. This event is
published early in a context's close processing. As a result, the
logging system is in cleaned up state while, for example, disposable
beans are being destroyed.

This commit reworks the logic that triggers logging system clean up
to use a disposable bean instead. Disposable beans are called in
reverse-registration order. The logging clean up bean is registered as
early as possible so that it should be the last disposable bean to
be called.

Closes gh-11676
