Size the ElementsParser based on expected number of elements

Previously, the ElementsParser would be created using its default
capacity of 6 even when parsing a String that is expected to
produce a single element.

This commit updates ConfigurationPropertyName to create an
ElementsParser with a capacity of 1 when parsing a String that should
contain only a single element.
