Stop setting org.jboss.logging.provider when using Logback

This fix for gh-1928 to address a problemw with Log4j was to set
a system property that forces JBoss Logging to use SLF4J. This has the
unwanted side-effect of crashing Glassfish. We no longer support Log4j
so gh-1928 is no longer a concern. However, you can shoot yourself in
the foot by having Logback and Log4j2 on the classpath in that
particular order, but the latter has to be without its
log4j-slf4j-impl module. At this point you don't get any warnings or
error output at startup, but JBoss Logging uses Log4j2 while
everything else uses SLF4J and Logback. As a result, any logging
that's performed through JBoss Logging is silently lost.

Given the problems caused by setting the system property, and the
contrived nature of the arrangement that's necessary to cause a
problem when the property isn't set, this commit updates
LogbackLoggingSystem so that the system property is no longer set.

Closes gh-8669
