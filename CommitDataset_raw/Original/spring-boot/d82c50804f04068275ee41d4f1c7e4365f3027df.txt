[bs-73] Tweak algorithm for detecting anonymous classes

Apparently an anonymous class in Groovy is no anonymous in the compiled code,
so we need another heuristic.  We now check for non-existence of public
constructors (if there are none then there's no point regsistering that
class with an application context).
