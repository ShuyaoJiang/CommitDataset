Ensure only bindable properties are reported in /configprops

Introspects the properties that are being exposed in the report
and only renders the ones that are a) convertible from String
and b) have a setter. That goes a long way to making it a bullet
proof generic renderer of any Java object that can be bound with
@ConfigurationProperties.
