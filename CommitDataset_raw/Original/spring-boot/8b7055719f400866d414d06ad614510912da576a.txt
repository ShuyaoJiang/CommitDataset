Move InMemoryMultiMetricRepository to a separate class

This commit moves the `MultiMetricRepository` implementation from
`InMemoryMetricRepository` to `InMemoryMultiMetricRepository`. Both
implementations can share the same underlying store (and are for backward
compatible reasons).

The side effect is that `reset` now works as expected for a group.

Closes gh-7687
