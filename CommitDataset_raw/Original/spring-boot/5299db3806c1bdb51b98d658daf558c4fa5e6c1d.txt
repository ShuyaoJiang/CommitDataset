Fix deadlock when calling LiveReloadServer.stop()

Update LiveReloadServer so that different synchronization blocks are
used for the sockets and connection lists. Prior to this commit calling
`LiveReloadServer.stop()` would always result in a 60 second delay since
`stop()` owned the monitor add `removeConnection()` (called from a
different thread) needs it to remove the active connection.

Fixes gh-7749
