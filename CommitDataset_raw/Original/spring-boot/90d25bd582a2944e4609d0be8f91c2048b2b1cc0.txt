Use Set (again) for enumerating MvcEndpoints

This reverts a change that I assume was orphaned from work in
progress to address #1353, but is no longer needed. Anyway
there is no reason to restrict MvcEndpoints to be unique by
path since they can declare their own @RequestMappings
(and if there are duplicates they will be detected when those
are scanned).

Fixes gh-1911
