Expose context hierarchy in beans endpoint

Previously, the beans endpoint would only expose the context that
contained the endpoint. This commit updates the endpoint so that
the context that contains the endpoint and all of its ancestors are
exposed.

In a context hierarhcy, the relation ship is child -> parent and there
is no way to navigate from a parent to a child. As a result, any
contexts that are descendants of the context containing the endpoint
are not exposed.

Closes gh-5188
