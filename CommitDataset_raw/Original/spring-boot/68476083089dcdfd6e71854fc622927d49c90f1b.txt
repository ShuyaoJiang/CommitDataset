Merge branch '1.2.x'

In addition to the changes already made in 1.2.x, this commit updates
the tests in spring-boot-actuator to ensure that any Elasticsearch
data files are written into the target directory. This avoids problems
when switching branches caused by different versions of Elasticsearch
trying to read the files.
