Make log4j-core available to Elasticsearch tests

Elasticsearch server requires log4j-core but we don't want the entire
module to have a test dependency on log4j-core as it already uses
Logback. This commit uses the modified class path runner to make
log4j-core available specifically to the Elasticsearch-related tests.
