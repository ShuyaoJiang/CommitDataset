Replace use of deprecated JdkVersion API by looking for presence of classes

This commit updates ConditionalOnJava to remove a dependency on the
deprecated JdkVersion API from Spring Framework. In its place it now
looks for the presence of certain classes to determine the version of
Java on which its running.

Closes gh-4005
