Cache /health response irrespective of sensitivity and security

Previously, the response from /health was not cached if the request
was secure, i.e. the user has authenticated, or the endpoint was
configured as not being sensitive. 

The commit updates HealthMvcEndpoint to apply the caching logic
all the time. Users that do not want caching can disable it by 
configuring the TTL with a value of zero.

Closes gh-2630
