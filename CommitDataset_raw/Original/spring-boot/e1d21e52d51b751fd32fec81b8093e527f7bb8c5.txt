Allow multi-value spring.profiles properties

Update `ConfigFileApplicationListener` to correctly load properties
that have `spring.profiles` values containing a list.

Prior to this commit the loaded would attempt to add the same document
twice resulting in a "property source cannot be added relative to
itself" error.

Closes gh-13362
