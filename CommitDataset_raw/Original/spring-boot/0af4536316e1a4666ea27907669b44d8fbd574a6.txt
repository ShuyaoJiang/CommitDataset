Ensure media types are used consistently across endpoint mappings

Previously, the media types that are consumed and produced by
endpoints were configured in the web stack-specific configuration.
Furthermore, these configured media types were not used for the
discovery "endpoint" that links to all the available endpoints.

This commit introduces EndpointMediaTypes that is configred in a
single, central location and then used to configure the consumed and
produced media types for endpoints exposed via WebFlux, Web MVC, and
Jersey as well as the discovery "endpoint" provided by each.

Closes gh-10659
