Make cycle clearer in bean currently in creation failure analysis

Note: the fully-qualified references to @Configuration in some of the
test configuration classes are required to work around a bug in javac.
1.8.0_102 (and earlier). Without them, compilation fails as it cannot
resolve the symbol despite the import statement and the unqualified
references working elsewhere in the same source file.

Closes gh-7056
