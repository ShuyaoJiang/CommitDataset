Use WebRequest rather than RequestAttributes in ErrorAttributes

This change aligns ErrorAttributes with ResponseEntityExceptionHandler
which takes a WebRequest as a parameter of its handleException method.
WebRequest extends RequestAttributes and provides access to much more
than just the request's attributes. For example request headers and
parameters are available from WebRequest.
