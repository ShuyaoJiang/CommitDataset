Prefer Jackson unless user explicity states preference for Gson

This commit rewords the changes made in d718a80 so that simply adding
Gson to the classpath isn't sufficient to stop Jackson being used
for HTTP JSON mapping. To use Gson, the user must now either remove
Jackson from the classpath (not an option if they also wish to use
the Actuator) or configure the spring.http.converters.preferred-mapper
property with a value gson.

Closes gh-2247
