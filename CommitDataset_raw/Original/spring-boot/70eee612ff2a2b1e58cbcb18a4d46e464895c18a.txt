Configure Tomcat to create upload targets

Previously, if the directory to which Tomcat would write a file upload did not exist
the upload attempt would fail and a 500 response would be returned to the client.
This could happen when, for example, Tomcat is using a temporary directory for file
uploads and tmpwatch has deleted the directory.

This commit configures Tomcat so that, during multipart request parsing, it will
automatically create the directory to which the parts will be written if it does not
already exist.

Closes gh-9616
