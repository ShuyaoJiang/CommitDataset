Add mainClassName to springBoot DSL in Gradle plugin

This commit introduces a new mainClassName property on the springBoot
DSL provided by the Gradle plugin. It can be used to explicitly
configure the mainClassName of the default bootRun, bootJar, and
bootWar tasks in a single place. Previously, the only mechanism
provided to do so was the mainClassName property that's only available
when the application plugin has been applied.

Closes gh-10623
