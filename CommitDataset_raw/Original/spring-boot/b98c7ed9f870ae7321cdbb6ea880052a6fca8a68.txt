Add InvalidConfigurationPropertyValueException

This commit adds a new exception type that denotes the value of a
configuration key is invalid, alongside a FailureAnalyzer that reports
a human-readable report when such exception is thrown on startup.

ResourceNotFoundException being a (useless) specialization of this new
exception, its usage has been refactored to use the more general
exception type.

Closes gh-10794
