Don't use @ComponentScan for default packages

Update the 'default' package used for @Entity and Repository scanning
to be the package of the class annotated with @EnableAutoConfiguration
rather than using @ComponentScan.

This allows JPA and Spring Data to be used without requiring component
scanning and also removes the confusion that could arise from reusing
the @ComponentScan annotation, which already has well defined semantics.

Fixes gh-200
