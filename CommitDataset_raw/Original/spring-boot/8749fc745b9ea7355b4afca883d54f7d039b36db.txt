Disallow all extensions in actuator endpoints (except .json)

Along with the recent change in Spring to use content-disposition
"inline" (which prevents the download), it also makes sense to limit
the extensions allowed by the actuator endpoints. Really there *is*
no extension for these endpoints, but since all of them explicitly
produce JSON we can add .json for browsers as a convenience in case
the app would otherwise choose to send XML.

Fixes gh-4402
