Do not expose servlet locations in WebFlux

The `spring.resources.static-locations` key (see `ResourceProperties`)
lists many locations by default, including `"classpath:/static"` and
`"/"`. The latter is about exposing resources located in the root
servlet location.

Reactive web applications don't depend on a Servlet-related
`ApplicationContext`/`ResourceLoader`, so `"/"` is then resolved as
`"classpath:/"`, which exposes the whole classpath.

To avoid such situations, the `GenericReactiveWebApplicationContext`
overrides the `getResourceByPath(String path)` method and always returns
non existent resources if the path starts with `"/"`.

Fixes gh-8485
