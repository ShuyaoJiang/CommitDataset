Make sure that RabbitMQ metrics are configured early

The ConnectionFactory can be used early in user configuration to
configure an `Exchange`. Such connection may not hold the proper
MetricCollector and can be cached, leading to missed metrics
information.

This commit moves the configuration of RabbitMQ metrics to a
BeanPostProcessor so that the proper MetricCollector is configured
before any connection is created.

Closes gh-12855
