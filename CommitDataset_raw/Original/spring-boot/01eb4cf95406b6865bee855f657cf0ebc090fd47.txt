Rework breaking API changes

This commit changes the new mode-based configuration to use two new
methods â€“ setBannerMode on SpringApplication and bannerMode on
SpringApplicationBuilder. The old methods, setShowBanner and
showBanner on SpringApplication and SpringApplicationBuilder
respectively, have been reinstated and deprecated.

Closes gh-4001
