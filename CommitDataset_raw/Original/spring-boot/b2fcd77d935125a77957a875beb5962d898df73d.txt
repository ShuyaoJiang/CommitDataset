Rework EndpointWebMvcAutoConfiguration port logic

Update the `ManagementServerPort` detection logic to attempt direct
property resolution before looking for a local property bean
definition. Bean definitions provided by auto-configuration classes
are ignored.

This change allow `OnManagementMvcCondition` to use the
`ManagementServerPort` to determine when `EndpointWebMvcConfiguration`
should apply (removing the need to create a temporary context).
