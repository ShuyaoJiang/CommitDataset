Add `include` support to @EnableAutoConfiguration

Update the `@EnableAutoConfiguration` annotation to include an `include`
attribute which can be used to specify specific auto-configuration
classes.

Primarily added to so that tests can selectively auto-configure without
needing to worry about class import order.

Fixes gh-3660
