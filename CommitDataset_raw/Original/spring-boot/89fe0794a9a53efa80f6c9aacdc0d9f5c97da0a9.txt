Switch RequestContextListener to Filter

Update WebMvcAutoConfiguration to use a RequestContextFilter instead of
a RequestContextListener.

Using a filter is required for some Spring Session operations (see
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-session/issues/129).

This update also has the added benefit of allowing the Response to be
accessed from RequestContextHolder.getRequestAttributes() by casting it
to ServletRequestAttributes.

Fixes gh-2637
