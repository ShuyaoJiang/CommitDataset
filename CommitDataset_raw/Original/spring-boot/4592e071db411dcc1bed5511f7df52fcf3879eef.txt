Add support for making endpoints accessible via JMX

This commit adds support to the new endpoint infrastructure for
exposing endpoint operations via JMX. It also introduces support for
JMX-specific extensions to a general-purpose endpoint. Such an
extension is identified by the `@JmxEndpointExtension` annotation.
