Remove misleading setters from ConfigurationPropertiesBindingPostProcessor

Previously, ConfigurationPropertiesBindingPostProcessor had a number
of setter methods that implied that its configuration was more mutable
than it actually is and would only have an effect when called early
on in the post-processor's lifecycle.

This commit clarifies how the post-processor can be configured by
removing the misleading setters.

Closes gh-10598
