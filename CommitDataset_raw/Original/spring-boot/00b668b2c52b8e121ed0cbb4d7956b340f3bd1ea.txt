Only clean up logging system when root application context is closed

Previously, LoggingApplicationListener would clean up the logging
system in response to any application context with which it was
registered being closed. This caused problems when a child context was
closed. Specifically, closing the child context would cause any
SLF4J-based logging systems to unregister the JUL bridge handler
preventing an JUL logging being bridged into Logback or Log4J2.

This commit updates LoggingApplicationListener so that the logging
system is only cleaned up when a root application context is
closed.

Closes gh-4651
