Add generic error handling to BasicErrorController

Since Spring supports gobal error handling through
@ControllerAdvice, it is quite easy to set up more meta-data
about an exception for the BasicErrorController. You need
to be careful not to swallow Security exceptions, and probably
others (optionally) so this feature needs a bit more work.
