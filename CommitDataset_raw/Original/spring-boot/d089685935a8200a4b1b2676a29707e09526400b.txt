Add auto configuration for Spring 4.1 JMS features

This commit adds two additional auto-configuration items that are new
in Spring 4.1

* A JmsMessagingTemplate is automatically created if none is present
* A default JmsListenerContainerFactory is automatically created if
  @EnableJms has been triggered and no default has been set manually

Fixes gh-1298
