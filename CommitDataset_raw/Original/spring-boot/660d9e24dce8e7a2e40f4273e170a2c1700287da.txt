Add servlet path to /error if it is customized

In addition I added some convenience methods to ServerProperties
(servletMapping() and servletPrefix()) for manipulating the
servlet path as provided by the user (e.g. normalizing it into
a valid Servlet mapping path for the DispatcherServlet).

Fixes gh-939, see also gh-936
