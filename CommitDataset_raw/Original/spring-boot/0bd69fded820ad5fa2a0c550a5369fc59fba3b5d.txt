Fix detection of ScheduledExecutorService

`@EnableScheduling` detects primarily a suitable `TaskScheduler` in the
context and fallbacks to the presence of a `ScheduledExecutorService` if
that is not the case.

This commit improves the auto-configuration to back off when such
scheduled executor service is present, so that the framework
initialization code can pick it up as usual.

Closes gh-15032
