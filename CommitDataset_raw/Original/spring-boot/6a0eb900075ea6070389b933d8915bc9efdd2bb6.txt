Upgrade to Spring Batch 3.0.1

Due to a mistake in Spring Batch 3.0.0 it has been necessary to
introduce a breaking API change (the addition of
BatchConfigurer.getJobExplorer()) in the 3.0.1 release. This commit
updates Boot to use 3.0.1 and modifies the Batch auto-configuration
and associated tests to implement the new method.
