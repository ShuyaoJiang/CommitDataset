Restore original TCCL in PropertiesLauncherTests

Calling launch of PropertiesLauncherTests sets the thread context
class loader to an instance of LaunchedURLClassLoader. To avoid this
class loader being used beyond the scope of the test and launcher
that created it, this commit updates PropertiesLauncherTests to
capture the TCCL before each test and restore it after each test.

Closes gh-9378
