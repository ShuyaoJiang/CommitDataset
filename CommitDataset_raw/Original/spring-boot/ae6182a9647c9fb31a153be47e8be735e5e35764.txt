Update requiresUnpack documentation of unpack location

The unpack location is (largely) an implementation detail and the
Repackage Mojo was the only place where it was explicity documented.
Rather than updating the outdated location, this commit removes it
entirely to avoid encouraging people to rely on the location.

Closes gh-6624
