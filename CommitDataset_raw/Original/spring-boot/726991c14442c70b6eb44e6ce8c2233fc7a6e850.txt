Use an embed HornetQ broker by default

This commit changes the default behavior of the HornetQ auto
configuration. Prior to this commit, an embedded broker was only
started when it was requested explicitly by a configuration option.

This is inconsistent with the ActiveMQ support and boot favors the
easiest route. If the necessary classes are available, HornetQ is
embedded in the application by default.

Fixes gh-1029
