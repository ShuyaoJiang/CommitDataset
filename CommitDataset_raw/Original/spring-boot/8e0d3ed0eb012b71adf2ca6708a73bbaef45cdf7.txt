Donâ€™t return 404 when metric or env regex matches entry with null value

Previously, if a regular expression was used when calling the metrics or
environment endpoints, a metric or property with a null value would
result in a 404 response.

This commit updates the two affected endpoints so that any metric or
property whose name matches the regular expression but has a null value
is ignored. This allows all of the matching metrics or properties with
non-null values to be returned in a 200 OK response.

Closes gh-4552
