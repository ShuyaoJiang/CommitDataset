Fix for empty datasource-name in metrics

If there is more than one DataSource and the non-primary bean-name is
'datasource' an incorrect metric name is chosen.

The metrics are named datasource.active and not datasource.xxx.active. To
avoid this, the shortening of the bean-name only occurs if the bean-name
is longer than 'datasource'.
