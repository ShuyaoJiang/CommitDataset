Add ApplicationConversionService and fix binder

Create a new `ApplicationConversionService` similar in design to the
DefaultFormattingConversionService from Spring Framework. The new
conversion service provides a central place for custom conversion logic
supported by Spring Boot.

Also replace the `BindingConversionService` with an internal
`BindConverter` class that now invokes the `SimpleTypeConverter`
directly. Binding for `@ConfigurationProperties` has been updated so
that any custom property editors registered with the BeanFactory can
be used.

Fixes gh-12095
