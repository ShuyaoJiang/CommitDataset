Improve error reporting when driver class version is unsupported

ClassUtils.isPresent(String, ClassLoader) swallows all Throwables when
trying to load a class by name. For this reason
UnsupportedClassVersionError will also be swallowed when user code is
trying to use a driver library which has been compiled with a later
JDK than the one the application is running with. All the user would

see was "Cannot load driver class". This change simply propagates the
UnsupportedClassVersionNumberError so that it is easier for users to
find the root cause of the problem.
