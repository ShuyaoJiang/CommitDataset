Broaden LoggingApplicationListener ignores

Update `LoggingApplicationListener` to ignore all `-D` prefixed
property values. As well as catching the Azure use-case, this update
now means Spring Boot application can start when Tomcat is missing
`CATALINA_BASE\conf\logging.properties` and sets the value `-Dnop`.

Closes gh-7639
