Update DevTools' ResourceLoader to delegate to user's custom loader

Previously, when DevTools' was used it would set the application
context's ResourceLoader and overwrite any custom ResourceLoader that
had been configured. On the rare occasion when the user had customized
the ResourceLoader this meant that the customization was lost and
certain resources would become unavailable.

This commit updates DevTools' ResourceLoader to delegate a custom
ResourceLoader if one has been configured. If one has not been
configured it delegates as before, i.e. to
WebApplicationContextResourceLoader for web applications and to
DefaultResourceLoader for all others apps.

Closes gh-8010
