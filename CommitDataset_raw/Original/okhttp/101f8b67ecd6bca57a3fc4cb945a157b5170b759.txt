Fix flaky CallTest.recoverWhenRetryOnConnectionFailureIsTrue_HTTP2

MockWebServer sometimes enforces the DISCONNECT_AFTER_REQUEST policy before the client executes exchange.finishRequest(). As a result, Http2Writer.flush() is called on a closed Http2Writer and throws. This causes a RequestFailed event to be emitted instead of the expected ResponseFailed.

This change enforces the de-facto sequence in most runs, where the policy is applied only after the client finishes writing the request.
