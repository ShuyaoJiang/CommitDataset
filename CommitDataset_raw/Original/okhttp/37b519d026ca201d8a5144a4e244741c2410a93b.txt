Drop the benchmarks module

Most of the things it's exercising are obsolete (old versions of Netty
and Apache HTTP), it's missing important alternatives (cronet, Jetty),
and Caliper has backwards-incompatible API changes.

I think it's better for us to delete this and possibly start fresh
in the future. Possibly in a separate standalone project.
