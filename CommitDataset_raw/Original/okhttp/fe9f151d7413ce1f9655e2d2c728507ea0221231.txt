Split ConnectionPool API from implementation

Our 'Internal' trampoline really gets in the way with this one. Just
move the actual implementation code into its own type so there isn't
as much indirection.

Unfortunately we can't easily make RealConnectionPool extend from
ConnectionPool because otherwise we'd be open to any user-provided
connection pools and our API isn't that complete yet.
