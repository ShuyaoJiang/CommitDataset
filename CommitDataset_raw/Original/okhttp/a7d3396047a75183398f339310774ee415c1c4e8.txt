Teach OkHttp to lookup the X509TrustManagerFactory.

Right now there's problems with our ability to confirm certificate pins with
root certificates because we don't actually know which certificate authority
was used.

This unblocks that work.

This code is particularly fragile and gross. There's no API to get the
TrustManager from an SSLSocketFactory. We can potentially change the way
that we compute the initial SSLSocketFactory, but this approach is most
general.

This is motivated by https://github.com/square/okhttp/issues/1699
