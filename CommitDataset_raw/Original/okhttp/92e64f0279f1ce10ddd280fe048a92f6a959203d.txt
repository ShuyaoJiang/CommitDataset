Partially revert connection timeout behavior

Related to issue #1790.

If there is a *connection* timeout the next route should
be tried. Timeouts during a request/response should
probably not be retried.

The timeout/interrupt behavior was changed in PR #1257
for issue #1146. This modified both connection and
request/response behavior. The issue reported was actually
about the use of Thread.interrupt(), not timeouts, but the
behavior change modified both behavior for interrupt and
timeout.

PR #1388 split the handling of exceptions so that separate
code now handles connection errors from that which handles
request/response errors. It faithfully kept the behavior
from PR #1257.

The modification of the timeout behavior during *connection*
caused problems on Android. Now that the two types of error
handling are split it's possible to deal with them
differently and return the connection behavior to trying
the next route. This does not modify behavior during
request/response.
