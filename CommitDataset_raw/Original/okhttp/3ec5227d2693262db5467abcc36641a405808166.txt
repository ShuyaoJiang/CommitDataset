Don't crash reading non-ASCII characters from the server or the cache.

This doesn't completely support ISO-8859-1 headers; instead they will most likely
be mangled when they are decoded as UTF-8. If we decide we absolutely must support
ISO-8859-1 here we can do that in another change. (I'm not currently enthusiastic
about this idea.)

But this does prevent OkHttp from crashing when it encounters non-ASCII characters
in headers for HTTP/2, SPDY, and cached responses.
