Recover more gracefully when an editor is detached.

We had a bug where we could have two editors for the same entry. This
would occur when the cache was cleared, or if the entry was otherwise
evicted while the edit was in progress.

Previously the two editors would corrupt each other, and potentially
the cache's size. With this change the detached editor is limited and
harmless.
