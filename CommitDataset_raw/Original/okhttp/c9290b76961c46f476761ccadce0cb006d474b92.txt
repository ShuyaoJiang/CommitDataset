Recover from REFUSED_STREAM errors in HTTP/2.

This implements the following policy:

 - If a REFUSED_STREAM error is received, OkHttp will retry the same stream
   on the same socket 1x.
 - If any other error is received, or an additional REFUSED_STREAM error is
   received, OkHttp will retry on a different route if one exists.

We may want to follow up by going through HTTP/2 error codes and deciding
a per-code retry policy, but this should be good enough for now.
