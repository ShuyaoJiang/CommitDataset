Fix for issue #1589: Vary caching on Android

Keep the embedded OkHttp on Android working with Vary headers:

Vary headers were broken with android.net.http.HttpResponseCache:
the OkHttp caching requires a networkResponse to check the vary
headers and it was not being provided, leading to a
NullPointerException. Further changes were needed to actually
retain the request headers needed for the vary check itself.

Support for other stacks using the RequestCache has been
dropped for requests that include Vary headers.

To avoid regressions the existing ResponseCacheTest has been
changed to use the real cache. Previously, the use of
InMemoryResponseCache was hiding the Vary problem.

The ResponseCacheTest is now run with an AndroidShimResponseCache
to prove the tests work with real cases. The case without the shim
is covered with the CacheTest. ResponseCacheTest has been updated
to include many tests from CacheTest that were missing.

Switching the test to a real cache revealed a problem in the
JavaApiConverter and bad headers, which has been fixed by
making Headers.Builder.addLenient(String, String) accessible.
