Make the MockWebServer tests more Android compatible.

There are a few cases in OkHttp where API calls don't exist on
Android, but this is one that we can work around with any loss
of understanding.

The same test also behaves differently on Android due to
differences between the OpenJDK and Android's
HttpURLConnection implementation.

See issue #1824.
