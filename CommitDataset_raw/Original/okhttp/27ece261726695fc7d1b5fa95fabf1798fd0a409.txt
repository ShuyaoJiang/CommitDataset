Fix Connection sharing across equivalent OkHttpClients

Fixes https://github.com/square/okhttp/issues/2757

The OkHttpClient(Builder) constructor and both overloads of
OkHttpClient.Builder.sslSocketFactory() set a new CertificateChainCleaner
instance on the OkHttpClient.

Before this CL, CertificateChainCleaner, CertificatePinner and
TrustRootIndex used object rather than value identity semantics. This
caused Address.equals() to not recognize when addresses were equivalent,
which broke connection pooling across OkHttpClient instances.

This CL changes CertificateChainClaner, CertificatePinner and
TrustRootIndex to use value equality by overriding equals() and hashCode().

CertificatePinner.pins and BasicTrustRootIndex.subjectToCaCerts's values
have changed from List to Set because their order shouldn't matter.
This CL uses LinkedHashSet, although HashSet should also work.
