Refactoring: Make RouteSelector independent of Connection

Ultimate goal: to improve the TLS fallback behavior so that
socket connections will not be created if the necessary
TLS protocols will not be supported.

To achieve this RouteSelector will be moved into Connection
and so that it can be passed the Socket or protocol information
during the route selection process.

This is a small first step: Make RouteSelector independent
of Connection so that it can later be moved inside of
Connection. It puts the RouteSelector interface in terms
of Routes, which seems logical.
