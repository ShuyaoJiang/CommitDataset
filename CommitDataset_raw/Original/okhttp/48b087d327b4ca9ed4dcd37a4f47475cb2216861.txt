Be strict and careful when parsing the response status line.

The current status line parsing is lenient and sloppy; a
holdover from an ancient version of this library. The new
code is strict and provides a helpful message if a bogus
status line is encountered.

To make this possible the RawHeaders class needs a hint
about whether it's looking for a request line (from an
HTTP request) or a status line (from an HTTP response).
The old sloppy code used the same APIs for both.
