Stop returning HTTP/1.0 from Connection.getProtocol().

This was updating the protocol as a side-effect of an HTTP/1.0 response.
This made the protocol field mutable, and the code more difficult to
trace.

One consequence of this change is that OkHttp will attempt HTTP/1.1 for
all requests, even if a server returns HTTP/1.0 from the first response.
This is closer to our implementation anyway.
