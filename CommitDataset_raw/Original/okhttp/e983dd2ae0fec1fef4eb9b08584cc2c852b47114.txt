HeldCertificate: a cert and its private key

This class has been in MockWebServer for a long time, but it's always been
in the internal package with an incomplete API. This change promotes it to
a public API.

It's not quite sufficient for use as-is; we also need to open source its
companion class 'SslClient' that represents who we trust (as a list of
root certificates) and who we are (as an optional held certificate plus
the chain to a root certificate).
