Connection coalescing

As described here:

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-9.1.1

When the following is true
- HTTP/2 so we don't overload non multiplexed connections.
- HTTPS since we need subjectAltNames (n.b. RFC 7540 defines as safe to use over plaintext, based purely on DNS).
- Desired url host is part of the subjectAltNames for an existing connection.
- One of the DNS results for desired host match the established connection.
- HostnameVerifier is *not* overridden.
- ConnectionPinner accepts the existing certificate chain.

From https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-9.1.1

> A server that does not wish clients to reuse connections can indicate
> that it is not authoritative for a request by sending a 421
> (Misdirected Request) status code in response to the request (see
> Section 9.1.2).
