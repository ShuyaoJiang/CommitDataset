Fix HTTP/2 bug where we were using SPDY/3 style header concatenation.

When multiple headers have the same value in SPDY/3, they are concantenated
and separated by \u0000.

When multiple headers have the same value in HTTP/2, they are each written
independently.

This fixes the problem and rearranges the code to share less behavior than
previously. It gets us closer to being able to drop SPDY/3.
