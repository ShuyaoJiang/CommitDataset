Promote sent and received timestamps to fields on Response.

I'm currently keeping these as longs. That's easy an unambiguous, but it also
feels rather primitive.

This was more work than I expected, but it doesn't seem particularly risky.
It's also potentially more efficient, since there's fewer places where we're
converting from string to long and vice versa.
