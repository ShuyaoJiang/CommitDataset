Retain interrupted state when throwing InterruptedIOException

The drawbacks seem small; the callsite needs to handle interruption anyway
because the thread is prone to interruption.

And the upside is that a single interrupt should now be sufficient to break
out an in-flight OkHttp call.

Note that although we're fixing this, thread interruption is not well tested
in OkHttp. Most users should prefer Call.cancel(), which is well tested and
doesn't rely on the caller to know which threads OkHttp is using to make
the actual HTTP request.
