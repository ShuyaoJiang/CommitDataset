Make DistinguishedNameParserTest pass

Change test expectations so that the test passes; no attempt was made
to verify whether the new test expectations are more correct than the
old ones. The purpose of this test is to ensure that any future
behavior changes are deliberate.

The expectations that this CL changes relate to invalid characters
('<', '>') and to the handling of surrounding whitespace.

Additional changes:
 - replaced "String... expected" argument to assertCns() with
   a nullable String expected since all but the first argument
   is now unused. Reordered the arguments to list expected
   first, consistent with common JUnit style.
 - renamed methods to follow JUnit 4 style and removed reference
   to "Cns" since only a single CN is now parsed.
 - moved some assertions from regularCases() into emptyValues()
   and trailingWhitespace() where those seemed like a better fit.
 - dropped a test comment that didn't seem to make sense (any more)
 - removed additional dead sections.
