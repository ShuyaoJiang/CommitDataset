OkHttpsURLConnection.setSSLSocketFactory(null): throw.

OkHttpsURLConnection extends javax.net.ssl.HttpsURLConnection.
The super class documentation says that setSSLSocketFactory(null)
throws IllegalArgumentException, but this implementation didn't
do that.

This CL fixed OkHttpsURLConnection.setSSLSocketFactory(null) to
throw, as specified.

Test: not done locally, relying on Travis.
