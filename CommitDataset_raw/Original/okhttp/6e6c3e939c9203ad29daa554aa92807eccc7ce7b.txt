Squashed commit of the following:

make the DiskLruCache's initialize() public through the Cache interface

The DiskLruCacheâ€™s cache does lazy initialization. The time spent in
initialization varies depending on the actual cache size and journal
file size.

On very low end device, the initialization time could be as long as
1000 ms once the cache reaches 100M for example on a 4.0 device. This
has significant performance impact on the very 1st cache hit.

So the proposed solution is to give the developer an opportunity to
explicitly do the initialization early on and in a back ground thread.
Without this change, the developer would have to call any method from
the Cache class to warm up the cache implicitly.
