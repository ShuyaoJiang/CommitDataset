New API to break platform-specific dependencies.

In particular:
 - Don't require OkHttp to depend on Jetty's non-boot package for
   Android. This was causing ugly, confidence-smashing dalvik
   errors in Android apps.
 - Don't prevent HTTP on Java6 just because SPDY isn't available.

This uses gross reflection and dynamic proxies! That's sad, but
it's encapsulated so users won't have to know it exists.
