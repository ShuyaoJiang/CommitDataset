Port DistinguishedNameParserTest from AOSP

This is ported from http://r.android.com/183814 with only minor
modifications in order to make the test compile and conform to
OkHttp code style:
 - use of @Test rather than JUnit 3 TestCase
 - two-spaces indent
 - commented out use of API that does not exist in OkHttp's
   DistinguishedNameParser

Changes to make the test pass are left to a follow-up commit.
