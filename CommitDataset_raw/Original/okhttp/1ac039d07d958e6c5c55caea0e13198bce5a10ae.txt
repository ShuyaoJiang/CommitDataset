Some initial URL test cases.

It turns out that even the spec that tries to describe how browsers actually
work doesn't completely accomplish that. So I'm trying to reconcile differences
between Firefox, Chrome and the WHATWG spec. In some cases I get three different
behaviors.

This adds tests for some interesting cases.
