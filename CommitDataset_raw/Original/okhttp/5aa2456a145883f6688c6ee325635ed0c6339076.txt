Fix TLS requiresTunnel which was being computed incorrectly.

We were only returning 'true' once we were already in a tunnel.
This was bogus. In theory a TLS tunnel sending extra data could
be corrupted due to this bug.

Also migrate one of the TLS tunnel tests to use SslContextBuilder
instead of TestSSLContext.
