Let CipherSuites have arbitrary names.

This allows Handshake to accept CipherSuite names that do not have a
corresponding predefined instance in CipherSuite.java, including ones
that conscrypt uses today or might use in future.

The following OkHttp 3 APIs are not changed by this CL:

 - ConnectionSpec still uses Strings to represent CipherSuites for now.

 - CipherSuites are interned (value equality is based on object
   equality) in order to not break clients that use ==.

This CL does introduce these API and behavioral changes:
 - CipherSuite instances constructed via CipherSuite.forJavaName("TLS_" + s)
   will now always be different from CipherSuite.forJavaName("SSL_" + s)
   for all possible values of s. Previously, there were 19 specific
   values of s for which those would have yielded equal instances.
 - Since CipherSuite is no longer an enum, it no longer extends Enum,
   no longer has name() or valueOf() methods, and no longer implements
   Serializable.
