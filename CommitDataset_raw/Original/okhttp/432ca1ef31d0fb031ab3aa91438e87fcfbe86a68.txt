Reduce flakiness and document reasons for flakiness

Android has been receiving reports of some tests being flaky
on what are probably lower-spec devices.

This introduces delays into tests where sockets are being
poisoned after the entire response body has been written to
them *and* where there are follow-up requests.

This change also improves the documentation for the problematic
SocketPolicy values.
