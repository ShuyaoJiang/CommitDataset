A way to catch that cleartext HTTP request was attempted.

This makes the HTTP stack throw java.net.UnknownServiceException if
a request is attempted using a protocol which matches no configured
connection specs. For example, this will happen if a cleartext HTTP
request is attempted when ConnectionSpec.CLEARTEXT is not configured.

Fixes #1392
