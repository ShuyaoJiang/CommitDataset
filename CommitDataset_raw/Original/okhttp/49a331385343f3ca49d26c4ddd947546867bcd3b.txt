Connection allocations model.

This is intended to replace some of the state machines in HttpConnection, HttpEngine,
and ConnectionPool. With this we'll keep track of all streams in flight, not just
the connections currently idle.

Note that I've sketched this out into a new Connection.java class. In a follow up
change I'll attempt to combine this with the existing Connection class.
