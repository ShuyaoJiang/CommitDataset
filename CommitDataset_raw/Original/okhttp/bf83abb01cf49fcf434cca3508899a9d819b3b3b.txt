Forbid null for a handshake's TLS version.

This value is almost always non-null. The only exception is when it was
persisted by a version of OkHttp prior to 3.0.

Rather than accepting null, and forcing clients to handle that value,
I'm changing the API to reject null. I'm forcing a default of SSL_3_0
for responses that we don't have a version for. I don't anticipate this
causing problems in practice.
