Defer StreamResetException until response body buffer is fully read.

We rely on the application layer to read the response body buffer
before sending WINDOW_UPDATE's. Previously we'd immediately throw a
StreamResetException. This prevented the application layer from reading
the buffer which in turn means we would not send WINDOW_UPDATE's. This
has potential to deplete the flow-control window.
