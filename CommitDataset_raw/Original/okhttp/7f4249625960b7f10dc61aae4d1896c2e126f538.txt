Discard streams once they're no longer open.

This avoids a memory leak; we don't hold onto the input stream
and it's large 64 KiB buffer long after that stream is done.

It also allows SpdyConnection to track how many streams are
currently active. This will allow a follow up change to shut
down connections that don't host any streams.
