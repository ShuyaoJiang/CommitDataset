Initial import.

This is a fork of okhttp from http://code.google.com/p/okhttp.
I'm moving it to Github since that's where my code reviewers
are. I've renamed the core package from com.google.okhttp to
com.squareup.okhttp because Square is where I expect ongoing
development of this project to take place.

All code in this project is subject to be contributed upstream
to AOSP. In particular, all code in the libcore package is
derived from AOSP and intended to be contributed back to AOSP
on an ongoing basis.
