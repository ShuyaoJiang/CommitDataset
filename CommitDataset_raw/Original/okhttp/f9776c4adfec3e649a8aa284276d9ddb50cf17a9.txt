Drop Request.uri(). Just use Request.url().uri().

There's a mostly-academic corner case on URLs like http://host/%xx that
have a malformed escape sequence. This changes the exceptions on those
URLs from checked to unchecked.

I think we may want a separate change to HttpUrl to fix those URLs to
be encoded as http://host/%25xx which avoids the problem altogether.
