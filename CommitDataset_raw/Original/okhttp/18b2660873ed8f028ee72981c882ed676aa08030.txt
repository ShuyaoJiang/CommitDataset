New CertificateAuthorityCouncil class to normalize certificate chains.

The goal of this is to get the root CA certificate into the certificate
chain, so that it can be considered by the certificate pinner. The work
to integrate CertificateAuthorityCouncil with CertificatePinner will
come in a follow-up PR.
