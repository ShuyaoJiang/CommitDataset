Strict, modern HostnameVerifier.

This brings OkHostnameVerifier up to date with the intersection of
RFC 2818 and Baseline Requirements, and adds support for absolute
domain names.

The changes are:
* Absolute domain names are supported. All presented hostnames are
  treated as absolute domain names. All domain names in server
  certificates are treated as absolute domain names as well.
* Wildcard character (*) is permitted only in the left-most domain
  name label and must be the only character in that label. For
  example, *.example.com is permitted, while *a.example.com,
  a*.example.com, a*b.example.com, a.*.example.com are not permitted.
* Wildcard character (*) must match exactly one domain name label.
  For example, *.example.com matches www.example.com, but does not
  match example.com or www.test.example.com.
* Wildcard pattern cannot mach single-label domain names: * and *.
  patterns are rejected.

This is a cherry-pick of the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) change
