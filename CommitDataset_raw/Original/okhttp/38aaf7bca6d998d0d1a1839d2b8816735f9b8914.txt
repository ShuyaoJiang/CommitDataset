Turn IncomingStreamHandler into FramedConnection.Listener.

Add a callback invoked on settings changes. The concurrency here
is a little awkward because the calls into the listener are not
serialized.

This is going to be used in a follow up change to keep the
connection's allocation limit in sync.
