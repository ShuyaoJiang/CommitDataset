Fix canonicalization of IPv6 addresses in HttpUrl

Per RFC 5952, section 4.2.2, a single 16-bit field must not be shortened.
Improper canonicalization can break TLS hostname verification because
the canonicalized name will not match the server certificate.

This change adds the examples from the RFC to the tests.
