Source-incompatible: ResponseBody methods throw IOException

This is a binary-compatible change, but code that currently calls
ResponseBody [contentLength()|byteStream()|source()|charStream()]
that doesn't necessarily catch or declare IOException will need
to with this change.

These methods could be performing I/O (opening streams, etc.).
Throwing IOException seems reasonable in this case.

contentType() and charset() have not been changed.
