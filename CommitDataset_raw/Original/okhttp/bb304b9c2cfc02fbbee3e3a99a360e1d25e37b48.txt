Log gzipped bodies when HttpLoggingInterceptor is used as a NetworkInterceptor (#3792)

* (in-progress) Support gzipped bodies as a networkInterceptor

* Fixed buffer cloning, added test for a still-unsupported encoding (Brotli)

* Avoid try-with-resources and too-long lines to appease build checks

* Fixed method name typo

* Added suggested comma between byte and gzipped-byte count

* Account for added comma in test

* Use buffer.writeAll to ensure all body content is read

* Indentation consistency

* Added test to confirm response body remains valid
