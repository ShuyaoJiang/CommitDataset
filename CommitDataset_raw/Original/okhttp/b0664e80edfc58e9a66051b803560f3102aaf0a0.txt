Throw UnknownHostException not IllegalArgumentException for bad host chars

Before this change HttpURLConnection would parse the bad ASCII
characters like \u0001, but fail when setting them in the host
header.

After this change HttpURLConnection throws UnknownHostException.
Earlier versions of OkHttp would escape the bad characters, but
this behavior has not been retained.

Fix for issue #1833.

This change involves a behavior change for HttpUrl, and consequently
HttpURLConnectionImpl.
