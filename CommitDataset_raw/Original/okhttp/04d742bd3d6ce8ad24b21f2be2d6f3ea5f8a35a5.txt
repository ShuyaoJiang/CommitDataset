Improve connection reuse.

Instead of trying to read the last bytes of a content body
when the input stream is read, do it when the connection is
closed. This approach is less elegant, since it requires
a connection to do work on behalf of a potentially nonexistent
follow up connection. But it should result in more reuse in
practice.
