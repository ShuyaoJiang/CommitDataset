Move TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 to COMPATIBLE_TLS.

We no longer connect to TLSv1.0 or TLSv1.1 servers out-of-the-box; instead
it is necessary to enable COMPATIBLE_TLS in the OkHttpClient configuration.

This is in the path to later removing these TLS versions completely; that
is scheduled for March 2020 by some browsers.
