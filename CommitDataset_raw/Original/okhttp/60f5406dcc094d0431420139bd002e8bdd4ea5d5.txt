Move TLS retries / fallback into Connection.

API changes:
1) Added: Address.getCertificatePinner()
2) Incompatible API change: Address constructor no longer
includes ConnectionSpecs. Removed getConnectionSpecs().
3) Added: ConnectionSpec.isCompatible(SSLSocket)
4) Added: TlsVersion.javaName()

Implicit / semantic / internal changes:

1) Connection now handles all attempts to connect via a route
(effectively a {proxy, socket address} pair), rather than just
one attempt. i.e. Connection now handles all the TLS negotiation
fallbacks internally.

2) Route no longer deals with TLS versions. Individual TLS
failures are not counted against a Route. If no connection
attempts to a route were successful the failure is counted
against the route.

3) The code makes a distinction between when various
IOExceptions occur, with the intention making retries a bit
smarter. It is now more obvious which exceptions happen during
setup (RequestException), connection (RouteException),
HTTP communication and thus which can be retried and whether
the request might have been sent.
