Cleanup refactoring: Move 3 methods into DelegatingHttpsURLConnection

These three methods were delegating to delegate; their implementation
was duplicated across both subclasses of DelegatingHttpsURLConnection.

This change moves them into the base class in order to
  - avoid duplication
  - separate the responsibility of delegation (base class) from the
    responsibility of change to behavior (subclasses).

Notes:
 - Since these three methods are not available in Java 6, each of
   these need a @IgnoreJRERequirement annotation to pass the
   animal sniffer test. This appears like it should have been
   necessary before but for some reason it used to pass without.
 - This in turn requires a new dependency from okhttp-urlconnection
   onto animal-sniffer-annotations. The dependency was added onto
   version 1.11 of that library (consistent with okhttp itself);
   okio depends on version 1.10, the latest version is 1.15.
