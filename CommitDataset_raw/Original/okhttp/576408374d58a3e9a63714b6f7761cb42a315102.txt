Begin to fold together parts of RealCall and HttpEngine.

Previously we had an awkward, arbitrary separation because RealCall contained
the stuff that wasn't in HttpURLConnection, and HttpEngine contained everything
that was shared.

It was also awkward because HttpEngine could be interrupted in various parts
of the HttpURLConnection flow: after connecting, while transmitting the request
body, etc. With this change we no longer need to handle API calls while we're
in these intermediate states, which means we can reduce the scope of certain
things from fields to local variables.

There's still a way to go here but this is more easy wins.
