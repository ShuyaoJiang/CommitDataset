Modify the way MockWebServer selects a host IP to bind to

On Android getByName(null) returns the first of
[IPv6 loopback, IPv4 loopback], binding the server to ::1.
The IPv6 loopback address returns "localhost". "localhost"
does not resolve to the IPv6 address.

Instead: explicitly select "localhost" ensuring
MockWebServer binds to an IP that can be looked up by name
and should also be a loopback address.
