A Pipe.

This is something we need to implement HttpURLConnection atop the native
OkHttp API. The application thread wants to be active, writing to its
OutputStream. But in OkHttp's API, this work wants to happen in the
RequestBody.writeTo() callback. To make this work we give the HttpUrlConnection
OutputStream the sink end of the pipe, and the RequestBody the source end
of the pipe. It's a bit of plumbing, but the benefit is that backpressure,
timeouts, and failures will propagate as expected.
