Whole operation timeouts

Strictly-speaking this change is backwards-incompatible because it adds
a new method to the Call interface. The method returns the call's timeout.

The trickiest part of this is signaling the end of the call, which
occurs after the last byte is consumed of the last follow up request,
or when the call fails. Fortunately this is made easier by borrowing
the sites used by EventListener, which already plots out where calls
end.
