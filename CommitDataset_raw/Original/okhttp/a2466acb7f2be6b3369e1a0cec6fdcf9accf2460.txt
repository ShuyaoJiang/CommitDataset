Make CertificateChainCleaner an abstract class.

This is working towards implementing a new CertificateChainCleaner that uses
X509TrustManagerExtensions on API 17+.

This also moves the two TrustRootIndex classes into the interface that
defines that API.

Unless I've overlooked something, this PR contains no behavior changes.
