TLSv1 supports TLS extensions so they should be enabled

Follow up to:
https://github.com/square/okhttp/pull/1196.

Combined with an NPN bug (18705877) on Android this is the
reason why fallback connections started failing on Android
after the COMPATIBLE_TLS was changed to be TLSv1.

[The NPN bug means that once enabled on a socket from an
SSLContext then NPN must be configured for every subsequent
socket otherwise some of the NPN state will still be set,
but some will be missing, leading to negotiation issues].

The implication of this change is that the follow up request
after a handshake failure may now be HTTP/2 or SPDY
(or HTTP/1.1). Previous to this change they would always
have been HTTP/1.1.

Previous to pull 1196 they would also have been
HTTP/1.1 because COMPATIBLE_TLS was SSLv3.
