Delete long-deprecated OkUrlFactory.

Some OkHttp behavior was only tested via this API, so this PR includes a bunch
of test migration. The test migration is as mechanical as possible, so we aren't
really using idiomatic APIs yet in these tests.

The `okhttp-urlconnection` survives for the JavaNetCookieJar and the
JavaNetAuthenticator. We can't remove these any time soon unfortunately.
