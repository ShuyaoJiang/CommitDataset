Fix some stream leaks.

There's a few places where OkHttp could leak a connection that needed to be
closed. With our new connection pool model this is easier to find. This fixes
two specific problems:
 - too many redirects doesn't release the last used connection
 - interceptors that throw runtime exceptions don't release the connection

There are likely more situations. I have hacked together a small little test
harness to make finding these leaks easier; that's not included in this PR.
