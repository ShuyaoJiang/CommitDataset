Add a test for interceptors throwing unchecked exceptions.

Our behavior here is not good. Right now it looks like we're leaking
resources; nothing is releasing the socket in a 'finally' clause when
interceptors crash. We're also not notifying the callback that the
call has failed; that's left hanging.

That said, we don't expect applications to recover from these
exceptions.
