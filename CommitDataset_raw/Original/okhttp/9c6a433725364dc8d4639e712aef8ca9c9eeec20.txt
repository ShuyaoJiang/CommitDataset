BufferedSource.

The Source API is nice for source implementors: no annoying
skip method, no annoying available() method, just one API to
supply bytes to the caller.

But it isn't as nice of an API for source callers. It lacks
convenient APIs!

This bridges the gap. Calling code should use BufferedSource,
and implementing code should implement Source.
