Migrate Request/Response + their body types to Kotlin (#4831)

* Rename Request.java -> Request.kt

* Rename RequestBody.java -> RequestBody.kt

* Rename Response.java -> Response.kt

* Rename ResponseBody.java -> ResponseBody.kt

* Convert Request to Kotlin

* Convert RequestBody to Kotlin

* Convert Response to Kotlin

* Convert ResponseBody to Kotlin

* Clean up package private usages in tests

* Use isDuplex() in HttpLoggingInterceptor

Apparently making this a function is a breaking change to kotlin consumers, and the previous "isDuplex" method was swizzled to a property accessor before

* Exclude Request/Response now-explicitly final methods from japi

The classes were final already, so this is a false positive

* Fix isSuccesful

* Make builders + funs open to match OkHttp3

* Clean up lazy usages to be more idiomatic

* Move boolean "is" properties back to vals to preserve API for both langs

This is also more idiomatic for kotlin anyway

* Use more idiomatic require checks

* Fix require null logic

* Un-backtick nulls

* Revert "Clean up lazy usages to be more idiomatic"

This reverts commit 4bb472ae5a5b94e816897191e10418ceac9d5bf1.

* Add missing braces
