OkHostnameVerifier: Don't fall back to CN verification. (#3764)

The use of Common Name was deprecated in RFC 2818 (May 2000), section 3.1:

  Although the use of the Common Name is existing practice, it is
  deprecated and Certification Authorities are encouraged to use the
  dNSName instead.

In 2017, Chrome 58, Firefox 48, and Opera 45 web browsers removed this
fallback, with Chrome leaving it configurable for enterprise deployments
(see https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/4981025180483584).
Android is removing it in http://r.android.com/581382 .
