Adjust CircleCI caching (#4866)

Master compile cache is built once a day by master compile job or each commit on master.
Each Test build uses a previous run on the same branch, or the Master compile cache.

Experience should generally be

PR: check and test jobs start immediately using the master build cache (or previous good run).
Master commit: Runs 3 test jobs which use master build cache. Compile updates the cache without growing.
Daily: All jobs run and Master compile cache is updated.
