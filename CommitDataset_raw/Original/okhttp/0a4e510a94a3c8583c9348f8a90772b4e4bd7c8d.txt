Source-incompatible: RequestBody.contentLength() throws IOException

This is a binary-compatible change, but code that currently calls
RequestBody.contentLength() doesn't necessarily catch or declare
IOException, and will need to with this change.

MultipartBuilder is most impacted by this change; previously the
length was computed eagerly; now it's not computed at all.
Applications that require the previous behavior should fully
buffer the request bodies and use that to compute the length.
