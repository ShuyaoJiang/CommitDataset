Let tests provide raw InputStream bodies.

Original AOSP change by Jeff Sharkey:
  This enables testing of large files, such as those beyond the 2GB
  boundary.  Also switches to streaming in MTU-sized chunks.

  Bug: 8209169

This modifies Jeff's change to permit empty bodies, and to remove the getBody() accessor. Since reading the body is now destructive, that accessor must be removed!
