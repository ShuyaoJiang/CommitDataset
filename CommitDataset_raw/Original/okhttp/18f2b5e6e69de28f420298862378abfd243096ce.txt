Fix source compatibility for some Kotlin callsites. (#4887)

We had a problem where boolean vals needed to be reverted back to
boolean funs. I'd like to go back to vals later, but supporting existing
source patterns is more important.

We also had a problem where single abstract method types (SAM types)
could be supplied as lambas when calling into Java but not when calling
into Kotlin.

I found these by pointing KotlinSourceCompatibilityTest at the OkHttp
