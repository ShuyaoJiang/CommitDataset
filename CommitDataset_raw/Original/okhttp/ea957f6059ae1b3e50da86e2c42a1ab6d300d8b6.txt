Fix connection leak if WebSocketListener.onOpen() throws

If WebSocketListener.onOpen() throws, failWebSocket() is responsible for releasing the allocated streams. Specifically it releases this.streams. Previously WebSocketListener.onOpen() was called after the streams were allocated but before they were assigned to this.streams. As a result the streams were not allocated if WebSocketListener.onOpen() threw.

Fixes part of https://github.com/square/okhttp/issues/4515.
