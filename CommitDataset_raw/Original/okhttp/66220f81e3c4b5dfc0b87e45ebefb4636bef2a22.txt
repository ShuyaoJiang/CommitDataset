Support Froyo.

This makes a bunch of sad changes for compatibility:
 - Using String.length() rather than String.isEmpty()
 - Using String.getBytes(String) rather than String.getBytes(Charset)
 - Using new String(..., String) rather than new String(..., Charset)
 - Avoiding TimeUnit.DAYS

I've tested this and the HTTP tests run perfectly fine on Froyo.
The HTTPS tests time out due to a bug in Froyo that prevents
its TLS library from working as a server. I manually verified
that TLS works as a client without problem.

I also tested this on Gingerbread. It passes all tests except
for testConnectViaHttpProxyToHttpsUsingProxySystemProperty, which
fails because of a bug in Gingerbread's java.net.ProxySelector.

This change introduces caching reflective objects for NPN access.
That'll make clients that make multiple SSL connections slightly
more efficient.
