Always build full chains with CertificateChainCleaner.

We had a bug on Android where the trust root index would return trusted
intermediate certificates when we called findTrustAnchorByIssuerAndSignature().
This would lead to a partial chain, which would fail the pin check
unnecessarily.

Also permit that method to return null, as it does when the certificate
is not trusted.
