Modify the cipher suite / TLS version selection behavior

Motivation 1: Cipher selection and TLS protocol version selection
should be performed over "enabled", not "support" values. Otherwise,
ciphers / protocols that are disabled by default are re-enabled.
Android would like to avoid enabling values that are considered unsafe
and are disabled by the platform, apps or GMS core.

Motivation 2: Opinionated cipher suite selection makes sense for
OkHttp when bundled with apps. OkHttp probably has the best/newest
information available when compared with the socket factory it
encounters.

However, with the Android platform usecase the socket factory (i.e.
one from the platform, from GMS core, or installed by the app) might
have better information (or reasons why specific suites should not be
used and so it modifies the "enabled" set). Android would therefore
prefer OkHttp to select from a default set specified by the socket
factory, not a list hard-coded at release time.

Unlike ciphers, for protocols there is no current need to
go with the default enabled set so supporting "null" / "use default"
is not required for protocols.

Other change:

The ConnectionSpec caching (see supportedSpec) has been removed from
ConnectionSpec. This seems like an risky optimization to me in an
environment where different SocketFactory instances could be encountered
and doing it properly seems costly and of limited benefit.
