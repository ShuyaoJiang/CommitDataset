Custom trust recipe.

To my great delight, Java and Android can read .pem files without
the BKS or JKS store files we typically use to distribute trusted
certificates.

This recipe includes a big copy-and-pasteable method for converting
an InputStream of PEM files into an SSLContext. The rest of it is
warnings about how dangerous that is.
