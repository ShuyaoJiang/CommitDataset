Fix formatting / parsing for Android

Ensuring that this Android bug is fixed for the next
Android release:
https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=66135

On Android the SimpleDateFormat for "zzz" returns GMT+00:00.
This is regrettable but awkward to change as it is existing
behavior.

This change fixes the format to 'GMT'.

This change also fixes a bug where the platform default
timezone was used for parsing some date/times and not GMT.

Various tests have been added to prove the behavior when
timezones are missing and dates are malformed.
