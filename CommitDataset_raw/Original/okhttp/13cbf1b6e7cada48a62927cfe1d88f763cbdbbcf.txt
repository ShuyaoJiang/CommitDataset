Update cipher suites to track Chrome 51 and Firefox 47.

I've updated the cipher suites spreadsheet to track rankings of the
cipher suites by client.

With this update we're adding support for the following cipher suites:

  * TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
  * TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
  * TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
    Recently added to Chrome.

  * TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
  * TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
    Recently added to Chrome and Firefox. Newly available in Android 7.0.

We're dropping support for the following cipher suites:

  * TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
    This isn't supported by recent versions of Firefox or Chrome.

  * TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
  * TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
    These two cipher suites were dropped by Chrome between v.46 and 51. They
    are still present in the current release of Firefox.

With this update TLS connections that work in Chrome 51 should work in OkHttp
and vice versa.
