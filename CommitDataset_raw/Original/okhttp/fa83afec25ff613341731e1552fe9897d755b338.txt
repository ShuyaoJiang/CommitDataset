Automatically ping the peer on a user-specified interval.

This changes RealWebSocket from using a shared ThreadPoolExecutor to
using a private ScheduledExecutorService. This make some of the code
simpler but it means that applications will hold 1 writer thread for
each websocket, even if it is mostly not writing.

Testing automatic pings is awkward. This refactors much of
RealWebSocketTest to make it more natural to reinitialize the
configuration.
