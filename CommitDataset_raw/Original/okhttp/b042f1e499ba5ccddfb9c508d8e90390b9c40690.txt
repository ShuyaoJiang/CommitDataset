Add Module.md files for different artifacts with module and package info (#4844)

* Add Module.md files for different artifacts with module and package info

This is what dokka uses to document packages and modules. Deleted the `package-info.kt` file as it doesn't do anything on its own, but can restore if it's still wanted

* Add Module.md for mockwebserver

* Only specify module if it exists

A bunch of samples don't have modules or readmes

* Remove package descriptors
