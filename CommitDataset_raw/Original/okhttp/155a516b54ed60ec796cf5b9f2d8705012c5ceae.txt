Upstream changes made directly to AOSP.

This change is a combination of 4 separate commits
to fix various bugs observed during android platform
testing.

--------------------------------------------
Allow certificate inspections after connect.

We don't have to wait for the request to be sent
before allowing inspection of SSL certs. They can be
inspected as soon as the connection is established.

Fixes CTS test UrlConnectionTest#testInspectSslAfterConnect

---------------------------------------------
Respect read timeout on recycled connections.

Partial fix for CTS test : URLConnectionTest#testGetKeepAlive.

https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/63782/
-----------------------------------
Fix HttpUrlConnection#isUsingProxy.

The earlier implementation disregarded what the
ProxySelector had to say. We now query the selected
route (if one has been established).

Fixes compatibility test:
HttpURLConnectionTest#testUsingProxySelector

--------------------------------------------
Don't support anything other than Basic auth.

We should disregard authentication schemes other than
"Basic" and let clients handle them themselves.

The java Authenticator API gives us a user name and
password combination, but we can't know how to format
that information for any scheme other than basic.

Historically:

The JB implementation responds to challenges from an
arbitrary scheme "X" by sending a header with scheme
"X" but formatted like the "Basic" scheme.

The current implementation responds to challenges from
an arbitrary scheme "X" by sending a header with scheme
"Basic" and formatter like the "Basic scheme".

Partial fix for test cases in URLConnectionTest:
- testAuthenticateWithCommaSeparatedAuthenticationMethods
- testAuthenticateWithMultipleAuthenticationHeaders
