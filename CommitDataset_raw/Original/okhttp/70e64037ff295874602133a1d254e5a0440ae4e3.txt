Prepare to promote HttpConnection + Pool to public API.

Giving the application code access to the connection pool
is tricky: it exposes more implementation details from
OkHttp; details that are quite inaccessible through the
conventional HttpURLConnection APIs. Currently the only
thing regular users get are a pair of awkward system
properties.

But exposing these should also be useful: it'll allow the
application to observe the pool (for performance monitoring)
and possibly also to directly manage it (by setting policy,
or to evict when the application is paused).
