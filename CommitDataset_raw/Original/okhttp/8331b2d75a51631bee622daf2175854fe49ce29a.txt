Fix RealConnection to guard allocationLimit by connectionPool.

I'm working towards making OkHttp limit itself to a single HTTP/2 connection
to a single host. In this work I found we're not sufficiently safe on
allocationLimit - connections are added to the pool when this is 0, and
the value is updated without any synchronization.

This change also reduces the visibility of some connection fields in
RealConnection and organizes the fields into two sets: those that are
immutable after connect and those that are guarded by connectionPool.
