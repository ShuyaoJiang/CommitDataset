Allow using a charset other than UTF-8 for creating urlencoded form bodies. (#3518)

* Allow using an encoding other than UTF-8 for creating urlencoded request form bodies.

This is useful when accessing a web server you don't control which receives form data
encoded in a charset other than UTF-8 (e.g. ISO-8859-1).

To use this you pass an encoding to FormBody.Builder constructor. The constructor is used so
it's clear you shouldn't switch encodings in the middle of building a form body.

The result is undefined is a character cannot be encoded in the specified charset (as the
result of Java's String.getBytes(charset) is also undefined in that case.

* Update HttpUrl.java
