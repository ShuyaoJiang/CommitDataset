Relay. This is a single entry in the upcoming DiskLruCache2.

At the moment there are some things still incomplete:
 - Timeouts. Not yet tested, and no great implementation plan.
 - Thread interrupts. This has been quite problematic for
   the original DiskLruCache. We should test and support this
   in Relay.
 - File system problems. If the host file system is full or not
   accepting writes, we should fallback gracefully. This may
   be difficult.
 - Metadata updates. At the moment the metadata is permanent
   and immutable.

That said, many nice features are already implemented:
 - Metadata and stream data in one file.
 - No locks held during file I/O or network I/O.
 - Read from the buffer, the file, or the socket in that order.
 - Reference counting on open sources. It is assumed that the
   creator of each Relay will take a source, and that guarantees
   that the count will always reach 0.
