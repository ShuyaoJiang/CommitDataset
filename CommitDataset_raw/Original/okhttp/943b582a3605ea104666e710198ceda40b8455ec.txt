Reduce memory requirements for MockWebServerTest.disconnectHalfway().

MockWebServer.readRequest() was accumulating the request body (1 GByte)
into an unbounded buffer held in memory. This caused the test to fail
with an OutOfMemoryError on low-memory devices. Due to the OOME, not
even a stacktrace was available.

This CL introduces setBodyLimit() to limit the amount of data held in
memory. Note that this is similar to the call to setBodyLimit(0) that
already exists in URLConnectionTest.veryLargeFixedLengthRequest().
