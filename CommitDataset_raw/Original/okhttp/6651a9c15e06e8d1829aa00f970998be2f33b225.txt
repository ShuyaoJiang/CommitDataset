Change MediaType's failure mode to not crash on charset problems.

As-is it throws unchecked exceptions on unexpected charsets. This is a problem
because it can cause a misbehaving webserver to crash the client.

I don't expect this to break existing clients; returning 'null' has always
been a possibility; it's just returned in more cases.
