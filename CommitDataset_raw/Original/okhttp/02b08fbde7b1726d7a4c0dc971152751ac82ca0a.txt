Allow HTAB in header values.

RFC 7230 section 3.2 allows HTAB ('\t', '\u0009') inside header
values as long as there is not more than one in a row:
  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2

Before this CL, OkHttp previously disallowed HTAB in header values.
This CL changes behavior to allow any number of consecutive HTABs
inside a header value; this is more permissive than the RFC, but
is consistent with how OkHttp currently treats space characters
(' ', '\u0020').
