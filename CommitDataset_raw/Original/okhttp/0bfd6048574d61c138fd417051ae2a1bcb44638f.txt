One authenticate method on the authenticator interface.

Instead of having one instance of Authenticator, and that interface
defines two methods, we now have two instances of Authenticator and
that interface defines one method.

This prevents leaking request-specific configuration (the authenticator)
into shared connection configuration (the proxy authenticator).
