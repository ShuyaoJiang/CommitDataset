Always pass a host to NetworkSecurityPolicy.isCleartextTrafficPermitted().

Previously we were misinterpretting which hosts this method applied to.
Suppose an Android app was configured to require TLS for bank.com and
not for any other address. The NetworkSecurityPolicy.isCleartextTrafficPermitted()
method would return false because cleartext traffic wasn't universally
permitted. And OkHttp would incorrectly forbid cleartext communication
to other hosts like puppies.com.
