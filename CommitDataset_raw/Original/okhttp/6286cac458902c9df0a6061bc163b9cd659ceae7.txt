Try to fix flaky InterceptorTest.connectTimeout

This tries to address https://github.com/square/okhttp/issues/4415.

I was unable to reproduce the flakiness locally to verify the fix, but I hope that removing dependency on an external network may resolve the issue.

The solution is inspired by https://gist.github.com/anthavio/5092439
