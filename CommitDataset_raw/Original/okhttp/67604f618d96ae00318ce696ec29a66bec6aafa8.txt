Clean up utility code for submission to AOSP.

This moves methods that will have Android-specific implementations
to Platform.java; all other utility methods are in a junk drawer
class called Utils.java.

This also moves method names (like "GET") to compare with .equals
instead of '=='. The old code took advantage of a hidden agreement
between HttpURLConnection and HttpEngine; with these in separate
projects that behavior isn't as obvious and shouldn't be relied
upon.
