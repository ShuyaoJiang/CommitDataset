PROPFIND redirects should maintain request body

the fact that all redirects strip the request body is somewhat unusual.
In WEBDAV the body contains restrictions such as the depth of how much
data you want to receive. Stripping this off will produce an unlimited
request with unlimited depth (where the initial request had depth 1).

- havent checked other WEBDAV methods though whether they require similar
  treatment.
