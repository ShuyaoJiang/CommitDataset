Fix connection recycling for TLS+gzip+chunked.

We had a bug where the underlying SSLInputStream always returned
0 for InputStream.available(). This prevented us from ever reading
the "end of stream" chunk, which prevented connection recycling.

Also fix a nearby bug where we were fast-forwarding the gzipped
stream when we should have been fast-forwarding the transfer
stream when we were preparing to recycle a connection.
