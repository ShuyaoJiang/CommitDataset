Be more careful about synchronization.

SpdyConnection needs to guard its own state separately from
the SpdyWriter, which permits slow blocking calls. Split these
into multiple independent locks.

Also use independent right-sized thread pools for reading (exactly
one thread all the time) delayed writing (0 or 1 threads) and
callbacks (any number of threads).
