Fail HTTP/2 connections if the pong is not received. (#3878)

This removes the Ping abstraction from our http2 package. This was written as
if it were a public API, but never exposed to any callers but tests. Removing
it makes it easier to lock down how pings are used.

This also removes the NullServer class, replacing it with a new SocketPolicy
on MockWebServer. The new SocketPolicy, STALL_SOCKET_AT_START, allows us to
do TLS and negotiate an HTTP/2 connection without actually building a proper
Http2Connection and without responding to pings.

The behavior in HTTP/2 connections is modeled after our behavior in web sockets.
We count outgoing pings, incoming pongs, and confirm that the pongs are keeping
up. If later we make this policy more sophisticated we can track the changes
in both places.
