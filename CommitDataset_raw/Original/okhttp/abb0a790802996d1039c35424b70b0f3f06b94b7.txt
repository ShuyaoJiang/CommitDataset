First step towards HTTP/2 automatic pings. (#3874)

This changes the executor services in HTTP/2 connection to split up
listener executors (of which there may be many threads) from writer
executors (of which there is one per connection).

This adds a scheduled executor job to send pings on an interval. We
don't yet fail the connection if pongs are not received.

For follow-up there's some work to remove exising APIs to send pings
through the HTTP/2 APIs. These are unused and make it awkard to
confirm that only the automatic pings are being replied to.
