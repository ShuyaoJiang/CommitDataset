Fix flakiness in CallTest.cancelTagImmediatelyAfterEnqueue()

There's a race where the HTTP engine has been created, but not yet connected
and the cancel isn't as immediate as it could be. Fix the test by making sure
there's a response to be retrieved.

With the upcoming connection pool changes we might make the implementation
more robust.
