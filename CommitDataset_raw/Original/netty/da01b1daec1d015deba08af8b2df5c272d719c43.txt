Decryption failed or bad mac record in Android 5.0

Motivation:

Android 5.0 (API version 21) has a bug which not correctly set the bytesConsumed of SSLEngineResult when HandshakeStatus is FINISHED.  Because of this we need to special handle the status and so workaround the Android bug.

Modifications:

- Break the unwrap for (;;) loop when HandshakeStatus is FINISHED and bytesConsumed == 0 && bytesProduced == 0.

Result:

SslHandler works with all known version of Android.
