[#3988] Correctly count acquired channels in FixedChannelPool

Motivation:

We missed to correctly count acquired channels in FixedChannelPool which could produce an assert error.

Modifications:

Only try to decrement acquired count if the channel was really acuired.

Result:

No more assert error possible.
