Fix incorrect port range check

Motivation:

In the Internet Protocol, the valid port number range is from 1 to 65535
(inclusive on the both side.)  However, SocksCmdRequest refuses to
construct itself when the port number 65535 is specified.

Modification:

Do not raise an exception when the specified port number is 65535.

Result:

Fixes #2428
