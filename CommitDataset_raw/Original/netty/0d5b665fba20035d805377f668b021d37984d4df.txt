Automatically decode DNS domain name to unicode

Motivation:

DnsNameResolver will return the domain / host name as ascii code using punycode (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3492). This is different to what the JDK does which always convert it to unicode. We should do the same by default but allow to also not do it.

Modifications:

- Add new builder method on DnsNameResolverBuilder which allow to disable / enable converting. Default is to convert just like the JDK does.
- Add unit tests for it.

Result:

DnsNameResolver and JDK impl behave the same way.
