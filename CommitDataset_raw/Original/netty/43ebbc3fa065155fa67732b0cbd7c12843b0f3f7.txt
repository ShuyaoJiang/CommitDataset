Update JDK SSL Tests to use SSL Context Builder.

Motivation:

Use new / non-deprecated APIs for creating SSL Context
in tests, in order to be able to implement OpenSsl
tests with maximum code reuse.

Modifications:

Use `SslContextBuilder.(forServer|forClient)` instead
of deprecated `JdkSslServerContext` constructor.
Use `ApplicationProtocolConfig` instead of Protocol
Negotiator.
Use custom exception type for skipping tests to avoid
swallowing exceptions arising from tests.

Result:

Exceptions from tests aren't swallowed.
Using new APIs allows reusing same test code for
OpenSsl tests.
