Add support for abstract domain sockets

Motivation:

Because of java custom UTF encoding, it was previously impossible to use
nul-bytes in domain socket names, which is required for abstract domain
sockets.

Modifications:

- Pass the encoded string byte array to the native code
- Modify native code accordingly to work with nul-bytes in the the
array.
- Move the string encoding to UTF-8 in java code.

Result:

Unix domain socket addresses will work properly if they contain nul-
bytes. Address encoding for these addresses changes from UTF-8-like to
real UTF-8.
