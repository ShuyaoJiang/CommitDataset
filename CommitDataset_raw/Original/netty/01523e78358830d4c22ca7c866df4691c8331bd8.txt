Reduce conditionals in AbstractReferenceCounted

Motivation:
AbstractReferenceCounted as independent conditional statements to check the bounds of the retain IllegalReferenceCountException condition. One of the exceptions also uses the incorrect increment.

Modifications:
- Combined independent conditional checks into 1 where possible
- Correct IllegalReferenceCountException with incorrect increment
- Remove the subtract to check for overflow and re-use the addition and check for overflow to remove 1 arithmetic operation (see http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.18.2)

Result:
AbstractReferenceCounted has less independent branch statements and more correct IllegalReferenceCountException. Compilation size of AbstractReferenceCounted.retain() is reduced from 58 bytes to 47 bytes.
