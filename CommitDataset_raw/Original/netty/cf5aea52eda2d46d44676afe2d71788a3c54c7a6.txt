Implemented LZMA frame encoder

Motivation:

LZMA compression algorithm has a very good compression ratio.

Modifications:

- Added `lzma-java` library which implements LZMA algorithm.
- Implemented LzmaFrameEncoder which extends MessageToByteEncoder and provides compression of outgoing messages.
- Added tests to verify the LzmaFrameEncoder and how it can compress data for the next uncompression using the original library.

Result:

LZMA encoder which can compress data using LZMA algorithm.
