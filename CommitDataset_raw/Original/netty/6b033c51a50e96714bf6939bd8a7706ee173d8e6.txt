Add 32 bytes overhead per header entry when calculating headers length in HPackDecoder

Motivation:

According to the HTTP/2 Spec:

SETTINGS_MAX_HEADER_LIST_SIZE (0x6): This advisory setting informs a
peer of the maximum size of header list that the sender is
prepared to accept, in octets. The value is based on the
uncompressed size of header fields, including the length of the
name and value in octets plus an overhead of 32 octets for each
header field.

We were accounting for the 32 bytes when encoding in HpackEncoder,
but not when decoding in HPackDecoder.

Modifications:

- Add 32 bytes to the header list length for each entry when decoding
with HPackDecoder.

Result:

- We account for the 32 bytes overhead by header entry in HPackDecoder
