Unit Test for SslHandler's handlerRemoved()

Motivation

SslHandler's handlerRemoved() is supposed to release the SSLEngine (which it does) but there is no Test for it to make sure it really happens and doesn't unexpectedly change in the future.

Modifications

Add a Unit Test that makes sure that SslHandler releases the SSLEngine when the Channel gets closed.

Result

Assurance that SslHandler will not leak (ReferenceCounted) SSLEngines.
