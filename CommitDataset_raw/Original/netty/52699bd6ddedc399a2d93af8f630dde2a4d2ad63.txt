Add test to verify that invalid ciphers are handled in all SSLEngine implementations correctly. (#8443)

Motivation:

https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/8442 reported that we fail to build a SslContext when an invalid cipher is used with netty-tcnative-boringssl-static, while it worked before. This test verifies that this is now consistent with all other SSLEngine implementations.

Modifications:

Add test-case to verify consistent behaviour

Result:

More tests to assert consistent behaviour across SSLEngine implementations
