Remove duplicated code in AcceptorChannel classes.

Motivation:

NioUdtByteAcceptorChannel and NioUdtMessageAcceptorChannel have almost same code.
For maintainability, it's better to remove it.

Motification:

- Pulled a member(METADATA) and methods(doReadMessage() and metadata() up.
- Added newConnectorChannel().

Result:

Cleaner code.
