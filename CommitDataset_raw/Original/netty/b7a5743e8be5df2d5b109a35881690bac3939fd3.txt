Return the correct Future from FixedChannelPool.release()

Motivation:

The behaviour of the FixedChannelPool.release was inconsistent with the
SimpleChannelPool implementation, in that given promise is returned.

In the FixedChannelPool implementation a new promise was return and
this meant that the completion of that promise can be different.
Specifically on releasing a channel to a closed pool, the parameter
promise is failed with an IllegalStateException but the returned one
will have been successful (as it was completed by call to super
.release)

Modification:

Return the given promise as the result of FixedChannelPool.release

Result:

Returned promise will reflect the result of the release operation.
