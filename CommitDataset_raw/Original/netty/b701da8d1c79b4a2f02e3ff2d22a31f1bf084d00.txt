HTTP/2 HPACK Integer Encoding Bugs

Motivation:
- Decoder#decodeULE128 has a bounds bug and cannot decode Integer.MAX_VALUE
- Decoder#decodeULE128 doesn't support values greater than can be represented with Java's int data type. This is a problem because there are cases that require at least unsigned 32 bits (max header table size).
- Decoder#decodeULE128 treats overflowing the data type and invalid input the same. This can be misleading when inspecting the error that is thrown.
- Encoder#encodeInteger doesn't support values greater than can be represented with Java's int data type. This is a problem because there are cases that require at least unsigned 32 bits (max header table size).

Modifications:
- Correct the above issues and add unit tests.

Result:
Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/6210.
