Correctly take position into account when wrap a ByteBuffer via ReadOnlyUnsafeDirectByteBuf

Motivation:

We did not correctly take the position into account when wrapping a ByteBuffer via ReadOnlyUnsafeDirectByteBuf as we obtained the memory address from the original ByteBuffer and not the slice we take.

Modifications:

- Correctly use the slice to obtain memory address.
- Add test case.

Result:

Fixes [#7565].
