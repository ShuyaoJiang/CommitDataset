DefaultChannelHandlerInvoker should work with non AbstractChannelHandlerContext sub-classes.

Motivation:

DefaultChannelHandlerInvoker currently blindly cast to AbstractChannelHandlerContext without checking if the ChannelHandlerContext is really a sub-type of it. It should check it first and if not just use slow-path implementation.

Modifications:

Do instanceof check first and if it fails just create a new Runnable instance of used the cached.

Result:

DefaultChannelHandlerInvoker works with any ChannelHandlerContext implementations.
