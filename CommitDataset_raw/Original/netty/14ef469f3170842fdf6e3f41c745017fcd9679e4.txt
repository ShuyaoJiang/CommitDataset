Use maven plugin to prevent API/ABI breakage as part of build process (#8904)


Motivation:

Netty is very widely used which can lead to a lot of pain when we break API / ABI. We should make use japicmp-maven-plugin during the build to verify we do not introduce breakage by mistake.

Modifications:

- Add japicmp-maven-plugin to the build process
- Fix a method signature change in HttpProxyHandler that was flagged as a possible problem.

Result:

Ensure no API/ABI breakage accour between releases.
