Expose the global direct memory counter. (#8945)


Motivation:
This counter is very useful in order to monitor Netty without having every ByteBufAllocator in the JVM

Modification:
Expose the value of DIRECT_MEMORY_COUNTER as we are already doing for DIRECT_MEMORY_LIMIT.
We are returning -1 in case that DIRECT_MEMORY_COUNTER is not available.

Result:

Be able to get the amount of direct memory used.
