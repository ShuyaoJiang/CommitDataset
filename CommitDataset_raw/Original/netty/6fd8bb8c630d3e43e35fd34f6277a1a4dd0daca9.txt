[#5763] DefaultEventLoopGroup doesn't expose ctor variant that accepts custom Executor

Motivation:

The DefaultEventLoopGroup class extends MultithreadEventExecutorGroup but doesn't expose the ctor variants that accept a custom Executor like NioEventLoopGroup and EpollEventLoopGroup do.

Modifications:

Add missing constructor.

Result:

Be able to use custom Executor with DefaultEventLoopGroup.
