Motivation:

It is generally useful to have origin http servers respond to
"expect: continue-100" as soon as possible but applications without a
HttpObjectAggregator in their pipelines must use boiler plate to do so.

Modifications:

Introduce the HttpServerExpectContinueHandler handler to make it easier.

Result:

Less boiler plate for http application authors.
