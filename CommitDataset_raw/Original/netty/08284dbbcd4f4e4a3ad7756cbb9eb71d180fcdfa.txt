Ensure we call promise.setUncancellable() before trying to process in DefaultHttp2StreamChannel.

Motivation:

We should call promise.setUncancellable() in DefaultHttp2StreamChannel.Unsafe impl to detect if the operation was cancelled.

Modifications:

Add promise.setUncancellable() calls

Result:

More correct handling of cancelled promises
