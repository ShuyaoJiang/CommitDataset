[#5386] DnsNameResolver does not resolve localhost on Windows

Motivation:

On Windows localhost is not in hosts file and the DNS server does not resolve this address either, i.e it is handled by the Windows API. So using a Bootstrap (among others) with the resolver based on DnsNameResolver will not resolve localhost.

Modifications:

Workaround behavior of Windows

Result:

Correctly resolve localhost on Windows when using DnsNameResolver
