Http2DefaultFrameWriter direct write instead of copy

Motivation:
The Http2DefaultFrameWriter copies all contents into a buffer (or uses a CompositeBuffer in 1 case) and then writes that buffer to the socket. There is an opportunity to avoid the copy operations and write directly to the socket.

Modifications:
- Http2DefaultFrameWriter should avoid copy operations where possible.
- The Http2FrameWriter interface should be clarified to indicate that ByteBuf objects will be released.

Result:
Hopefully less allocation/copy leads to memory and throughput performance benefit.
