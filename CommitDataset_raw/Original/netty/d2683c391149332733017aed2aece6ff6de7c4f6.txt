EPOLLRDHUP infinite loop

Motivation:
If  is enabled and a channel is half closed it is possible for the EPOLL event loop to get into an infinite loop by continuously being woken up on the EPOLLRDHUP event.

Modifications:
- Ensure that the EPOLLRDHUP event is unregistered for to prevent infinite loop.

Result:
1 less infinite loop.
