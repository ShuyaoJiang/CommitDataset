Support the usage of SocketOption when nio is used and the java versiâ€¦ (#8085)

* Support the usage of SocketOption when nio is used and the java version >= 7.

Motivation:

The JDK uses SocketOption since java7 to support configuration options on the underyling Channel. We should allow to create a ChannelOption from a given SocketOption if nio is used. This also allows us to expose the same featureset in terms of configuration as the java nio implementation does without any extra effort.

Modifications:

- Add NioChannelOption which allows to wrap an existing SocketOption which then can be applied to the nio transport.
- Add test-cases

Result:

Support the same configuration options as the JDK. Also fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/8072.
