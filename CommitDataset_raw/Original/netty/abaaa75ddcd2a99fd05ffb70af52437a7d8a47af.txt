Reduce the memory requirement of heap dump compression

Motivation:

The current heap dump compression preset (9) requires way too much
memory (768 MiB at maximum for dictionary), resulting in OOME in many
cases.

Modifications:

- Use the default preset (6) which uses 8 MiB dictionary.
- Do not fail abruptly even when OOME has been raised.

Result:

More stable heap dump acquisition
