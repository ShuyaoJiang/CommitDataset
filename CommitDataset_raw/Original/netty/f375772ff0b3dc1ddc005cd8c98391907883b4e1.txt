Remove OSGi import of JCTools since it is shaded.

Motivation:

Since netty shaded JCTools the OSGi manifest no longer is correct. It claims to
have an optional import "org.jctools.queues;resolution:=optional,org.jctools.qu
eues.atomic;resolution:=optional,org.jctools.util;resolution:=optional"
However since it is shaded, this is no longer true.
This was noticed when making JCTools a real bundle and netty resolved it as
optional import.

Modifications:

Modify the generated manifest by no longer analyzing org.jctools for imports.
A manual setting of sun.misc as optional was required.

Result:

Netty OSGi bundle will no longer interfere with a JCTools bundle.
