Allow non-standard HTTP/2 settings

Motivation:

The Http2Settings class currently disallows setting non-standard settings, which violates the spec.

Modifications:

Updated Http2Settings to permit arbitrary settings. Also adjusting the default initial capacity to allow setting all of the standard settings without reallocation.

Result:

Fixes #3560
