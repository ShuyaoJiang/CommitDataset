DuplexChannel to support shutdownInput

Motivation:
The DuplexChannel is currently incomplete and only supports shutting down the output side of a channel. This interface should also support shutting down the input side of the channel.

Modifications:
- Add shutdownInput and shutdown methods to the DuplexChannel interface
- Remove state in NIO and OIO for tracking input being shutdown independent of the underlying transport's socket type. Tracking the state independently may lead to inconsistent state.

Result:
DuplexChannel supports shutting down the input side of the channel
