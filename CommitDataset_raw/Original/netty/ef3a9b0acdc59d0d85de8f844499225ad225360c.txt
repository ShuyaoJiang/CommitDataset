Relax the sanity check in HttpClientUpgradeHandler

Motivation:

HttpClientUpgradeHandler currently throws an IllegalStateException when
the server sends a '101 Switching Protocols' response that has no
'Upgrade' header.

Some servers do not send the 'Upgrade' header on a successful protocol
upgrade and we could safely assume that the server accepted the
requested protocol upgrade in such a case, looking from the response
status code (101)

Modifications:

- Do not throw an IllegalStateException when the server responded 101
  without a 'Upgrade' header
- Note that we still check the equality of the 'Upgrade' header when it
  is present.

Result:

- Fixes #4523
- Better interoperability
