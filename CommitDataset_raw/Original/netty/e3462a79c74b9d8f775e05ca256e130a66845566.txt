MessageAggregator Potential Leak

Motivation:
MessageAggregator has a potential to leak if a new message is received before the existing message has completed, and if a HttpContent is received but maxContentLength has been exceeded, or the content length is too long.

Modifications:

- Make the HttpObjectAggregator more robust to leaks
- Reduce dependance on handlingOversizedMessage but instead rely on the more general check of a null currentMessage

Result:
More robust MessageAggregator with less chance of leaks
