[#2525] Use VoidChannelPromise in MessageToMessageEncoder when possible

Motivation:
At the moment MessageToMessageEncoder uses ctx.write(msg) when have more then one message was produced. This may produce more GC pressure then necessary as when the original ChannelPromise is a VoidChannelPromise we can safely also use one when write messages.

Modifications:
Use VoidChannelPromise when the original ChannelPromise was of this type

Result:
Less object creation and GC pressure
