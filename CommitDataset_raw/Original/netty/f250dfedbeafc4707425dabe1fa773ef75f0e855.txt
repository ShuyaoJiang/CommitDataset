HTTP/2 Sending a GO_AWAY with an error code should close conneciton

Motivation:
The specification requires that sending a GO_AWAY frame with an error code results in closing the TCP connection https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-http2-17#section-5.4.1.

Modifications:
- Close the connection after succesfully sending a GO_AWAY.

Result:
Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/3653
