Deprecate Unpooled.unmodifiableBuffer(ByteBuf...) (#8096)

Motivation:

Recent PR https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8040 introduced
Unpooled.wrappedUnmodifiableBuffer(ByteBuf...) which has the same
behaviour but wraps the provided array directly. This is preferred for
most uses (including varargs-based use) and if there are any unusual
cases of an explicit array which is re-used before the ByteBuf is
finished with, it can just be copied first.

Modifications:

Added @Deprecated annotation and javadoc to
Unpooled.unmodifiableBuffer(ByteBuf...).

Result:

Unpooled.unmodifiableBuffer(ByteBuf...) will be deprecated.
