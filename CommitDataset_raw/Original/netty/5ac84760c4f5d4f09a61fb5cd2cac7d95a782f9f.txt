Allow to create SslContext from existing PrivateKey / X509Certificate

Motivation:

Sometimes the user already has a PrivateKey / X509Certificate which should be used to create a new SslContext. At the moment we only allow to construct it via Files.

Modifications:

- Add new methods to the SslContextBuilder to allow creating a SslContext from PrivateKey / X509Certificate
- Mark all public constructors of *SslContext as @Deprecated, the user should use SslContextBuilder
- Update tests to us SslContextBuilder.

Result:

Creating of SslContext is possible with PrivateKay/X509Certificate
