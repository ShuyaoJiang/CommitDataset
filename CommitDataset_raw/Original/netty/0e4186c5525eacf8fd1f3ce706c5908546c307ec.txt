deprecate IntegerHolder for removal (#8339)

Motivation:

Seems like IntegerHolder counterHashCode field is the very old legacy field that is no longer used. Should be marked as deprecated and removed in the future versions.

Modification:

IntegerHolder class, InternalThreadLocalMap.counterHashCode() and InternalThreadLocalMap.setCounterHashCode(IntegerHolder counterHashCode) are now deprecated.
