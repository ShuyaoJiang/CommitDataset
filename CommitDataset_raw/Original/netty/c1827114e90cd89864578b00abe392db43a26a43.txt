Use ConnectException when connection failed for LocalChannel

Motivation:

To be more consistent we should use ConnectException when we fail the connect attempt because no LocalServerChannel exists with the given address.

Modifications:

Use correct exception.

Result:

More consistent handling of connection refused between different transports.
