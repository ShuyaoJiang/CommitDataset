Correctly handle the case when BUFFER_OVERFLOW happens during unwrap but the readable bytes are bigger then the expected applicationBufferSize

Motivation:

We need to ensure we handle the case when BUFFER_OVERFLOW happens during unwrap but the readable bytes are bigger then the expected applicationBufferSize. Otherwise we may produce an IllegalArgumentException as we will try to allocate a buffer with capacity < 0.

Modifications:

- Guard against this case.
- Ensure we not double release buffer on exception when doing unwrap.

Result:

No more exception when running testsuite with java 9.
