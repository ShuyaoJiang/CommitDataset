Update the comment of io.netty.buffer.PoolChunk.java (#7934)

Motivation:

When I read the source code, I found that the comment of PoolChunk is out of date, it may confuses readers with the description about memoryMap.

Modifications:

update the last passage of the comment of the PoolChunk class.

Result:
No change to any source code , just update comment.
