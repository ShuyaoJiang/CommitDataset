Change DefaultChannelId visibility to default. Related to [#5053]

Motivation:

There is no need to make DefaultChannelId package private as it may be useful for the user. For example EmbeddedChannel allows to inject a ChannelId when it is constructed. For this case the user can just use DefaultChannelId.

Modifications:

Change visibility of DefaultChannelId to public.

Result:

It's possible to create a new instance of DefaultChannelId by the user.
