Document and generalize `PromiseCombiner`

Motivation:

`PromiseCombiner` is really handy, but it's not obvious how to use it from its existing documentation/method signatures.

Modification:

- Added javadoc comments to explain the theory of operation of `PromiseCombiner`.
- Generalized `PromiseCombiner` to work with `Futures` so it's clearer that the things for which it's listening won't be modified.

Result:

`PromiseCombiner` is easier to understand.
