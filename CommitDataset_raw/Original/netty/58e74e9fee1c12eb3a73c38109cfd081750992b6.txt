Support running Netty in bootstrap class loader

Motivation:

Fix NullPointerExceptions that occur when running netty-tcnative inside the bootstrap class loader.

Modifications:

- Replace loader.getResource(...) with ClassLoader.getSystemResource(...) when loader is null.
- Replace loader.loadClass(...) with Class.forName(..., false, loader) which works when loader is both null and non-null.

Result:

Support running native libs in bootstrap class loader
