Expose channel pool configuration to subclasses.

Motivation:

`SimpleChannelPool` subclasses are likely to override the `connectChannel` method, and are likely to clobber the cloned `Bootstrap` handler in the process. To allow subclasses to properly notify the pool listener of new connections, we should expose (at least) the `handler` property of the pool to subclasses.

Modifications:

Expose `SimpleChannelPool` properties to subclasses via `protected` getters.

Result:

Subclasses can now use the bootstrap, handler, health checker, and health-check-on-release preoperties from their superclass.
