DefaultHttp2ConnectionEncoder private constructors on inner classes

Motivation:
DefaultHttp2ConnectionEncoder.FlowControlledHeaders and DefaultHttp2ConnectionEncoder.FlowControlledData have private constructors which may result in static factory methods being generated to construct instances of these classes.

Modifications:
- Make constructors public for these private classes

Result:
Accessor for inner class constructor more correct and no possibiliy of synthetic method generation.
