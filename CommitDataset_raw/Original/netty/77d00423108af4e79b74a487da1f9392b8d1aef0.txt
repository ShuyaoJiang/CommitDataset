Allow override of HTTP/2 graceful connection shutdown.

Motivation:

Currently the graceful shutdown of the HTTP/2 connection waits until there are no active streams. There may be use cases that buffer stream creation (due to limits imposed by MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS), in which case they may still want those streams to complete before closing.

Modifications:

Added a isGracefulShutdownComplete method to Http2ConnectionHandler, which can be overridden by a subclass.

Result:

Graceful shutdown logic can be overridden.
