HTTP/2 Prevent modification of activeStreams while iterating

Motivation:
The Http2Connection interface exposes an activeStreams() method which allows direct iteration over the underlying collection. There are a few places that make copies of this collection to avoid modification while iterating, and a few places that do not make copies. The copy operation can be expensive on hot code paths and also we are not consistently iterating over the activeStreams collection.

Modifications:
- The Http2Connection interface should reduce the exposure of the underlying collection and just expose what is necessary for the interface to function.  This is just a means to iterate over the collection.
- The DefaultHttp2Connection should use this new interface and protect it's internal state while iteration is occurring.

Result:
Reduction in surface area of the Http2Connection interface.  Consistent iteration of the set of active streams.  Concurrent modification exceptions are handled in 1 encapsulated spot.
