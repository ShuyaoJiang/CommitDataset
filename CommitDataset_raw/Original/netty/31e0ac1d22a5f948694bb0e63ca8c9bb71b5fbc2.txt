Expose the SelectorProvider used by the NioEventLoop

Motivation:

If a user writes an own nio based transport which uses a special SelectorProvider it is useful to be able to get the SelectorProvider that is used by a NioEventLoop. This way this can be used when implement AbstractChannel.isCompatible(...) and check that the SelectorProvider is the correct one.

Modifications:

Expose the SelectorProvider.

Result:

Be able to get the SelectorProvider used by a NioEventLoop.
