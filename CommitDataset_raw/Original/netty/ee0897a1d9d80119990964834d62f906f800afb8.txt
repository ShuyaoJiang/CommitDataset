HttpContentDecompressor should change decompressed requests to chunked encoding. Fixes issue #5428

`HttpContentDecoder` was removing `Content-Length` header but not adding a `Transfer-Encoding` header which goes against the HTTP spec.

Added `Transfer-Encoding` header with value `chunked` when `Content-Length` is removed.
Modified existing unit test to also check for this condition.

Compliance with HTTP spec.
