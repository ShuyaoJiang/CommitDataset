Fixes #7566 by handling concatenated GZIP streams.

Motivation:
According to RFC 1952, concatenation of valid gzip streams is also a valid gzip stream. JdkZlibDecoder only processed the first and discarded the rest.

Modifications:
- Introduced a constructor argument decompressConcatenated that if true, JdkZlibDecoder would continue to process the stream.

Result:
- If 'decompressConcatenated = true', concatenated streams would be processed in
compliance to RFC 1952.
- If 'decompressConcatenated = false' (default), existing behavior would remain.
