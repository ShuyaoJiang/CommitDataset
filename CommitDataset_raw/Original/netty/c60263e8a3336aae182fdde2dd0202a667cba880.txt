Correctly handle responses with status 205 and payload. (#7891)

Motivation:

HTTP responses with status of 205 should not contain a payload. We should enforce this.

Modifications:

Correctly handle responses with status 205 and payload by set Content-Length: 0 header and stripping out the content.

Result:

Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/7888
