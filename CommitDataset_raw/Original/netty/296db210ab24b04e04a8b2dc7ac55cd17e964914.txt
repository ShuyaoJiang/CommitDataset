Generate the default JAR to make oss.sonatype.org happy

Motivation:

oss.sonatype.org refuses to promote an artifact if it doesn't have the
default JAR (the JAR without classifier.)

Modifications:

- Generate both the default JAR and the native JAR to make
  oss.sonatype.org happy
- Rename the profile 'release' to 'restricted-release' which reflects
  what it really does better
- Remove the redundant <quickbuild>true</quickbuild> in all/pom.xml
  We specify the profile 'full' that triggers that property already
  in maven-release-plugin configuration.

Result:

oss.sonatype.org is happy.  Simpler pom.xml
