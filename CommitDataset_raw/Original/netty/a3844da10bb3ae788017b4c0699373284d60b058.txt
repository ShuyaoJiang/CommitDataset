NoClassDefFoundError on Android platform when try to use DefaultDnsServerAddressStreamProvider. (#8656)

Motivation:

Andoid does not contain javax.naming.* so we should not try to use it to prevent a NoClassDefFoundError on init.

Modifications:

Only try to use javax.naming.* to retrieve nameservers when not using Android.

Result:

Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/8654.
