Optimizations in QueryStringEncoder

Motivation:

A life cycle of QueryStringEncoder is simple: create, append params, convert to String. Current realization collect params in the list, and calculate an URI string in `toString` method. We can simplify this: don't store params to the list, and immediately append parameters to the `StringBuilder`.

Modifications:

- Remove list for params and remove a tuple class `Param`.
- Use one common `StringBuilder` and append parameters into it.
- Resolve `TODO` in the `encodeParam` method.

Result:

Less allocations (no `ArrayList`, no `Param` tuples). Second `toString` call is faster.
