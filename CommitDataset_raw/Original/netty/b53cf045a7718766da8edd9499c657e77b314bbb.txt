SelectedSelectionKeySet should only be created if the set can be instrumented

Motivation:

If we can not replace the internal used Set of the Selector there is no need to create an SelectedSelectionKeySet instance.

Modification:

Only create SelectedSelectionKeySet if we will replace the internal set.

Result:

Less object creation in some cases and cleaner code.
