Reduce SO_TIMEOUT of testsuite so it finishes sooner

Motivation:

Testing the OIO transport takes longer time than other transports because it has to wait for SO_TIMEOUT if there is nothing to read.  In production, it's not a good idea to decrease this value (1000ms) because it will result in so many SocketTimeoutExceptions internally, but doing so in the testsuite should be fine.

Modifications:

Reduce the default SO_TIMEOUT of OIO channels to 10 ms.

Result:

Our testsuite finishes sooner.
