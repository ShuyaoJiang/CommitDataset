Correctly implement SelectedSelectionKeySet.remove(...) / contains(...) again so it works with the NIO Selector.

Motivation:

c1a335446daf5892eab2e134538ba0388162f18b reimplemented remove(...) and contains(...) in a way which made it not work anymore when used by the Selector.

Modifications:

Partly revert changes in c1a335446daf5892eab2e134538ba0388162f18b.

Result:

Works again as expected
