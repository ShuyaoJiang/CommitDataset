Close connection for CorruptedFrameException (#8705)

Motivation:

The CorruptedFrameException from the finish() method of the Utf8Validator gets propagated to other handlers while the connection is still open.

Modification:

Override exceptionCaught method of the Utf8FrameValidator and close the connection if it is a CorruptedFrameException.

Result:

The CorruptedFrameException gets propagated to other handlers only after properly closing the connection.
