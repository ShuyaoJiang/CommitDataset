DefaultHttp2HeadersTest updates

Motivation:
Recently a bug was found in DefaultHttp2Headers where the state of the headers could be corrupted due to the extra tracking to make pseudo headers first during iteration. Unit tests did not catch this bug.

Modifications:
- Update unit tests to cover more methods

Result:
Unit tests for DefaultHttp2Headers have better code coverage.
