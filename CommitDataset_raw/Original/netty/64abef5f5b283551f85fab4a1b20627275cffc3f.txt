Add exposeHeaders and allowedRequestHeaders that accept CharSequence, close #6328

Motivation:

Netty 4.1 introduced AsciiString and defines HttpHeaderNames constants
as such.

It would be convenient to be able to pass them to `exposeHeaders` and
`allowedRequestHeaders` directly without having to call `toString`.

Modifications:

Add `exposeHeaders` and `allowedRequestHeaders` overloads that take a
`CharSequence`.

Result:

More convenient API
