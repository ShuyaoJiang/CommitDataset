IovArray.add(...) should check if buffer has memory address.

Motivation:

We currently not check if the buffer has a memory address and just assume this is the case if the nioBufferCount() == 1.

Modifications:

- Check hasMemoryAddress() before trying to access it.
- Add unit case.

Result:

More correct and robust code. Related to [#7752].
