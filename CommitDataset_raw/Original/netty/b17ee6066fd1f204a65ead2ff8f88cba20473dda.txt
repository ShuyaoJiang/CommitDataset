HTTP/2 Log Cleanup

Motivation:
The format of some log lines used the printf style formatting instead of the logger {} formatting for variables. This would lead to printing out the literal printf tokens instead of substituting the value.

Modifications:
- Fix the format string for log statements which use printf style formatting

Result:
Logs actually capture the value of the variables instead of fixed string tokens.
