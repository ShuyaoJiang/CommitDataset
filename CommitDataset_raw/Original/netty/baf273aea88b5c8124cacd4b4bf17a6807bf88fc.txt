Trigger user event when H2 conn preface & SETTINGS frame are sent

Motivation:
Previously client Http2ConnectionHandler trigger a user event
immediately when the HTTP/2 connection preface is sent. Any attempt to
immediately send a new request could cause the server to terminate the
connection, as it might not have received the SETTINGS frame from the
client. Per RFC7540 Section 3.5, the preface "MUST be followed by a
SETTINGS frame (Section 6.5), which MAY be empty."
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-3.5)

This event could be made more meaningful if it also indicates that the
initial client SETTINGS frame has been sent to signal that the channel
is ready to send new requests.

Modification:
- Renamed event to Http2ConnectionPrefaceAndSettingsFrameWrittenEvent.
- Modified Http2ConnectionHandler to trigger the user event only if it
  is a client and it has sent both the preface and SETTINGS frame.

Result:
It is now safe to use the event as an indicator that the HTTP/2
connection is ready to send new requests.
