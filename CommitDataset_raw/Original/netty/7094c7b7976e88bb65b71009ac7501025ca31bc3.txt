Dereference when calling PooledByteBuf.deallocate()

Motivation:

We missed to dereference the chunk and tmpNioBuf when calling deallocate(). This means the GC can not collect these as we still hold a reference while have the PooledByteBuf in the recycler stack.

Modifications:

Dereference chunk and tmpNioBuf.

Result:

GC can collect things.
