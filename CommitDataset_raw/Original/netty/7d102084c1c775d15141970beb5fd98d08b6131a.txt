Remove Rfc6265 prefix from cookie encoders and decoders

Motivation:

Rfc6265Client/ServerCookieEncoder is a better replacement of the old
Client/ServerCookieEncoder, and thus there's no point of keeping both.

Modifications:

- Remove the old Client/ServerCookieEncoder
- Remove the 'Rfc6265' prefix from the new cookie encoder/decoder
  classes
- Deprecate CookieDecoder

Result:

We have much better cookie encoder/decoder implementation now.
