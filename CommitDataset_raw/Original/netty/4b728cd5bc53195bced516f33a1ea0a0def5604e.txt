Ignore some test-flakiness when using Java11+ due outstanding Java11 bug. (#7984)

Motivation:

Java11 disallow draining any remaining bytes from the socket if a write causes a connection reset. This should be completely safe to do. At the moment if a write is causing a connection-reset you basically loose all the pending bytes that are sitting on the socket and are waiting to be read.

This happens because SocketOutputStream.write(…) may call AbstractPlainSocketImpl.setConnectionReset(…). Once this method is called any read(…) call will just throw a SocketException without even attempt to read any remaining data.

Modifications:

Tolarate if remaining bytes could not be read when using OIO.

Result:

Be able to build Netty and run testsuite while using Java11
