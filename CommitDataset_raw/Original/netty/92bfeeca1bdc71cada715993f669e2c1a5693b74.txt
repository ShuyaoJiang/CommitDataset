No need to release lock and acquire again when allocate normal size.

Motiviation:

When tried to allocate tiny and small sized and failed to serve these out of the PoolSubPage we exit the synchronization
block just to enter it again when call allocateNormal(...).

Modification:

Not exit the synchronized block until allocateNormal(...) is done.

Result:

Better performance.
