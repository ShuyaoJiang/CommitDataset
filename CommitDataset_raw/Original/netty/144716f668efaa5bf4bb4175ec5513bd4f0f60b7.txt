HTTP/2 support pending data larger than Integer.MAX_VALUE

Motivation:
Currently the remote flow controller limits the maximum amount of pending data to Integer.MAX_VALUE. The overflow handling is also not very graceful in that it may lead to infinite loops, or otherwise no progress being made.

Modifications:
- StreamByteDistributor and RemoteFlowController should support pending bytes of type long.

Result:
Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/4283
