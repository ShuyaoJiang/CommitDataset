Misc clean up

Motivation:
IntelliJ issues several warnings.

Modifications:

* `ClientCookieDecoder` and `ServerCookieDecoder`:
  * `nameEnd`, `valueBegin` and `valueEnd` don't need to be initialized
  * `keyValLoop` loop doesn't been to be labelled, as it's the most inner one (same thing for labelled breaks)
  * Remove `if (i != headerLen)` as condition is always true
* `ClientCookieEncoder` javadoc still mention old logic
* `DefaultCookie`, `ServerCookieEncoder` and `DefaultHttpHeaders` use ternary ops that can be turned into simple boolean ones
* `DefaultHeaders` uses a for(int) loop over an array. It can be turned into a foreach one as javac doesn't allocate an iterator to iterate over arrays
* `DefaultHttp2Headers` and `AbstractByteBuf` `equal` can be turned into a single boolean statement
Result:

Cleaner code
