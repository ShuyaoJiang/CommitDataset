Add version check for JDK9 and beyond.

Motivation:

Netty's platform dependent parts should know about JDK9.

Modifications:

JDK9 introduce Runtime$Version Runtime.version() which has an int major()
method that always return the major Java version. I call that method to
get the Java major version.

Result:

Netty will recognize all future JDK versions.
