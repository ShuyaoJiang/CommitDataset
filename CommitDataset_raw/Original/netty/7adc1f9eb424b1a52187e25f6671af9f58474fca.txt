STOMP Headers Name Comparator

Motivation:
The HashingStrategy for DefaultStompHeaders was using the java .equals() method which would fail to compare String, AsciiString, and other CharSequence objects as equal.

Modification:
- Use AsciiString.CASE_SENSITIVE_HASHER for DefaultStompHeaders

Result:
DefaultStompHeaders work with all CharSequence objects.
