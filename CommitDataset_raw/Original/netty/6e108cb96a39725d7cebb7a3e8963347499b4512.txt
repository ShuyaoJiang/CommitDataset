Improve the performance of copying header sets when hashing and name validation are equivalent.

Motivation:
Headers and groups of headers are frequently copied and the current mechanism is slower than it needs to be.

Modifications:
Skip name validation and hash computation when they are not necessary.
Fix emergent bug in CombinedHttpHeaders identified with better testing
Fix memory leak in DefaultHttp2Headers when clearing
Added benchmarks

Result:
Faster header copying and some collateral bug fixes
