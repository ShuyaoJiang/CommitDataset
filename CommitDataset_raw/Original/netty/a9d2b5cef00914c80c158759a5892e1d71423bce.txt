Skip empty buffers and not pass these to BIO_write

Motivation:

When BIO_write is called with an empty buffer it will return 0 for which we call ERR_clear_error(). This is not neccessary as we should just skip these buffers. This eliminates a lot of overhead.

Modifications:

Skip empty src buffers when call unwrap(...).

Result:

Less overhead for unwrap(...) when called with empty buffers.
