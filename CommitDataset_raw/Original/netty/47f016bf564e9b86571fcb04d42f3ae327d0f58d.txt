extract self() method to avoid too many unchecked @SuppressWarnings

Motivation:

There are many @SuppressWarnings("unchecked") in the code for the same purpose that we want to do this return:

@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
public B someMethod() {
    ......
    return (B) this;
}
Modification:

Add a method self() and reuse in all these return lines:

@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    private B self() {
        return (B) this;
    }
Result:

Then only one @SuppressWarnings("unchecked") left in the code.
