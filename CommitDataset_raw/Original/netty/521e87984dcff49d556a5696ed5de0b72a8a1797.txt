SslHandler.setHandshakeTimeout*(...) should also been enforced on the server side.

Motivation:

We should also enforce the handshake timeout on the server-side to allow closing connections which will not finish the handshake in an expected amount of time.

Modifications:

- Enforce the timeout on the server and client side
- Add unit test.

Result:

Fixes [#7230].
