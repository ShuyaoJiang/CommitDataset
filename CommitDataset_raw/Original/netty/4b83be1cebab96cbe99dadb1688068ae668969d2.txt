We should fail fast if the given PrivateKey or X509Certificate chain is not supported by the used SslProvider. (#9009)

Motivation:

Some SslProvider do support different types of keys and chains. We should fail fast if we can not support the type.

Related to https://github.com/netty/netty-tcnative/issues/455.

Modifications:

- Try to parse key / chain first and if if this fails throw and SslException
- Add tests.

Result:

Fail fast.
