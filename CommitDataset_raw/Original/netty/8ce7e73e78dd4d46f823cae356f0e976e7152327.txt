Prevent extra peformance hit by fillInStackTrace() when create a new annotated connect exception.

Motivation:

To make it easier to debug connect exceptions we create new exceptions which also contain the remote address. For this we basically created a new instance and call setStackTrace(...). When doing this we pay an extra penality because it calls fillInStackTrace() when calling the super constructor.

Modifications:

Create special sub-classes of Exceptions that override the fillInStackTrace() method and so eliminate the overhead.

Result:

Less overhead when "annotate" connect exceptions.
