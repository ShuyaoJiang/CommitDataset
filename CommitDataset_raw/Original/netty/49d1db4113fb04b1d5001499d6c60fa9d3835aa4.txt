Http2MultiplexCodec.DefaultHttpStreamChannel.isOpen() / isActive() shoule be false when fireChannelActive() is called

Motivation:

When part of a HTTP/2 StreamChannel the Http2StreamChannel.isOpen() / isActive() should report false within a call to a ChannelInboundHandlers channelInactive() method.

Modifications:

Fullfill promise before call fireChannelInactive()

Result:

Correctly update state / promise before notify handlers. Fixes [#7638]
