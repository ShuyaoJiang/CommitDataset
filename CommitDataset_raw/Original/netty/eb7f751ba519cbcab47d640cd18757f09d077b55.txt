Log less confusing message when try to load native library

Motivation:

At the moment we log very confusing messages when trying to load a native library which kind of suggest that the whole loading process failed even if just one mechanism failed and the library could be loaded at the end.

Modifications:

Make the mesage less confusing and also log a successful load of the native library.

Result:

Less confusing logs.
