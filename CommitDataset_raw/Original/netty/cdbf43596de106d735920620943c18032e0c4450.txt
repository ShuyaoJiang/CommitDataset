Add generic utility for enqueuing buffers with promises and dequeueing them in arbitrary byte ranges.

Motivation:
Simplifies writing code that needs to merge or slice a sequence of buffer & promise pairs into chunks of arbitrary sizes.
For example in HTTP2 we merge or split buffers across fixed-size DATA frame boundaries.

Modifications:
Add new utility class CoalescingBufferQueue

Result:
Following this change HTTP2 code will switch to use it instead of CompositeByteBuffer for DATA frame coalescing.
