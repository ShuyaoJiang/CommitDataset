Cleanup : validatePromise ranamed to isNotValidPromise and added more tests for corner cases.

Motivation:

Result of validatePromise() is always inverted with if (!validatePromise()).

Modification:

validatePromise() renamed to isNotValidPromise() and now returns inverted state so you don't need to invert state in conditions. Also name is now more meaningful according to returned result.
Added more tests for validatePromise corner cases with Exceptions.

Result:

Code easier to read. No need in inverted result.
