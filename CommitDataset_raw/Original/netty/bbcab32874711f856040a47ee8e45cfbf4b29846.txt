Ensure netty builds with java9 (build 9+181)

Motivation:

To be able to build with latest java9 release we need to adjust commons-lang version and maven-enforcer-plugin.

Modifications:

- Use commons-lang 2.6.0
- Use maven-enforcer-plugin 3.0.0.M1 when building with java9

Result:

Netty builds again with latest java9 release
