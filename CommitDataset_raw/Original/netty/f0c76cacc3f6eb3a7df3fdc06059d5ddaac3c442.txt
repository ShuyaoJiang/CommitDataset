Replace reflective access of Throwable#addSuppressed with version guarded access

Motivation:

In environments with a security manager, the reflective access to get the reference to
Throwable#addSuppressed can cause issues that result in Netty failing to load. The main
motivation in this pull request is to remove the use of reflection to prevent issues in
these environments.

Modifications:

ThrowableUtil no longer uses Class#getDeclaredMembers to get the Method that references
Throwable#addSuppressed and instead guards the call to Throwable#addSuppressed with a
Java version check.

Additionally, a annotation was added that suppresses the animal sniffer java16 signature
check on the given method. The benefit of the annotation is that it limits the exclusion
of Throwable to just the ThrowableUtil class and has string text indicating the reason
for suppressing the java16 signature check.

Result:

Netty no longer requires the use of Class#getDeclaredMethod for ThrowableUtil and will
work in environments restricted by a security manager without needing to grant reflection
permissions.

Fixes #7614
