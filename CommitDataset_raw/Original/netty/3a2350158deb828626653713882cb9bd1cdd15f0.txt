Fix for NETTY-183 Client-side HTTP tunneling transport logs and swallows an exceptionCaught event.
* HttpTunnelingClientSocketChannel.ServletChannelHandler does not log the caught exception anymore. The exception is propagated to the HttpTunnelingClientSocketChannel's pipeline.
* More comprehensive log message on the server side
