Explicit specify hostaddress during tests to ensure testsuite pass on docker (mac)

Motivation:

When run the current testsuite on docker (mac) it will fail a few tests with:

io.netty.channel.AbstractChannel$AnnotatedConnectException: connect(..) failed: Cannot assign requested address: /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0%0:46607
Caused by: java.net.ConnectException: connect(..) failed: Cannot assign requested address

Modifications:

Specify host explicit as done in other tests to only use ipv6 when really supported.

Result:

Build pass on docker as well
