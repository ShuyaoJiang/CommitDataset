Fix GOAWAY logic in Http2Encoder and Http2Decoder.

Motivation:

1) The current implementation doesn't allow for HEADERS, DATA, PING, PRIORITY and SETTINGS
   frames to be sent after GOAWAY.

2) When receiving or sending a GOAWAY frame, all streams with ids greater than the lastStreamId
   of the GOAWAY frame should be closed. That's not happening.

Modifications:

1) Allow sending of HEADERS and DATA frames after GOAWAY for streams with ids < lastStreamId.
2) Always allow sending PING, PRIORITY AND SETTINGS frames.
3) Allow sending multiple GOAWAY frames with decreasing lastStreamIds.
4) After receiving or sending a GOAWAY frame, close all streams with ids > lastStreamId.

Result:

The GOAWAY handling is more correct.
