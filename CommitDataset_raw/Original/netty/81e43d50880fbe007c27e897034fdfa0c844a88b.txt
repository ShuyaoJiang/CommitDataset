DefaultFileRegion.transferTo with invalid count may cause busy-spin (#8885)

Motivation:

`DefaultFileRegion.transferTo` will return 0 all the time when we request more data then the actual file size. This may result in a busy spin while processing the fileregion during writes.

Modifications:

- If we wrote 0 bytes check if the underlying file size is smaller then the requested count and if so throw an IOException
- Add DefaultFileRegionTest
- Add a test to the testsuite

Result:

Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/8868.
