Add methods to easily release messages from inbound / outbound buffer of EmbeddedChannel

Motivation:

Often the user uses EmbeddedChannel within unit tests where the only "important" thing is to know if any pending messages were in the buffer and then release these.
We should provide methods for this so the user not need to manually loop through these and release.

Modifications:

Add methods to easily handle releasing of messages.

Result:

Less boiler-plate code for the user to write.
