ByteToMessageDecoder ChannelInputShutdownEvent support

Motivation:
b714297a44ced34643fa60ca854f1880d02ba649 introduced ChannelInputShutdownEvent support for HttpObjectDecoder. However this should have been added to the super class ByteToMessageDecoder, and ByteToMessageDecoder should not propegate a channelInactive event through the pipeline in this case.

Modifications:
- Move the ChannelInputShutdownEvent handling from HttpObjectDecoder to ByteToMessageDecoder
- ByteToMessageDecoder doesn't call ctx.fireChannelInactive() on ChannelInputShutdownEvent

Result:
Half closed events are treated more generically, and don't get translated into a channelInactive pipeline event.
