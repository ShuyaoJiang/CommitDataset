Add socksx package which supports SOCKS 4/4a/5

Motivation:

SOCKS 4 and 5 are very different protocols although they share the same
name.  It is not possible to incorporate the two protocol versions into
a single package.

Modifications:

- Add a new package called 'socksx' to supercede 'socks' package.
- Add SOCKS 4/4a support to the 'socksx' package

Result:

codec-socks now supports all SOCKS versions
