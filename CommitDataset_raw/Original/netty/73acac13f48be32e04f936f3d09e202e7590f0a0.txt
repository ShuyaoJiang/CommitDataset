Check if hostname validation is supported before trying to use in test. (#8333)

Motivation:

a208f6dc7c775ce8d7934f252cd6fa7527643f76 added a testcase which uses hostname validation which may not be supported by OpenSSL depending on the version that is used. We should check first before we try to use it.

Modifications:

Add assumeTrue(...) check to ensure hostname validation is supported before trying to run the test.

Result:

No more test-failures on OpenSSL versions < 1.0.2.
