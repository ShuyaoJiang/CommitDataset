DefaultChannelConfig maxMessagesPerRead default not always set

Motivation:
ChannelMetadata has a field minMaxMessagesPerRead which can be confusing. There are also some cases where static instances are used and the default value for channel type is not being applied.

Modifications:
- use a default value which is set unconditionally to simplify
- make sure static instances of MaxMessagesRecvByteBufAllocator are not used if the intention is that the default maxMessagesPerRead should be derived from the channel type.

Result:
Less confusing interfaces in ChannelMetadata and ChannelConfig. Default maxMessagesPerRead is correctly applied.
