Fix incorrect bytesBefore/indexOf() in ReplayingDecoderBuffer

Motivation:

bytesBefore(length, ...), bytesBefore(index, length, ...), and
indexOf(fromIndex, toIndex,...) in ReplayingDecoderBuffer are buggy.
They trigger 'REPLAY even when they don't need to.

Modification:

Implement the buggy methods properly so that REPLAYs are not triggered
unnecessarily.

Result:

Correct behvaior
