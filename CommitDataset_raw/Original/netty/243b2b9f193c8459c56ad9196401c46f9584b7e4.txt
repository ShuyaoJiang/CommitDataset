PooledByteBufAllocatorTest may has memory visiblity issues as it uses non concurrent queue

Motivation:

PooledByteBufAllocatorTest uses an ArrayQueue but access it from multiple threads (not concurrently but still from different threads). This may leak to memory visibility issues.

Modifications:

- Use a concurrent queue
- Some cleanup

Result:

Non racy test code.
