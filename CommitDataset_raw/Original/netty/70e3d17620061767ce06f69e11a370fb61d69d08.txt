fixing small leak on exception on the transport-epoll-native allocation

Motivation:

the JNI function ThrowNew won't release any allocated memory.
The method exceptionMessage is allocating a new string concatenating 2 constant strings
What is creating a small leak in case of these exceptions are happening.

Modifications:

Added new methods that will use exceptionMessage and free resources accordingly.
I am also removing the inline definition on these methods as they could be reused by
other added modules (e.g. libaio which should be coming soon)

Result:

No more leaks in case of failures.
