ByteBufs which are not resizable should not throw in ensureWritable(int,boolean)

Motivation:
ByteBuf#ensureWritable(int,boolean) returns an int indicating the status of the resize operation. For buffers that are unmodifiable or cannot be resized this method shouldn't throw but just return 1.
ByteBuf#ensureWriteable(int) should throw unmodifiable buffers.

Modifications:
- ReadOnlyByteBuf should be updated as described above.
- Add a unit test to SslHandler which verifies the read only buffer can be tolerated in the aggregation algorithm.

Result:
Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/7002.
