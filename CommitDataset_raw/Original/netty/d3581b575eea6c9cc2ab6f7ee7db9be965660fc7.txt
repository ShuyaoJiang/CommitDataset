UnixResolverDnsServerAddressStreamProvider should allow for empty /etc/resolver dir

Motivation:
UnixResolverDnsServerAddressStreamProvider currently throws an exception if /etc/resolver exists but it empty. This shouldn't be an exception and can be tolerated as if there is no contribution from /etc/resolver.

Modifications:
- Treat /etc/resolver as present and empty the same as not being present

Result:
UnixResolverDnsServerAddressStreamProvider initialization can tolerate empty /etc/resolver directory.
