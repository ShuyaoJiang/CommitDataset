Throw exception if KeyManagerFactory is used with OpenSslServerContext

Motivation:

We currently not supported using KeyManagerFactory with OpenSslServerContext and so should throw an exception if the user tries to do so. This will at least not give suprising and hard to debug problems later.

Modifications:

Throw exception if a user tries to construct a OpenSslServerContext with a KeyManagerFactory

Result:

Fail fast if the user tries to use something that is not supported.
