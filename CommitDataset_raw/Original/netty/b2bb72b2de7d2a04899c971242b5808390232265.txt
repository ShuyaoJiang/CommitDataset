[#5171] Ensure NioDatagramChannelConfig can be instanced on android

Motivation:

NioDatagramChannelConfig currently uses NetworkChannel in its static { } block and so fails to init on android which not has this class.

Modifications:

Use reflection to load the NetworkChannel.class

Result:

Be able to use NIO Datagram on android as well.
