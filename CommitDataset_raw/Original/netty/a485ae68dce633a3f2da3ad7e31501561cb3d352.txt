Guard against race when calling SslHandler.handshakeFuture().sync()

Motivation:

If the handlerAdded(...) callback was not called, the checkDeadLock() of the handshakeFuture will produce an IllegalStateException.
This was first reported at https://github.com/impossibl/pgjdbc-ng/issues/168 .

Modifications:

Pass deadlock check if ctx is null

Result:

No more race and so IllegalStateException.
