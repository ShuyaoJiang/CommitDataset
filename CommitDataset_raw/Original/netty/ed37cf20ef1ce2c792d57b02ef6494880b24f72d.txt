Introduce HashedWheelTimer.pendingTimeouts()

Motivation:

Fixes #6681.

Modification:

For the sake of better timer observability, expose the number of pending timeouts through the new HashedWheelTimer.pendingTimeouts method .

Result:

It's now ridiculously easy to observe Netty timer's very basic and yet important metric, the number of pending tasks/timeouts.
