Remove uninterpolated `{}` in DefaultHttp2ConnectionDecoder log message (#8441)

Motivation:

There are log messages emitted from Http2ConnectionDecoder of the form
```
INF i.n.h.c.h.DefaultHttp2ConnectionDecoder ignoring HEADERS frame for stream RST_STREAM sent. {}
```

Modifications:

Remove the trailing `{}` in the log message that doesn't have a value.

Result:

Log messages no longer have a trailing `{}`.
