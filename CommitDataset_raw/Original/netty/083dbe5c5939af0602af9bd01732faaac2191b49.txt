Correctly count acquired channels when timeout occurs in FixedChannelPool

Motivation:

We don't decrease acquired channel count in FixedChannelPool when timeout occurs by AcquireTimeoutAction.NEW and eventually fails.

Modifications:

Set AcquireTask.acquired=true to call decrementAndRunTaskQueue when timeout action fails.

Result:

Acquired channel count decreases correctly.
