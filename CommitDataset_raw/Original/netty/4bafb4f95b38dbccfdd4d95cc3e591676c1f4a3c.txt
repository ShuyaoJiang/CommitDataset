[#3368] Ensure ByteBuf is not release two times

Motivation:

As the ByteBuf is not set to null after release it we may try to release it again in handleReadException()

Modifications:

-  set ByteBuf to null to avoid another byteBuf.release() to be called in handleReadException()

Result:

No IllegalReferenceCountException anymore
