ServerBootstrap.handler(...) will add handler before Channel is registered.

Motivation:

If you set a ChannelHandler via ServerBootstrap.handler(...) it is added to the ChannelPipeline before the Channel is registered. This will lead to and IllegalStateException if a user tries to access the EventLoop in the ChannelHandler.handlerAdded(...) method.

Modifications:

Delay the adding of the ChannelHandler until the Channel was registered.

Result:

No more IllegalStateException.
