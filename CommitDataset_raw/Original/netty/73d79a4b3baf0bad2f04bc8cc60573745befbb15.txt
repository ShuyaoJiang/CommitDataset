Do not use hard-coded handler names in HTTP/2

Motivation:

Our HTTP/2 implementation sometimes uses hard-coded handler names when
adding/removing a handler to/from a pipeline. It's not really a good
idea because it can easily result in name clashes. Unless there is a
good reason, we need to use the reference to the handlers

Modifications:

- Allow null as a handler name for Http2Client/ServerUpgradeCodec
  - Use null as the default upgrade handler name
- Do not use handler name strings in some test cases and examples

Result:

Fixes #3815
