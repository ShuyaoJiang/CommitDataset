Made it easier to use custom ChannelId instances with Channel implementations that rely on the AbstractChannel(Channel parent) constructor.

Motivation:

The AbstractChannel(Channel parent) constructor was previously hard-coded to always
call DefaultChannelId.newInstance(), and this made it difficult to use a custom
ChannelId implementation with some commonly used Channel implementations.

Modifications:

Introduced newId() method in AbstractChannel, which by default returns
DefaultChannelId.newInstance() but can be overridden by subclasses. Added
ensureDefaultChannelId() test to AbstractChannelTest, to ensure the prior
behavior of calling DefaultChannelId.newInstance() still holds with the
AbstractChannel(Channel parent) constructor.

Result:

AbstractChannel now has the protected newId() method, but there is no functional
difference.
