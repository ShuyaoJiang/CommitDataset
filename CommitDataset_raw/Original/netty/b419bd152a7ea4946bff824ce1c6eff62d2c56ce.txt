Handle the possibility of HTTP/0.9 with a better error message

Motivation

RFC 1945 (see section 3.1) says that request lines may not have a version in which case the request is assumed to be HTTP/0.9. We don't necessarily want to support that but the existing Exception should indicate the possibility of the request being HTTP/0.9 and give the user a chance to track it down.

Modifications

Indicate in the Exception's message that the request is possibly HTTP/0.9.

Result

Fixes #6739
