Ensure setting / getting the traffic class on an ipv4 only system works when using the native transport.

Motivation:

We tried to set IPV6 opts on an ipv4 only system and so failed to set / get the traffic opts. This resulted in a test-error when trying to compile netty on ipv4 only systems.

Modifications:

Use the correct opts depending on if the system is ipv4 only or not.

Result:

Be able to build and use on ipv4 only systems.
