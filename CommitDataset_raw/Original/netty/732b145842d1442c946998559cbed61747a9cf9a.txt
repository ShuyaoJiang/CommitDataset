Http2ConnectionHandler: allow graceful shutdown to wait forever

Motivation:

There should be a way to allow graceful shutdown to wait for all open streams to close without a timeout. Using gracefulShutdownTimeoutMillis with a large value is a bit of a hack, and has a gotcha that sufficiently large values will overflow the long, resulting in a ClosingChannelFutureListener that executes immediately.

Modification:

Allow to use gracefulShutdownTimeoutMillis(-1) to express waiting until all streams are closed.

Result:

We can now shutdown the connection without a forced timeout.
