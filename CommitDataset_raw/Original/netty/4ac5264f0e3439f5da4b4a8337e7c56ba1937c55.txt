Remove unnecessary loop variable from `AsciiString`. (#8711)

Motivation:

Incrementing two variables in sync is not necessary when only one will do.

Modifications:

- Remove `j` from `for` loop and replace with `i`.
- Add more unit testing scenarios to cover changed code.

Results:

Unnecessary variable removed.
