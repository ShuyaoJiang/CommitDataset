[#2705] Call fireChannelReadComplete() if channelActive(...) decodes messages in ReplayingDecoder / ByteToMessageDecoder

Motivation:

In ReplayingDecoder / ByteToMessageDecoder channelInactive(...) method we try to decode a last time and fire all decoded messages throw the pipeline before call ctx.fireChannelInactive(...). To keep the correct order of events we also need to call ctx.fireChannelReadComplete() if we read anything.

Modifications:

- Channel channelInactive(...) to call ctx.fireChannelReadComplete() if something was decoded
- Move out.recycle() to finally block

Result:

Correct order of events.
