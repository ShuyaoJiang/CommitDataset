Unify {Epoll,KQueue}EventLoopGroup initialization.

Motivation:
`Epoll.ensureAvailability()` is called multiple times, once in
static initialization and in a couple of the constructors.  This is
redundant and confusing to read.

Modifications:
Move `Epoll.ensureAvailability()` call into an instance initializer
and remove all other references.  This ensures that every EELG
checks availability, while still delaying the check until
construction.  This pattern is used when there are multiple ctors,
as in this class.

Result:
Easier to read code.
