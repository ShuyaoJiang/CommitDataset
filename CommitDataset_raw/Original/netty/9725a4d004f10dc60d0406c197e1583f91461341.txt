Restructuring SslHandler to support new engines

Motivation:

In preparation for support of Conscrypt, I'm consolidating all of the engine-specific details so that it's easier to add new engine types that affect the behavior of SslHandler.

Modifications:

Added an enum SslEngineType that provides SSL engine-specific details.

Result:

SslHandler is more extensible for other engine types.
