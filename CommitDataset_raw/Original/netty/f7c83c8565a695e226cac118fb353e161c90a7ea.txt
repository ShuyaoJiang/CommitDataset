Don't enforce JZlibDecoder on JDK7+, close #4707

Motivation:

`JdkZlibDecoder` is available since Netty 4.0.8 and works with JDK7+.
However, `io.netty.noJdkZlibDecoder` System prop evaluation always defaults to
true, causing Netty to always use JZLib when decompressing on the
client side when the property insn't explictly set to `false`.

Modifications:

Default to `false` instead of `true` when JDK7+.

Result:

JZLib optional as expected on JDK7+.
