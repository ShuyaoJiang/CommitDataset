Expose Helper to obtain the "best" mac address.

Motivation:

The implementation of obtaining the best possible mac address is very good. There are many sub-par implementations proposed on stackoverflow.
While not strictly a netty concern, it would be nice to offer this util also to netty users.

Modifications:

extract DefaultChannelId#defaultMachineId code obtaining the "best" mac into a new helper called MacAddress, keep the random bytes fallback in DefaultChannelID.

Result:

New helper available.
