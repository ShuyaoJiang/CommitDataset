Use NetUtil.LOCALHOST4 instead of InetAddress.getLocalHost()

Motivation:

On ubuntu, InetAddress.getLocalHost() will return 127.0.1.1 this causes some tests to fail.
NetUtil.LOCALHOST4 is more portable.

Modifications:

Made changes in EpollSocketTcpMd5Test to make test passing on ubuntu.

Result:

EpollSocketTcpMd5Test now also passes on ubuntu.
