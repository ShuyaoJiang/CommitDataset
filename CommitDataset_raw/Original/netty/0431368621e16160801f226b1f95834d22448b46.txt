HttpUtil#is100ContinueExpected clean up (#8740)

Motivation:

Current implementation extract header value as String. We have an idiomatic way for checking presence of a header value.

Modification:

Use HttpHeaders#contains for checking if if contains Expect: 100-continue.

Result:

Use idiomatic way + simplify boolean logic.
