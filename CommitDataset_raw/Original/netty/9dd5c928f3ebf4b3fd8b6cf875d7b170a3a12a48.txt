Add java-doc for implemented methods of io.netty.util.concurrent.Future#cancel(boolean mayInterruptIfRunning)

Motivation:

The methods implement io.netty.util.concurrent.Future#cancel(boolean mayInterruptIfRunning) which actually ignored the param mayInterruptIfRunning.We need to add comments for the `mayInterruptIfRunning` param.

Modifications:

Add comments for the `mayInterruptIfRunning` param.

Result:

People who call the `cancel` method will be more clear about the effect of `mayInterruptIfRunning` param.
