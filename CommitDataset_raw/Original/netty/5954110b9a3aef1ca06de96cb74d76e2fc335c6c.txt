Use ByteBufUtil.BYTE_ARRAYS ThreadLocal temporary arrays in more places (#8464)

Motivation:

#8388 introduced a reusable ThreadLocal<byte[]> for use in
decodeString(...). It can be used in more places in the buffer package
to avoid temporary allocations of small arrays.

Modifications:

Encapsulate use of the ThreadLocal in a static package-private
ByteBufUtil.threadLocalTempArray(int) method, and make use of it from a
handful of new places including ByteBufUtil.readBytes(...).

Result:

Fewer short-lived small byte array allocations.
