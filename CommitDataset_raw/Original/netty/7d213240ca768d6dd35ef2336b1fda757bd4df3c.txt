HttpConversionUtil TE filtering robustness

Motivation:
HttpConversionUtil#toHttp2Headers has special code to filter the TE header name. However this filtering code may result in adding the <TE, TRAILERS> tuple in scenarios that are not appropriate. For example if a value containing trailers is seen it will be added, but the value could not actually be equal to trailers. Also CSV values are not supported.

Modifications:
- Account for CSV header values
- Account for the value containing 'trailers' but not actually being equal to 'trailers'

Result:
More robust parsing of the TE header.
