Use offset finding eol avoid repeated scaning.

Motivation:

A large frame will be componsed by many packages. Every time the package
arrived, findEndOfLine will be called from the start of the buffer. It
will cause the complexity of reading frame equal to  O(n^2). This can be
eliminated by using a offset to mark the last scan position, when new
package arrived, just find the delimter from the mark. The complexity
will be O(n).

Modification:

Add a offset to mark the last scan position.

Result:

Better performance for read large frame.
