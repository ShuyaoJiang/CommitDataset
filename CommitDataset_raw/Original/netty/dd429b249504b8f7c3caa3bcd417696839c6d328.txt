Small fixes and improvements

Motivation:

Fix some typos in Netty.

Modifications:

- Fix potentially dangerous use of non-short-circuit logic in Recycler.transfer(Stack<?>).
- Removed double 'the the' in javadoc of EmbeddedChannel.
- Write to log an exception message if we can not get SOMAXCONN in the NetUtil's static block.
