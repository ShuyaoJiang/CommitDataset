Consolidate creation of SslHandshakeException when caused by a callback that is used in the native SSL implementation. (#8979)

Motivation:

We have multiple places where we store the exception that was produced by a callback in ReferenceCountedOpenSslEngine, and so have a lot of code-duplication.

Modifications:

- Consolidate code into a package-private method that is called from the callbacks if needed

Result:

Less code-duplication and cleaner code.
