Ensure flowController().writePendingBytes() is triggered when writing response in example

Motivation:

We called ctx.flush() which is not correct as it will not call flowController().writePendingBytes().

Modifications:

Call flush(ChannelHandlerContext) and so also call flowController().writePendingBytes().

Result:

Correct http2 example
