Allow to schedule tasks up to Long.MAX_VALUE (#7972)

Motivation:

We should allow to schedule tasks with a delay up to Long.MAX_VALUE as we did pre 4.1.25.Final.

Modifications:

Just ensure we not overflow and put the correct max limits in place when schedule a timer. At worse we will get a wakeup to early and then schedule a new timeout.

Result:

Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/7970.
