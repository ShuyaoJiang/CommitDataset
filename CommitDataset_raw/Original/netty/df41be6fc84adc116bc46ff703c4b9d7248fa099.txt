HTTP/2 Decoder validate that GOAWAY lastStreamId doesn't increase

Motivation:
The HTTP/2 RFC states in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-6.8 that Endpoints MUST NOT increase the value they send in the last stream identifier however we don't enforce this when decoding GOAWAY frames.

Modifications:
- Throw a connection error if the peer attempts to increase the lastStreamId in a GOAWAY frame

Result:
RFC is more strictly enforced.
