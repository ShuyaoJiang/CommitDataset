Use GitHub Issue/PR Template Feature

Motivation:
GitHub recently added the ability to setup PR and Issue templates https://github.com/blog/2111-issue-and-pull-request-templates. We should take advantage of this feature to ensure Issues / PRs are properly formed.

Modifications:
- add a .github directory with a CONTRIBUTING.md, ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md, and PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md file

Result:
Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/6074.
