Fix length calculation in AsciiString.indexOf(...) and so eliminate ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. (#8116)

Motivation:

We incorrectly calculated the length that was used for our for loop in AsciiString.indexOf(...). This lead to a possible ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

Modifications:

- Not include the start in the length calculation
- Add unit test.

Result:

Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/8112.
