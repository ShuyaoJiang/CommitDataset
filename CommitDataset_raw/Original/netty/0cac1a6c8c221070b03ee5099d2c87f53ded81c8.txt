H2C upgrades should be ineligible for flow control (#7400)

H2C upgrades should be ineligible for flow control

Motivation:

When the h2c upgrade request is too big, the Http2FrameCodec complains
it's too big for flow control reasons, even though it's ineligible for
flow control.

Modifications:

Specially mark upgrade streams and make Http2FrameCodec know not to try
to flow control on those streams.

Result:

Servers won't barf when they receive an upgrade request with a fat
payload.

[Fixes #7280]
