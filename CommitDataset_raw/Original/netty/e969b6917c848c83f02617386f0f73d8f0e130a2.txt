Let CombinedChannelDuplexHandler correctly handle exceptionCaught. Related to [#4528]

Motivation:

ChannelInboundHandler and ChannelOutboundHandler both can implement exceptionCaught(...) method and so we need to dispatch to both of them.

Modifications:

- Correctly first dispatch exceptionCaught to the ChannelInboundHandler but also make sure the next handler it will be dispatched to will be the ChannelOutboundHandler
- Add removeInboundHandler() and removeOutboundHandler() which allows to remove one of the combined handlers
- Let *Codec extends it and not ChannelHandlerAppender
- Remove ChannelHandlerAppender

Result:

Correctly handle events and also have same behavior as in 4.0
