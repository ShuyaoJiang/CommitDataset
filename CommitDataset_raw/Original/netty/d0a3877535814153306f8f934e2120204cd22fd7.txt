Ensure trying to recover from exceptionCaught on the ServerChannel works as expected

Motivation:

When "Too many open files" happens,the URLClassLoader cannot do any classloading because URLClassLoader need a FD  for findClass. Because of this the anonymous inner class that is created to re-enable auto read may cause a problem.

Modification:

Pre-create Runnable that is scheduled and so ensure it is not lazy loaded.

Result:

No more problems when try to recover.
