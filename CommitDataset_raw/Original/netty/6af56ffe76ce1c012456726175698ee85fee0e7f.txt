HPACK Encoder headerFields improvements

Motivation:
HPACK Encoder has a data structure which is similar to a previous version of DefaultHeaders. Some of the same improvements can be made.

Motivation:
- Enforce the restriction that the Encoder's headerFields length must be a power of two so we can use masking instead of modulo
- Use AsciiString.hashCode which already has optimizations instead of having yet another hash code algorithm in Encoder

Result:
Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/5357
