EPOLL Cached ECONNREFUSED Exception

Motivation:
ECONNREFUSED can be a common type of exception when attempting to finish the connection process. Generating a new exception each time can be costly and quickly bloat memory usage.

Modifications:
- Expose ECONNREFUSED from JNI and cache this exception in Socket.finishConnect

Result:
ECONNREFUSED during finish connect doesn't create a new exception each time.
