Ensure valid message sequence if channel is closed before receive headers.

Motivation:

When the channel is closed while we still decode the headers we currently not preserve correct message sequence. In this case we should generate an invalid message with a current cause.

Modifications:

Create an invalid message with a PrematureChannelClosureException as cause when the channel is closed while we decode the headers.

Result:

Correct message sequence preserved and correct DecoderResult if the channel is closed while decode headers.
