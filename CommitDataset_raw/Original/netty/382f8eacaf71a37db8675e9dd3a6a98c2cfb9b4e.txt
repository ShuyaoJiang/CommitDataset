Correctly fail all promises SSLENGINE_CLOSED once the engine is closed

Motivation:

We should fail all promises with the correct SSLENGINE_CLOSED exception one the engine is closed. We did not fail the current promise with this exception if the ByteBuf was not readable.

Modifications:

Correctly fail promises.

Result:

More correct handling of promises if the SSLEngine is closed.
