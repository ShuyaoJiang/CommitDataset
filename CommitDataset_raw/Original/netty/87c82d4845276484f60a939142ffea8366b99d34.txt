Do not consider PortUnreachableException to require channel closure

Motivation:

When a datagram packet is sent to a destination where nobody actually listens to,
the server O/S will respond with an ICMP Port Unreachable packet.
The ICMP Port Unreachable packet is translated into PortUnreachableException by JDK.
PortUnreachableException is not a harmful exception that prevents a user from sending a datagram.
Therefore, we should not close a datagram channel when PortUnreachableException is caught.

Modifications:

- Do not close a channel when the caught exception is PortUnreachableException.

Result:

A datagram channel is not closed unexpectedly anymore.
