HeadContext is inbound and outbound (#8592)

Motivation:

Our HeadContext in DefaultChannelPipeline does handle inbound and outbound but we only marked it as outbound. While this does not have any effect in the current code-base it can lead to problems when we change our internals (this is also how I found the bug).

Modifications:

Construct HeadContext so it is also marked as handling inbound.

Result:

More correct code.
