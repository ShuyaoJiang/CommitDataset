[#5551] Fix sporadic GlobalEventExecutorTest.testAutomaticStartStop test failure

Motivation:

We saw some sporadic test failures for GlobalEventExecutorTest.testAutomaticStartStop test. This is caused parallel execution of tests in combination with assert checks that will be affected.

Modifications:

Remove fragile assert checks.

Result:

No more sporadic test failures
