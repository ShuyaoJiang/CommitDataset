[#5062] Mark MqttEncoder @Sharable

Motivation:

Commit 2696778 changed MqttEncoder to be a singelton but missed to add @Sharable annotation. This broke the encoder as it can not be added to multiple pipelines.

Modifications:

Add @Sharable annotation

Result:

MqttEncoder can be used in multiple pipelines again.
