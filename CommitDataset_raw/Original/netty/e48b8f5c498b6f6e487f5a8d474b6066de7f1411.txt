[#3539] Correctly handle EPOLLRDHUP

Motivation:

As we missed to correctly handle EPOLLRDHUP we produce an IOException which is unnessary. This leads
to have exceptionCaught(...) methods called.

Modifications:

When EPOLLRDHUP was received just close the socket and fail all pending writes.

Result:

Correctly handle of EPOLLRDHUP and so not miss-leading exceptions.
