[#5760] Do not change writerIndex when decode DnsPtrRecord

Motivation:

We need to not change the original writerIndex when decode a DnsPtrRecord as otherwise we will not be able to decode other records that follow it.

Modifications:

Slice the data out and so not increase the writerIndex.

Result:

No more problems when decoding.
