Allow to generate a jmh uber jar to run benchmarks easily from cmdline with different arguments. (#8264)

Motivation:

It is sometimes useful to be able to run benchmarks easily from the commandline and passs different arguments / options here. We should support this.

Modifications:

Add the benchmark-jar profile which allows to generate such an "uber-jar" that can be used directly to run benchmarks as documented at http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/.

Result:

More flexible way to run benchmarks.
