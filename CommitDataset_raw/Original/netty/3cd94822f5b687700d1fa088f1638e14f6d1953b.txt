Generate heap and thread dump when some tests fail

Motivation:

We have a few sporadic test failures which are only easily reproduceable
in our CI machine.  To get more information about the failure, we need
heap and full thread dump at the moment of failure.

Modifications:

- Add TestUtils.dump() method to dump heap and threads
- Modify SocketGatheringWriteTest and SocketSslEchoTest to call
  TestUtils.dump() on failure

Result:

We get more information about the test failure.
