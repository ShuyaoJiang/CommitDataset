Ensure SslUtils and so SslHandler works when using with Little-Endian buffers.

Motivation:

We not correctly handle LE buffers when try to read the packet length out of the buffer and just assume it always is a BE buffer.

Modifications:

Correctly account for the endianess of the buffer when reading the packet lenght.

Result:

Fixes [#6709].
