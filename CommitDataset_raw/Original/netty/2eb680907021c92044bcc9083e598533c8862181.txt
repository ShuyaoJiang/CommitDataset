Correct OSGi manifests in source jars

Related: #3886

Motivation:

We were including OSGi manifests in sources/javadoc JARs, and OSGi
container treats them as correct dependencies when resolving from OBR
repository, which is incorrect. Runtime fails with non-descriptive
ClassNotFoundException as a result.

Modifications:

- Do not include the OSGi manifests in sources/javadoc JARs
- Include Eclipse-related manifest entries in sources/javadoc JARs

Result:

Better OSGi compatibility
