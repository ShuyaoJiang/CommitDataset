Ensure ObjectCleaner will also be used when FastThreadLocal.set is used.

Motivation:

e329ca1 introduced the user of ObjectCleaner in FastThreadLocal but we missed the case to register our cleaner task if FastThreadLocal.set was called only.

Modifications:

- Use ObjectCleaner also when FastThreadLocal.set is used.
- Add test case.

Result:

ObjectCleaner is always used.
