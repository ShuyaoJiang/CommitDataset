[#2720] Check if /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn exists before try to parse it

Motivation:

As /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn does not exists on non-linux platforms you see a noisy stacktrace when debug level is enabled while the static method of NetUtil is executed.

Modifications:

Check if the file exists before try to parse it.

Result:

Less noisy logging on non-linux platforms.
