[#4331] Helper methods to get charset from Content-Type header of HttpMessage

Motivation:

HttpHeaders already has specific methods for such popular and simple headers like "Host", but if I need to convert POST raw body to string I need to parse complex ContentType header in my code.

Modifications:

Add getCharset and getCharsetAsString methods to parse charset from Content-Length header.

Result:

Easy to use utility method.
