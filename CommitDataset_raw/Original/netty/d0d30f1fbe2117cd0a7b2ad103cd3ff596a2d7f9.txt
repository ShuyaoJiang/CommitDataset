Loosen bounds check on CompositeByteBuf's maxNumComponents (#8621)


Motivation:

In versions of Netty prior to 4.1.31.Final, a CompositeByteBuf could be
created with any size (including potentially nonsensical negative
values). This behavior changed in e7737b993, which introduced a bounds
check to only allow for a component size greater than one. This broke
some existing use cases that attempted to create a byte buf with a
single component.

Modifications:

Lower the bounds check on numComponents to include the single component
case, but still throw an exception for anything less than one.

Add unit tests for the case of numComponents being less than, equal to,
and greater than this lower bound.

Result:

Return to the behavior of 4.1.30.Final, allowing one component, but
still include an explicit check against a lower bound.

Note that while creating a CompositeByteBuf with a single component is
in some ways a contradiction of the term "composite", this patch caters
for existing uses while excluding the clearly nonsensical case of asking
for a CompositeByteBuf with zero or fewer components.

Fixes #8613.
