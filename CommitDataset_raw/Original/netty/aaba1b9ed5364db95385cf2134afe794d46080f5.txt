Accept over 2^31-1 MAX_HEADER_LIST_SIZE

Motivation:

The MAX_HEADER_LIST_SIZE of SETTINGS is represented by
unsigned 32-bit value and this value isn't limited in RFC7540.
But in current implementation, its stored to int variable so
over 2^31-1 value is recognized as minus and handled as
PROTOCOL_ERROR.

Modifications:

If a value of MAX_HEADER_LIST_SIZE is larger than 2^31-1, its
handled as 2^31-1

Result:

Over 2^31-1 MAX_HEADER_LIST_SIZE is became acceptable
