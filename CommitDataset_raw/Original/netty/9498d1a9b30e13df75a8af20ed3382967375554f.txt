Allow to create a JdkSslContext from an existing JDK SSLContext. Related to [#5095] and [#4929]

Motivation:

Sometimes a user only has access to a preconfigured SSLContext but still would like to use our ssl sub-system. For this situations it would be very useful if the user could create a JdkSslContext instance from an existing SSLContext.

Modifications:

- Create new public constructors in JdkSslContext which allow to wrap an existing SSLContext and make the class non-abstract
- Mark JdkSslServerContext and JdkSslClientContext as deprecated as the user should not directly use these.

Result:

It's now possible to create an JdkSslContext from an existing SSLContext.
