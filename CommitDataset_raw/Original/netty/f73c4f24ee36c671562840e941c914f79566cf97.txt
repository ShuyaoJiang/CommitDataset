HTTP/2 HPACK Bounds Check Fix

Motivation:
21e8d84b7961c36435714cdb16eec31ad08213bc changed the way bounds checking was done, but however a bounds check in the case of READ_LITERAL_HEADER_NAME_LENGTH_PREFIX was using an old value. This would delay when the bounds check would actually be done and potentially allow more allocation than necessary.

Modifications:
- Use the new length (index) in the bounds check instead of an old length (nameLength) which had not yet been assigned to the new value.

Result:
More correct bounds checking.
