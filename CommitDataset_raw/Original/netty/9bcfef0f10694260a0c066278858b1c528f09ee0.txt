Fix incoherence in WebSocket example

Motivation:

The logic in the current websocket example is confusing and misleading

Modifications:

Remove occurrences of "http" and "https" and replace them with "ws" and "wss"

Result:

The example code is now coherent and is easier to understand for a new user.
