NioEventLoop should also use our special SelectionKeySet on Java9 and later. (#8260)

Motivation:

In Java8 and earlier we used reflection to replace the used key set if not otherwise told. This does not work on Java9 and later without special flags as its not possible to call setAccessible(true) on the Field anymore.

Modifications:

- Use Unsafe to instrument the Selector with out special set when sun.misc.Unsafe is present and we are using Java9+.

Result:

NIO transport produce less GC on Java9 and later as well.
