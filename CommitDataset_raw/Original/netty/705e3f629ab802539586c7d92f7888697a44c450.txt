Not use InternalThreadLocalMap where access may be done from outside the EventLoop.

Motivation:

We should not use the InternalThreadLocalMap where access may be done from outside the EventLoop as this may create a lot of memory usage while not be reused anyway.

Modifications:

Not use InternalThreadLocalMap in places where the code-path will likely be executed from outside the EventLoop.

Result:

Less memory bloat.
