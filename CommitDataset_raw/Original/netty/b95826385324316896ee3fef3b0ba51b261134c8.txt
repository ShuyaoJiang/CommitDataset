Send full response for unsupported websocket versions

Motivation:

WebSocketServerHandshakerFactory.sendUnsupportedVersionResponse does not
send a LastHttpContent, nor does it flush, and it doesn't send a content
length.

Modifications:

Changed sendUnsupportedVersionResponse to send FullHttpResponse, to
writeAndFlush, and to set a content length of 0. Also added a test for
this method.

Result:

Upstream handlers will be able to determine the end of the response, the
response will actually get written to the client, and the client will be
able to determine the end of the response.
