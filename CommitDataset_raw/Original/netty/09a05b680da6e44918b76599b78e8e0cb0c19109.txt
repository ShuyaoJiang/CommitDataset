Dont use ThreadDeathWatcher to cleanup PoolThreadCache if FastThreadLocalThread with wrapped Runnable is used

Motivation:

We dont need to use the ThreadDeathWatcher if we use a FastThreadLocalThread for which we wrap the Runnable and ensure we call FastThreadLocal.removeAll() once the Runnable completes.

Modifications:

- Dont use a ThreadDeathWatcher if we are sure we will call FastThreadLocal.removeAll()
- Add unit test.

Result:

Less overhead / running theads if you only allocate / deallocate from FastThreadLocalThreads.
