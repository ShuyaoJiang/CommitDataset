Explicit thread group on DefaultThreadFactory.

Motivation:

Fixes #5084. We (gRPC) encountered a bug that was triggered by
grpc/grpc-java@d927180. After that commit, event loop threads are
created per task by NioEventLoopGroup, and inherits the thread group of
the caller, which in our case is an application-provided request-scope
thread. Things go south when the application tries to manipulate (e.g.,
interrupt and join) all threads of the request-scope thread group, which
unexpectedly include the event loop threads.

Modifications:

DefaultThreadFactory will save the current thread group in constructor,
and apply it to all new threads.

Result:

Threads created by DefaultThreadFactory will be in the same thread group
as the thread where the factory is created.
