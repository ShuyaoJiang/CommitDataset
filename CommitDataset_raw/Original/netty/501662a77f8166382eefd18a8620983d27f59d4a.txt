Use long for http2 ping payload.

Motivation:

At the moment we use a ByteBuf as the payload for a http2 frame. This complicates life-time management a lot with no real gain and also may produce more objects then needed. We should just use a long as it is required to be 8 bytes anyway.

Modifications:

Use long for ping payloads.

Result:

Fixes [#7629].
