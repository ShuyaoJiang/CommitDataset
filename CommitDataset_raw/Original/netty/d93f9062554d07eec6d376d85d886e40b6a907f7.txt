[#4198] Fix race-condition when allocate from multiple-thread.

Motivation:

Fix a race condition that was introduced by f18990a8a507d52fc40416d169db340105b10ec0 that could lead to a NPE when allocate from the PooledByteBufAllocator concurrently by many threads.

Modifications:

Correctly synchronize on the PoolSubPage head.

Result:

No more race.
