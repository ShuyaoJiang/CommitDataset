Swap to SslContextBuilder in examples

Motivation:

Using factory methods of SslContext is deprecated. Code should be using
SslContextBuilder instead. This would have been done when the old
methods were deprecated, but memcache and http2 examples didn't exist in
the 4.0 branch which the PR was against.

Modifications:

Swap to the new construction pattern.

Result:

No more deprecated warnings during build of examples. Users are
instructed to use the new pattern.
