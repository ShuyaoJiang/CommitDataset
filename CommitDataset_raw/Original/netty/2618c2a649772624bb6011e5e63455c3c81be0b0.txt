[#5239] Allow adding handlers to pipeline with null name.

Motivation:

While doing 8fe3c83e4ca9a64c03f5adcb9f056d9e9440a389 I made a change which disallowed using null as name for handlers in the pipeline (this generated a new name before).

Modifications:

Revert to old behaviour and adding test case.

Result:

Allow null name again
