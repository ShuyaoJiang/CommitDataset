Ensure calling ReferenceCountedOpenSslEngine.wrap(...) after closeOutbound() was called will not throw an SSLException

Motivation:

PR [#6238] added guards to be able to call wrap(...) / unwrap(...) after the engine was shutdown. Unfortunally one case was missed which is when closeOutbound() was called and produced some data while closeInbound() was not called yet.

Modifications:

Correctly guard against SSLException when closeOutbound() was called, produced data and someone calls wrap(...) after it.

Result:

No more SSLException. Fixes [#6260].
