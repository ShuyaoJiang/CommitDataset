Allow to wrap another SslContext implementation and do extra init steps on the SSLEngine.

Motivation:

Sometimes its needed to customize the SSLEngine (like setting protocols etc). For this it would be useful if the user could wrap an SslContext and do init steps on the SSLEngine.

Modifications:

Add new SslContext implementation which can wrap another one and allow to customize the SSLEngine

Result:

More flexible usage of SslContext.
