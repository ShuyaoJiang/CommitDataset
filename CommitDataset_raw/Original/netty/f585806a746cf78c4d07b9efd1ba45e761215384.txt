[#5598] Ensure SslHandler not log false-positives when try to close the channel due timeout.

Motivation:

When we try to close the Channel due a timeout we need to ensure we not log if the notification of the promise fails as it may be completed in the meantime.

Modifications:

Add another constructor to ChannelPromiseNotifier and PromiseNotifier which allows to log on notification failure.

Result:

No more miss-leading logs.
