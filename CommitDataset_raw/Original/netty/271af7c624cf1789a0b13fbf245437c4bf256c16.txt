Expose metrics for PooledByteBufAllocator

Motivation:

The PooledByteBufAllocator is more or less a black-box atm. We need to expose some metrics to allow the user to get a better idea how to tune it.

Modifications:

- Expose different metrics via PooledByteBufAllocator
- Add *Metrics interfaces

Result:

It is now easy to gather metrics and detail about the PooledByteBufAllocator and so get a better understanding about resource-usage etc.
