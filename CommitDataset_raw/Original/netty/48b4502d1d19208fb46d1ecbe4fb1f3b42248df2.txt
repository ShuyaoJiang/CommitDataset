Move EmptyHttpHeaders.INSTANCE initialization to inner class.

Motivation:

If the HttpUtil class is initialized before HttpHeaders or
EmptyHttpHeaders, EmptyHttpHeaders.INSTANCE will be null. This
can lead to NPEs in code that relies on this field being
non-null. One example is the
LastHttpContent.EMPTY_LAST_CONTENT.trailingHeaders method.

Modifications:

- Move HttpUtil.EMPTY_HEADERS to a private static final inner class
  of EmptyHttpHeaders called InstanceInitializer.
- Add tests, that when run in isolation, validate the fix for the issue.

Result:

Any initialization order of HttpUtil, EmptyHttpHeaders or
HttpHeaders will result in EmptyHttpHeaders.INSTANCE being initialized
correctly.
