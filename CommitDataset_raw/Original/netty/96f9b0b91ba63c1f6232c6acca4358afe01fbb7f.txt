Remote flow controller incorrectly updates stream state

Motivation:

The `DefaultHttp2RemoteFlowController` does not correctly determine `hasFrame` when updating the stream state for the distributor. Adding a check to enforce `hasFrame` when `streamableBytes > 0` causes several test failures.

Modifications:

Modified `DefaultHttp2RemoteFlowController` to simplify the writing logic and to correct the bookkeeping for `hasFrame`.

Result:

The distributors are always called with valid arguments.
