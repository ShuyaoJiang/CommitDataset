Use InetSocketAddress.getHostName() instead of getHostString()

Related: #3478

Motivation:

DefaultNameResolver uses InetSocketAddress.getHostString() instead of
getHostName(). Because Netty uses the DefaultNameResolver by default and
getHostString() is available only since Java 7, a user cannot use Netty
on Java 6 anymore.

Modifications:

Use InetSocketAddress.getHostName() which is practically same and also
is available in Java 6.

Result:

Netty 4.1 runs on Java 6 again.
