Increase test timeout for SocketStringEchoTest

Motivation:
SocketStringEchoTest has been observed to fail on CI servers, but the stack traces still indicate work was being done.

Modifications:
- Increase the test timeout

Result:
Tests have more time to complete, and hopefully less false positive test failures.
