codec-http2: Stop leaking in header downgrader test

Motivation:

We're leaking requests in our Http2ServerDowngrader tests when we
allocate a buffer using the local allocator.

Modification:

Release the request later when the request is constructed with the local
allocator.

Result:

Less leaky tests.
