Overall clean-up of ipfilter package

Motivation:

Recently merged ipfilter package has the following problems:
* AbstractIpFilterHandler could be improved to support any SocketAddress types rather than only InetSocketAddress.
* AbstractIpFilterHandler can be removed immediately after decision is made rather than keeping the outcome of the decision as an attribute.
* AbstractIpFilterHandler doesn't have a hook for the accepted addresses.
* The hook method (reject()) needs to be named in line with other handler methods (i.e. channelRejected())
* IpFilterRuleHandler should allow accepting zero rules - it's particularly useful for machine-configured setup (i.e. specifying zero rules disables ipfilter).
* IpFilterRuleType.ALLOW/DENY should be ACCEPT/REJECT for consistency.

Modifications:

* AbstractIpFilterHandler has been renamed to AbstractRemoteAddressFilter and now uses type parameter.
* Added channelAccepted() and renamed reject() to channelRejected()
* Added ChannelHandlerContext as a parameter of accept() so that accept() can add a listener to the closeFuture() of the channel. This way, UniqueIpFilter continue working even if we remove the filtering handler early.
* Various renames
  * IpFilterRuleHandler -> RuleBasedIpFilter
  * UniqueIpFilterHandler -> UniqueIpFilter

Result:

* Much cleaner API with more extensibility
