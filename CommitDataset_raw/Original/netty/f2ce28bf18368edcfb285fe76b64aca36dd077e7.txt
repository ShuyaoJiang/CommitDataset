Satisfy write promise when writing an Http2WindowUpdateFrame to Http2FrameCodec.

Motivation:

When writing an Http2WindowUpdateFrame to an Http2FrameCodec, the
ChannelPromise is never satisfied, so callers cannot generically rely on the
write future being satisfied on success.

Modifications:

When writing Http2WindowUpdateFrame, Http2FrameCodec now satisfies the
ChannelPromise immediately.

Result:

The write future is satisfied on successful writes.

Fixes netty/netty#5530.
