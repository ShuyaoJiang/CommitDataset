Add h2spec test suite module to check if netty http2 implementation conforms with the specification

Motivation:

H2Spec is a conformance testing tool for HTTP/2 implementation.
To help us fix failing tests and avoid future regression we
should run h2spec as part of the build

Modifications:

- Add testsuite-http2 module to the project

Result:

- Run h2spec as part of the build
- 22 tests are currently ignored, we should remove the ignore as we fix them
