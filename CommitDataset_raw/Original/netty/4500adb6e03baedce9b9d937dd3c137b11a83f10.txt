Updates the javadoc of Unpooled to remove mention to methods it does not provide

Motivation:

`Unpooled` javadoc's mentioned the generation of hex dump and swapping an integer's byte order,
which are actually provided by `ByteBufUtil`.

Modifications:

 Sentence moved to `ByteBufUtil` javadoc.

Result:

`Unpooled` javadoc is correct.
