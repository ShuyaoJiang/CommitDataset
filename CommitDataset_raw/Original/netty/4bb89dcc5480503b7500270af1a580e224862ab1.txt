Correctly handle connect/disconnect in EpollDatagramChannel / KQueueDatagramChannel

Motivation:

We did not correctly handle connect() and disconnect() in EpollDatagramChannel / KQueueDatagramChannel and so the behavior was different compared to NioDatagramChannel.

Modifications:

- Correct implement connect and disconnect methods
- Share connect and related code
- Add tests

Result:

EpollDatagramChannel / KQueueDatagramChannel also supports correctly connect() and disconnect() methods.
