Correct typo in artifactId of dependency in bom pom.xml

Motivation:

There was a typo in a dependency in the bom pom.xml which lead to have it specify a non-existing artifact and also so not have the maven release plugin update the version correctly.

Modifications:

Rename netty-transport-unix-common to netty-transport-native-unix-common and also fix the version.

Result:

Fixes [#6979]
