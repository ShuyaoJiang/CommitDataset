[#3789] Correctly reset markers for all allocations when using PooledByteBufAllocator

Motivation:

We need to ensure all markers are reset when doing an allocation via the PooledByteBufAllocator. This was not the always the case.

Modifications:

Move all logic that needs to get executed when reuse a PooledByteBuf into one place and call it.

Result:

Correct behavior
