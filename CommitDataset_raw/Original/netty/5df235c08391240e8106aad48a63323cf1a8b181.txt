Correcting Maven Dependencies (#8622)

Motivation:

Most of the maven modules do not explicitly declare their
dependencies and rely on transitivity, which is not always correct.

Modifications:

For all maven modules, add all of their dependencies to pom.xml

Result:

All of the (essentially non-transitive) depepdencies of the modules are explicitly declared in pom.xml
