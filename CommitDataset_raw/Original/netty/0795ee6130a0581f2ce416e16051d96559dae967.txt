Add more test cases to ZlibTest

Motivation:

Currently, we only test our ZlibEncoders against our ZlibDecoders. It is
convenient to write such tests, but it does not necessarily guarantee
their correctness. For example, both encoder and decoder might be faulty
even if the tests pass.

Modifications:

Add another test that makes sure that our GZIP encoder generates the
GZIP trailer, using the fact that GZIPInputStream raises an EOFException
when GZIP trailer is missing.

Result:

More coverage for GZIP compression
