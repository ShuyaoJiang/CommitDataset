Fix Native EPOLL Build Failure

Motiviation:
If sendmmsg is already defined then the native epoll module failed to build because of conflicting definitions.
The mmsghdr type was also redefined on systems that already supported this structure.

Modifications:
Provide a way so that systems which already define sendmmsg and mmsghdr can build
Provide a way so that systems which don't define sendmmsg and mmsghdr can build

Result:
The native EPOLL module can build in more environments
