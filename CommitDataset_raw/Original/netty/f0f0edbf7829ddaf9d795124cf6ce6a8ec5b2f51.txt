HttpObjectAggregator adds 'Connection: close' header if necessary

Motivation:

The HttpObjectAggregator never appends a 'Connection: close' header to
the response of oversized messages even though in the majority of cases
its going to close the connection.

Modification:

This PR addresses that by ensuring the requisite header is present when
the connection is going to be closed.

Result:

Gracefully signal that we are about to close the connection.
