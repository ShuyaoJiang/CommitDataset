[#4087] Correctly forward bytes when remove codec and handle channelInactive / channelReadComplete(...)

Motivation:

We missed to correctly implement the handlerRemoved(...) / channelInactive(...) and channelReadComplete(...) method, this leaded to multiple problems:

 - Missed to forward bytes when the codec is removed from the pipeline
 - Missed to call decodeLast(...) once the Channel goes in active
 - No correct handling of channelReadComplete that could lead to grow of cumulation buffer.

Modifications:

- Correctly implement methods and forward to the internal ByteToMessageDecoder
- Add unit test.

Result:

Correct behaviour
