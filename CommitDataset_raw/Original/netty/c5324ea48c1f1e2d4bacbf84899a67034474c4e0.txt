Make netty build work on Java9

Motivation:

We missed some stuff in 5728e0eb2cf0d2fe267d25c9f85a0a061dc7ab5f and so the build failed on java9

Modifications:

- Add extra cmdline args when needed
- skip the autobahntestsuite as jython not works with java9
- skip the osgi testsuite as the maven plugin not works with java9

Result:

Build finally passed on java9
