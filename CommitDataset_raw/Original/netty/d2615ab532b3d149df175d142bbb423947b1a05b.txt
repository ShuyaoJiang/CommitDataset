Porting BufferingHttp2ConnectionEncoder from gRPC

Motivation:

gRPC's BufferingHttp2ConnectionEncoder is a generic utility that simplifies client-side applications that want to allow stream creation without worrying about violating the SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS limit.  Since it's not gRPC-specific it makes sense to move it into Netty proper.

Modifications:

Adding the BufferingHttp2ConnectionEncoder and it's unit test.

Result:

Netty now supports buffering stream creation.
