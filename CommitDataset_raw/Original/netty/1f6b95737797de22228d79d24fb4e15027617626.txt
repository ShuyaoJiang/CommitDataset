Ensure we retain the original hostname when connect to a remote peer when using epoll transport.

Motivation:

We should retain the original hostname when connect to a remote peer so the user can still query the origin hostname if getHostString() is used.

Modifications:

Compute a InetSocketAddress from the original remote address and the one returned by the Os.

Result:

Same behavior when using epoll transport and nio transport.
