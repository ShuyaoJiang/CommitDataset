Lazily instantiate HttpServerUpgradeHandler.UpgradeCodec

Related: #3814

Motivation:

To implement the support for an upgrade from cleartext HTTP/1.1
connection to cleartext HTTP/2 (h2c) connection, a user usually uses
HttpServerUpgradeHandler.

It does its job, but it requires a user to instantiate the UpgradeCodecs
for all supported protocols upfront. It means redundancy for the
connections that are not upgraded.

Modifications:

- Change the constructor of HttpServerUpgradeHandler
  - Accept UpgraceCodecFactory instead of UpgradeCodecs
- The default constructor of HttpServerUpgradeHandler sets the
  maxContentLength to 0 now, which shouldn't be a problem because a
  usual upgrade request is a GET.
- Update the examples accordingly

Result:

A user can instantiate Http2ServerUpgradeCodec and its related objects
(Http2Connection, Http2FrameReader/Writer, Http2FrameListener, etc) only
when necessary.
