Epoll Shutdown Input Exception Handling

Motivation:
If ChannelOption.ALLOW_HALF_CLOSURE is true and the shutdown input operation fails we should not propagate this exception, and instead consider this socket's read as half closed.

Modifications:
- AbstractEpollChannel.shutdownInput should not propagate exceptions when attempting to shutdown the input, but instead should just close the socket

Result:
Users expecting a ChannelInputShutdownEvent will get this event even if the socket is already shutdown, and the shutdown operation fails.
