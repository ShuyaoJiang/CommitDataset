Use jndi-dns to obtain default name servers

Motivation:

Using reflection to obtain the default name servers may fail in Java9 and also in previous Java versions if a SecurityManager is present.

Modifications:

Try using jndi-dns to obtain default name servers and only try using reflection if this fails.

Result:

Be able to detect default name servers in all cases. Fixes [#6347].
