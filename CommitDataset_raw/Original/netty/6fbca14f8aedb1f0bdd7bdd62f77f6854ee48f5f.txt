Cleaning up the initialization of Http2ConnectionHandler

Motivation:

It currently takes a builder for the encoder and decoder, which makes it difficult to decorate them.

Modifications:

Removed the builders from the interfaces entirely. Left the builder for the decoder impl but removed it from the encoder since it's constructor only takes 2 parameters. Also added decorator base classes for the encoder and decoder and made the CompressorHttp2ConnectionEncoder extend the decorator.

Result:

Fixes #3530
