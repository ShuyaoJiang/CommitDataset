DNS Resolver Search Domain Bugs

Motivation:
The DNS resolver supports search domains. However the ndots are not correctly enforced. The search domain should only be appended under the following scenario [1]:

> Resolver queries having fewer than ndots dots (default is 1) in them will be attempted using each component of the search path in turn until a match is found.

The DNS resolver current appends the search domains if ndots is 0 which should never happen (because no domain can have less than 0 dots).

[1] https://linux.die.net/man/5/resolv.conf

Modifications:
- Parse /etc/resolv.conf to get the default value for ndots on Unix platforms
- The search domain shouldn't be used if ndots is 0
- Avoid failing a promise to trigger the search domain queries in DnsNameResolverContext#resolve

Result:
More correct usage of search domains in the DNS resolver.
