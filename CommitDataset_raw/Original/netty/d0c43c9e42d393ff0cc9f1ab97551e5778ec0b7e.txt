We should prefer heap buffers when using the OIO transport to reduce memory copies.

Motivation:

When using the OIO transport we need to act on byte[] when writing and reading from / to the underyling Socket. So we should ensure we use heap buffers by default to reduce memory copies.

Modifications:

Ensure we prefer heap buffers by default for the OIO transport.

Result:

Possible less memory copies.
