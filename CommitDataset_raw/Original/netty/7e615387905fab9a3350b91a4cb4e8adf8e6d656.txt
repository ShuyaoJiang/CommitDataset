[#2665] Continue writing on IOException when using DatagramChannel

Motivation:

As a DatagramChannel supports to write to multiple remote peers we must not close the Channel once a IOException accours as this error may be only valid for one remote peer.

Modification:

Continue writing on IOException.

Result:

DatagramChannel can be used even after an IOException accours during writing.
