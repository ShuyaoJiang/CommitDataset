Http2LifecycleManager.onException rename

Motivation:
Http2LifecycleManager.onException takes a Throwable as a paramter and not an Exception. There are also onConnectionError and onStreamError methods in the codec. We should rename this method to onError for consistency and clarity.

Modifications:
- Rename Http2LifecycleManager.onException to Http2LifecycleManager.onError

Result:
More consistent and clarified interface.
