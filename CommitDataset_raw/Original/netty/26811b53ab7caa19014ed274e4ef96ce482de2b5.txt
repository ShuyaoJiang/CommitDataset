Adding support for tcnative fedora flavour in uber jar

Motivation:

We want to allow the use of an uber jar that contains shared dynamic libraries for all platforms (including fedora).

Modifications:

Modified OpenSsl to try and load the fedora library if the OS is Linux and the platform specified library fails before using the default lib.

Result:

True uber support.
