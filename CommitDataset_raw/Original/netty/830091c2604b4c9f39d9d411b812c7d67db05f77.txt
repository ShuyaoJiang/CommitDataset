Reduce the default initial capacity of ChannelOutboundBuffer

Motivation:

ChannelOutboundBuffer is basically a circular array queue of its entry
objects.  Once an entry is created in the array, it is never nulled out
to reduce the allocation cost.

However, because it is a circular queue, the array almost always ends up
with as many entry instances as the size of the array, regardless of the
number of pending writes.

At worst case, a channel might have only 1 pending writes at maximum
while creating 32 entry objects, where 32 is the initial capacity of the
array.

Modifications:

- Reduce the initial capacity of the circular array queue to 4.
- Make the initial capacity of the circular array queue configurable

Result:

We spend 4 times less memory for entry objects under certain
circumstances.
