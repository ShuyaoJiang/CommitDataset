Fix small race in DefaultChannelPipeline introduced by a729e0fcd94009905d219665bdd069eb31433b7c

Motivation:

There is a small race while adding handlers to the pipeline because callHandlerAddedForAllHandlers() may not be run when the user calls add* but the Channel is already registered.

Modifications:

Ensure we always delay handlerAdded(..) / handlerRemoved(...) until callHandlerAddedForAllHandlers() was called.

Result:

No more race on pipeline modifications possible.
