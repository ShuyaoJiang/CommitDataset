Implement NIO datagram transport with the new API

- AbstractChannel now handles flushing a message buffer
- Cleaned up DatagramChannel interface
- Removed ProtocolFamily because a user can create an NIO
  DatagramChannel and specify it as a constructor parameter
- UniqueName and UniqueKey constructors became public so that
  I don't need to create a subclass every time.
