Use standard syntax for logging HTTP/2 stream ID.

Motivation:

When looking through the logs for entries pertaining to a specific stream, it's difficult because header entries use the syntax "streamId:<id>" but all other entries use "streamId=<id>". We should make all of the entries consistent.

Modifications:

Changed header entries to use "streamId=<id>" to match the other entries.

Result:

Easier HTTP/2 log navigation.
