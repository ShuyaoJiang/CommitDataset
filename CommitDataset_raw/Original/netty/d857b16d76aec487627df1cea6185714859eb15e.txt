Http/2 RST_STREAM frame robustness

Motivation:
The Http2ConnectionHandler writeRstStream method allows RST_STREAM frames to be sent when we do not know about the stream and after a RST_STREAM frame has already been sent.  This may lead to sending frames when we should not according to the HTTP/2 spec. There is also the potential to notify the closeListener multiple times if the closeStream method is called multiple times.

Modifications:
- Prevent RST_STREAM from being sent if we don't know about the stream, or if we already sent the RST_STREAM.
- Prevent the closeListener from being notified multiple times.

Result:
More robust writeRstStream logic in boundary conditions.
