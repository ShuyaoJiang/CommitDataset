Add removeIfExists() method to DefaultChannelPipeline

Motivation:

Sometimes it is very convenient to remove the handler from pipeline without throwing the exception in case those handler doesn't exist in the pipeline.

Modification:

Added 3 overloaded methods to DefaultChannelPipeline, but not added to ChannelHandler due to back compatibility.

Result:

Fixes #7662
