Implemented FastLZ compression codec

Motivation:

FastLZ compression codec provides sending and receiving data encoded by fast FastLZ algorithm using block mode.

Modifications:

- Added part of `jfastlz` library which implements FastLZ algorithm. See FastLz class.
- Implemented FastLzFramedEncoder which extends MessageToByteEncoder and provides compression of outgoing messages.
- Implemented FastLzFramedDecoder which extends ByteToMessageDecoder and provides uncompression of incoming messages.
- Added integration tests for `FastLzFramedEncoder/Decoder`.

Result:

Full FastLZ compression codec which can compress/uncompress data using FastLZ algorithm.
