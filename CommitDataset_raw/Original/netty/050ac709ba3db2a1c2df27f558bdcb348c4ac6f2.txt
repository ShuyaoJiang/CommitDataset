PromiseNotifier does not propagate cancel events

Motivation:
If the Future that the PromiseNotifier is listening to is cancelled, it does not propagate the cancel to all the promises it is expected to notify.

Modifications:
- If the future is cancelled then all the promises should be cancelled
- Add a UnaryPromiseNotifier if a collection of promises is not necessary

Result:
PromiseNotifier propagates cancel events to all promises
