Allow to disable ResourceLeak creation when worker thread is deamon in HashedWheelTimer

Motivation:

Sometimes a shared HashedWheelTimer can not easily be stopped in a good place. If the worker thread is daemon this is not a big deal and we should allow to not log a leak.

Modifications:

Add another constructor which allows to disable resource leak detection if worker thread is used.

Result:

Not log resource leak when HashedWheelTimer is not stopped and the  worker thread is a deamon thread.
