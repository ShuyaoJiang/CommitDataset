PoolChunkList not correctly move PoolChunks when these are moved.

Motivation:

When a PoolChunk needs to get moved to the previous PoolChunkList because of the minUsage / maxUsage constraints we always just moved it one level which is incorrect and so could lead to have PoolChunks in the wrong PoolChunkList (in respect to their minUsage / maxUsage settings). This then could have the effect that PoolChunks are not released / freed in a timely fashion and so.

Modifications:

- Correctly move PoolChunks between PoolChunkLists, which includes moving it multiple "levels".
- Add unit test

Result:

Correctlty move the PoolChunk to PoolChunkList when it is freed, even if its multiple layers.
