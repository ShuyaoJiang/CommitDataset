Fix incorrect sizing of temp byte arrays in (Unsafe)ByteBufUtil (#8484)

Motivation:

Two similar bugs were introduced by myself in separate recent PRs #8393
and #8464, while optimizing the assignment/handling of temporary arrays
in ByteBufUtil and UnsafeByteBufUtil.

The temp arrays allocated for buffering data written to an OutputStream
are incorrectly sized to the full length of the data to copy rather than
being capped at WRITE_CHUNK_SIZE.

Unfortunately one of these is in the 4.1.31.Final release, I'm really
sorry and will be more careful in future.

This kind of thing is tricky to cover in unit tests.

Modifications:

Revert the temp array allocations back to their original sizes.

Avoid making duplicate calls to ByteBuf.capacity() in a couple of places
in ByteBufUtil (unrelated thing I noticed, can remove it from this PR if
desired!)

Result:

Temporary byte arrays will be reverted to their originally intended
sizes.
