[#2867] Workaround performance issue with IPv4-mapped-on-IPv6 addresses

Motivation:

InetAddress.getByName(...) uses exceptions for control flow when try to parse IPv4-mapped-on-IPv6 addresses. This is quite expensive.

Modifications:

Detect IPv4-mapped-on-IPv6 addresses in the JNI level and convert to IPv4 addresses before pass to InetAddress.getByName(...) (via InetSocketAddress constructor).

Result:

Eliminate performance problem causes by exception creation when parsing IPv4-mapped-on-IPv6 addresses.
