Add @SupressWarnings("deprecation") to ChannelInboundHandlerAdapter and clarify deprecation in ChannelHandler (#9001)

Motivation:

https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8826 added @Deprecated to the exceptionCaught(...) method but we missed to add @SupressWarnings(...) to it's sub-types. Beside this we can make the deprecated docs a bit more clear.

Modifications:

- Add @SupressWarnings("deprecated")
- Clarify docs.

Result:

Less warnings and more clear deprecated docs.
