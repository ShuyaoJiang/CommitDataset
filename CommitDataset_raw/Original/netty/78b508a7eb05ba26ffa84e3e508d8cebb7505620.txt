AbstractHttp2ConnectionHandlerBuilder validateHeaders cannot be set with encoder/decoder

Motivation:
If validateHeaders is set in combination with the encoder/decoder it will be silently ignored. We should enforce the constraint that validateHeaders and encoder/decoder are mutually exclusive.

Modifications:
- Make sure either validateHeaders can be set or encoder/decoder.

Result:
AbstractHttp2ConnectionHandlerBuilder does not allow conflicting options to be set.
