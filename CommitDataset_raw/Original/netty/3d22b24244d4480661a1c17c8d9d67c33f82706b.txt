Allowed Netty Epoll/Kqueue to work in IPv6 Only environments

Motivation:
In some environments, IPv4 may be disabled (at a kernel level).
Google has such an environment for testing v4 -> v6 transition
paths.  This give confidence that code is v6 ready.

Modifications:
Change native socket code to ignore failures of trying to enter
dual stack mode.  This change has been made to Google's internal
JDK, and will/should be upstreamed to OpenJDK eventually.

Results:
Netty works in IPv6 only environments

Fixes: #6993
