Not attempt to read from fd when channel is closed during read loop. Related to [#5031]

Motivation:

We need to break out of the read loop for two reasons:

- If the input was shutdown in between (which may be the case when the user did it in the
  fireChannelRead(...) method we should not try to read again to not produce any
  miss-leading exceptions.

- If the user closes the channel we need to ensure we not try to read from it again as
  the filedescriptor may be re-used already by the OS if the system is handling a lot of
  concurrent connections and so needs a lot of filedescriptors. If not do this we risk
  reading data from a filedescriptor that belongs to another socket then the socket that
  was "wrapped" by this Channel implementation.

Modification:

Break the reading loop if the input was shutdown from within the channelRead(...) method.

Result:

No more meaningless exceptions and no risk to read data from wrong socket after the original was closed.
