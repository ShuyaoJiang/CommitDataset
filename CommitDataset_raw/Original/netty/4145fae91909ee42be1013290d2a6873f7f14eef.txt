HTTP/2 HPACK Decoder VarInt Improvement

Motivation:
HTTP/2 Decoder#decodeULE128 current will tolerate more bytes than necessary when attempted to detect overflow. The usage of this method also currently requires an additional overflow conditional.

Modifications:
- Integrate the first byte into Decoder#decodeULE128 which allows us to detect overflow reliably and avoid overflow checks outside of this method.

Result:
Less conditionals and earlier overflow detection in Decoder#decodeULE128
