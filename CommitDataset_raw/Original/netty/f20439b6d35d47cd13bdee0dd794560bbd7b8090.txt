Various performance optimizations in OpenSslEngine

Motivation:

There are various places in OpenSslEngine wher we can do performance optimizations.

Modifications:

- Reduce JNI calls when possible
- Detect finished handshake as soon as possible
- Eliminate double calculations
- wrap multiple ByteBuffer if possible in a loop

Result:

Better performance
