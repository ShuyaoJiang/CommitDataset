Make Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec truly @Sharable (#8482)

Motivation:
The `Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec` is marked `@Sharable` but mutates
an internal `HttpScheme` field every time it is added to a pipeline.

Modifications:
Instead of storing the `HttpScheme` in the handler we store it as an
attribute on the parent channel.

Result:
Fixes #8480.
