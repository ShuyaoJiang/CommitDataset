Introduce bypass buffer and use it in LoggingHandler

- Added ChannelBufferHolders.(inbound|outbound)BypassBuffer()
  - The holder returned by these methods returns the next handler's
    buffer.  When a handler's new(Inbound|Outbound)Buffer returns
    a bypass holder, your inboundBufferUpdated() and flush()
    implementation should check if the buffer is a bypass and should not
    modify the content of the buffer.
- Channel(Inbound|Outbound)?HandlerAdapter is now abstract.
  - A user has to specify the exact inbound/outbound buffer type
  - It's because there's no way to determine the best buffer type
- Implemented LoggingHandler using the new API.
  - It doesn't dump received or sent messages yet.
- Fixed a bug where DefaultUnsafe.close() does not trigger deregister()
- Fixed a bug where NioSocketChannel.isActive() does not return false
