Using public LogLevel for HTTP/2 frame logging.

Motivation:

The Http2FrameLogger is currently using the internal logging classes. We should change this so that it's using the public classes and then converts internally.

Modifications:

Modified Http2FrameLogger and the examples to use the public LogLevel class.

Result:

Fixes #2512
