Configures HTTP2 pipeline with more proper way

Motivation:

When we use pipeline.replace and we still had ongoing inbound, then
there will be some problem that inbound message would go to wrong
handlers. So we add handler first, and remove self after add, so that
the next handler will be the correct one.

Modifications:

Uses remove after addAfter instead of replace.

Result:

Fixed #6881
