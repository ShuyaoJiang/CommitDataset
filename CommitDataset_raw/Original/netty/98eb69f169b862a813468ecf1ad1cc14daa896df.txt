Remove synchronization overhead on generateName.

Motivation:

Changing the chache of generated names to use a cache per thread. This will remove the bottleneck when many eventloops are used and names need to generate.

Modifications:

Use a FastThreadLocal to store the cached names.

Result:

Less locking between threads.
