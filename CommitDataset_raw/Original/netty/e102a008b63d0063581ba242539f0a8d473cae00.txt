[#5893] Ensure we not close NioDatagramChannel when SocketException is received.

Motivation:

When using java.nio.DatagramChannel we should not close the channel when a SocketException was thrown as we can still use the channel.

Modifications:

Not close the Channel when SocketException is thrown

Result:

More robust and correct handling of exceptions when using NioDatagramChannel.
