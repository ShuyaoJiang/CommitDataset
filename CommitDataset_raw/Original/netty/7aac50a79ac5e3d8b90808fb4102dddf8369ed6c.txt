Optimizing KObjectHashMap hashIndex()

Motivation:

The IntObjectHashMap benchmarks show the Agrona collections to be faster on put, lookup, and remove. One major difference is that we're using 2 modulus operations each time we increment the position index while iterating.  Agrona uses a mask instead.

Modifications:

Modified the KObjectHashMap to use masking rather than modulus when wrapping the position index. This requires that the capacity be a power of 2.

Result:

Improved performance of IntObjectHashMap.
