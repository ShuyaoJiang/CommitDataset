Fix incorrect reachability assumption in ResourceLeakDetector (#8410)

Motivation:

trackedObject != null gives no guarantee that trackedObject remains reachable. This may cause problems related to premature finalization: false leak detector warnings.
 
Modifications:

Add private method reachabilityFence0 that works on JDK 8 and can be factored out into PlatformDependent. Later, it can be swapped for the real Reference.reachabilityFence.
 
Result:

No false leak detector warnings in future versions of JDK.
