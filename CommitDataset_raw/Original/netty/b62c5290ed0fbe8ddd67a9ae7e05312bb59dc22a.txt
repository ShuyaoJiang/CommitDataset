Let SniHandler accept Mapping as well as DominaNameMapping

Related: #4470 #4473

Motivation:

A user might want to:

- implement dynamic mapping from hostname to SslContext
- server large number of domain names whose SslContext can be
  initialized lazily and destroyed when unused

Modifications:

- Let SniHandler accept Mapping<String, SslContext> as well as
  DomainNameMapping
- Make the default constructor of SslContext so that a user can create
  his or her own SslContext wrapper

Result:

Flexibility
