Ensure ReferenceCountedOpenSslEngine not swallow the close_notify

Motivation:

We need to ensure we not swallow the close_notify that should be send back to the remote peer. See [#6167]

Modifications:

- Only call shutdown() in closeInbound() if there is nothing pending that should be send back to the remote peer.
- Return the correct HandshakeStatus when the close_notify was received.
- Only shutdown() when close_notify was received after closeOutbound() was called.

Result:

close_notify is correctly send back to the remote peer and handled when received.
