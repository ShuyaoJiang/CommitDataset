HttpUtil class for Http specific utilities

Motivation:
The HTTP specification defines specific request-targets in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-5.3. Netty does not have a way to distinguish between these differnt types, and there is currently no obvious location where these types of methods would live.

Modifications:
- Add methods to distinguish request-targets as defined in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-5.3

Result:
Common utitlity methods exist to inpsect request-targets.
