Use a default resolver with bootstrap.resolver(null).

Motivation:

`Bootstrap` has a notion of a default resolver group, but it's hidden from the public. To allow callers to reset a `Bootstrap` instance's resolver group, we could either make `DEFAULT_RESOLVER` public, or we could allow callers to pass `null` as an argument to `Bootstrap#resolver(AddressResolverGroup<?>)`. This pull request does the latter.

Modifications:

- Allow `Bootstrap#resolver(AddressResolverGroup<?>)` to accept `null` as an argument

Result:

Callers may pass `null` to `Bootstrap#resolver(AddressResolverGroup<?>)` to cause the `Bootstrap` instance to use its default resolver group.
