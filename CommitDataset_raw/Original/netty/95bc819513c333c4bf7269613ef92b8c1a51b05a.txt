http-proxy: attach headers to connection exception (#8824)

Motivation:
When a proxy fails to connect, it includes useful error detail in
the headers.

Modification:
- Add an HTTP Specific ProxyConnectException
- Attach headers (if any) in the event of a non-200 response

Result:
Able to surface more useful error info to applications
