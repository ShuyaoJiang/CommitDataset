Take readerIndex into account when write to BIO.

Motivation:

We should take the readerIndex into account whe write into the BIO. Its currently not a problem as we slice before and so the readerIndex is always 0 but we should better not depend on this as this will break easily if we ever refactor the code and not slice anymore.

Modifications:

Take readerIndex into acount.

Result:

More safe and correct use.
