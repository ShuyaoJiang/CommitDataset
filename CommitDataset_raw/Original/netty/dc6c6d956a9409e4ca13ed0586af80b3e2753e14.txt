[#5541] Ensure failing a Promise in SimpleChannelPool will not result in stack overflow.

Motivation:

We used Promise.setFailure(...) when fail a Promise in SimpleChannelPool. As this happens in multiple levels this can result in stackoverflow as setFailure(...) may throw an IllegalStateException which then again is propergated.

Modifications:

Use tryFailure(...)

Result:

No more possibility to cause a stack overflow when failing the promise.
