Compress the heap dump after tests are finished

Motivation:

Tests sometimes time out because it took too long to compress the
generated heap dump.

Modifications:

- Move the compression logic to a new method 'compressHeapDumps()'
- Call TestUtils.compressHeapDumps() at the end of the tests, so that
  the tests do not fail because of timeout

Result:

JUnit reports the real cause of the test failure instead of timeout
exception.
