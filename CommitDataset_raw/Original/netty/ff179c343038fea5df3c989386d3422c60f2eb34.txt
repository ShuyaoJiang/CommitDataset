Reduce the time taken by NetUtil and DefaultChannelId class initialization

Motivation:

As reported in #2331, some query operations in NetworkInterface takes much longer time than we expected.  For example, specifying -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true option in Window increases the execution time by more than 4 times.  Some Windows systems have more than 20 network interfaces, and this problem gets bigger as the number of unused (virtual) NICs increases.

Modification:

Use NetworkInterface.getInetAddresses() wherever possible.
Before iterating over all NICs reported by NetworkInterface, filter the NICs without proper InetAddresses.  This reduces the number of candidates quite a lot.
NetUtil does not query hardware address of NIC in the first place but uses InetAddress.isLoopbackAddress().
Do not call unnecessary query operations on NetworkInterface.  Just get hardware address and compare.

Result:

Significantly reduced class initialization time, which should fix #2331.
