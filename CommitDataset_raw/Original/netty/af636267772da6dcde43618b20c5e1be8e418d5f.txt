Factor out less common code-path into own method to allow inlining. (#8590)


Motivation:

During benchmarks two methods showed up as "hot method too big". We can easily make these smaller by factor out some less common code-path to an extra method and so allow inlining.

Modifications:

Factor out less common code path to an extra method.

Result:

Hot methods can be inlined.
