Add awaitInactivity() to GlobalEventExecutor and ThreadDeathWatcher

Motivation:

When running Netty on a container environment, the container will often
complain about the lingering threads such as the worker threads of
ThreadDeathWatcher and GlobalEventExecutor.  We should provide an
operation that allows a use to wait until such threads are terminated.

Modifications:

- Add awaitInactivity()
- (misc) Fix typo in GlobalEventExecutorTest
- (misc) Port ThreadDeathWatch's CAS-based thread life cycle management
  to GlobalEventExecutor

Result:

- Fixes #2084
- Less overhead on task submission of GlobalEventExecutor
