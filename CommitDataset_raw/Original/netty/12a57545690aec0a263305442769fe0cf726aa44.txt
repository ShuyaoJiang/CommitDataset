Don't add null to SmtpResponse.details()

Motivation:

If the remote server returns an invalid response in the form "000 \r\n"
(i.e. a three digit code, then space, but no details), null is added
as a singletonList to the response being constructed.

This seems unexpected and it would be easier to handle an empty
details list in client code.

Modifications:

If detail is null (because frame.isReadable() returned false after
reading the separator), initialise DefaultSmtpResponse with an empty
list instead of a list containing a single null value.

Result:

When encountering this malformed server response, a DefaultSmtpResponse
with a code but no details will be created.
