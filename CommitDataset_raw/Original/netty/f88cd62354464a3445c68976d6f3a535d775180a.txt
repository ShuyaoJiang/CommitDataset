[#2692] Allows notify ChannelFutureProgressListener on complete writes

Motivation:

We have some inconsistency when handling writes. Sometimes we call ChannelOutboundBuffer.progress(...) also for complete writes and sometimes not. We should call it always.

Modifications:

Correctly call ChannelOuboundBuffer.progress(...) for complete and incomplete writes.

Result:

Consistent behavior
