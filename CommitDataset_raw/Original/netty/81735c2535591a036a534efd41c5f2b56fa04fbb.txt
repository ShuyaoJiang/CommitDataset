Check if Epoll is avaible when construct EpollEventLoopGroup

Motivation:

We should call Epoll.ensureAvailability() when init EpollEventLoopGroup to fail fast and with a proper exception.

Modifications:

Call Epoll.ensureAvailability() during EpollEventLoopGroup init.

Result:

Fail fast if epoll is not availability (for whatever reason).
