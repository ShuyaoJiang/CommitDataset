Support IPv4 default route in ipfilter.

Motivation:

In GitHub issue #2767 a bug was reported that the IPv4
default route leads to the ipfilter package denying
instead of accepting all addresses.

While the issue was reported for Netty 3.9, this bug
also applies to Netty 4 and higher.

Modifications:

When computing the subnet address from the CIDR prefix,
correctly handle the case where the prefix is set to zero.

Result:

Ipfilter accepts all addresses when passed the
IPv4 default route.
