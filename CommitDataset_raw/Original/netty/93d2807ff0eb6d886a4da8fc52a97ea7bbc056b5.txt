Auto-detect Log4J2 for logging if on the class-path (#8109)

Motivation:

https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/5047 added Log4J2 support but missed to add code to try to auto-detect it.

Modifications:

Try to use Log4JLoggerFactory by default.

Result:

Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/8107.
