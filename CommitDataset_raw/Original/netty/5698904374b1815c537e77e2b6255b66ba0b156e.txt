Fixed issue: NETTY-180 Channel.getRemoteAddress() can return null for a received MessageEvent when ExecutionHandler is in the pipeline.
* All Channel implementations but DatagramChannel now cache localAddress and remoteAddress so that they do not return null even after the connection has been closed.
