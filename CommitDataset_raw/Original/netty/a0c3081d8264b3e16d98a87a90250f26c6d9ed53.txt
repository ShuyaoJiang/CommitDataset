Reduce http2 buffer slicing (#8598)

Motivation

DefaultHttp2FrameReader currently does a fair amount of "intermediate"
slicing which can be avoided.

Modifications

Avoid slicing the input buffer in DefaultHttp2FrameReader until
necessary. In one instance this also means retainedSlice can be used
instead (which may also avoid allocating).

Results

Less allocations when using http2.
