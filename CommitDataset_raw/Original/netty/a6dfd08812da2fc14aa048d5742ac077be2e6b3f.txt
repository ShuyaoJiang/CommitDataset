Mark initialization of selector as privileged

Motivation:

Instrumenting the NIO selector implementation requires special
permissions. Yet, the code for performing this instrumentation is
executed in a manner that would require all code leading up to the
initialization to have the requisite permissions. In a restrictive
environment (e.g., under a security policy that only grants the
requisite permissions the Netty transport jar but not to application
code triggering the Netty initialization), then instrumeting the
selector will not succeed even if the security policy would otherwise
permit it.

Modifications:

This commit marks the necessary blocks as privileged. This enables
access to the necessary resources for instrumenting the selector. The
idea is that we are saying the Netty code is trusted, and as long as the
Netty code has been granted the necessary permissions, then we will
allow the caller access to these resources even though the caller itself
might not have the requisite permissions.

Result:

The selector can be instrumented in a restrictive security environment.
