http2: Http2StreamChannel now shares options of its parent channel

Motivation

Http2StreamChannel ignores options of its parent channel when being created. That leads to surprising results when, for example, unpooled allocator could be silently replaced with pooled allocator (default setting).

Modification

Copy parent channel's options over to the Http2StreamChannel.

Result

Channel options are now consistent between Http2StreamChannel and its parent channel. Newly added test passes on this branch and fails on master. Fixes #6551.
