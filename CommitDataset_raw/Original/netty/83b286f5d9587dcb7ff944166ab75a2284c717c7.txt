Set result for decoded request and add test for #8721 (#8721)


Motivation:
I want to fix bug in vert.x project (eclipse-vertx/vert.x#2562) caused by ComposedLastHttpContent result being null. I don't know if it is intentional that this last decoded chuck in the issue returns null, but if not - I am providing fix for that.

Modification:
* Added new constructor in ComposedLastHttpContent allowing to pass DecoderResult
* set DecoderResult.SUCCESS for created ComposedLastHttpContent in HttpContentEncoder
* set DecoderResult.SUCCESS for created ComposedLastHttpContent in HttpContentDecoder

Result:
Fixes eclipse-vertx/vert.x#2562
