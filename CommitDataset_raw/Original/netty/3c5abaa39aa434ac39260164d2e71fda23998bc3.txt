Correctly handle non handshake commands when using SniHandler

Motivation:

As we can only handle handshake commands to parse SNI we should try to skip alert and change cipher spec commands a few times before we fallback to use a default SslContext.

Modifications:

- Use default SslContext if no application data command was received
- Use default SslContext if after 4 commands we not received a handshake command
- Simplify code
- Eliminate multiple volatile fields
- Rename SslConstants to SslUtils
- Share code between SslHandler and SniHandler by moving stuff to SslUtils

Result:

Correct handling of non handshake commands and cleaner code.
