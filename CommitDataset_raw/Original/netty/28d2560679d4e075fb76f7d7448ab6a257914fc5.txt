Update SSLEngineTest certificate validity

Motivation:
A bunch of unit tests are failing due to certificates having expired.
This has to be replaced with a newly generated certificate that has a
longer validity.

Modifications:
- generated a certificate with validity of 100 years from now

Results:
Unit tests are passing again
