PlatformDependent0 should enforce array index scale for byte[] explicitly

Motivation:
PlatformDependent0 makes assumptions that the array index scale for byte[] is always 1. If this is not the case the results from methods which make this assumption will be undefined.

Modifications:
- PlatformDependent0 should check if unsafe.arrayIndexScale(byte[].class) is not 1, and if so not use unsafe

Result:
Assumptions made by optimizations in PlatformDependent0 which use byte[] are explicitly enforced.
