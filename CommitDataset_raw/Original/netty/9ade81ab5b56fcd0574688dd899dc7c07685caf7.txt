Use system property to detect if root is running the program

Motivation:

We forked a new process to detect if the program is run by root. We should better just use user.name system property

Modifications:

- Change PlatformDependent.isRoot0() to read the user.name system property to detect if root runs the program and rename it to maybeSuperUser0().
- Rename PlatformDependent.isRoot() to maybeSuperUser() and let it init directly in the static block

Result:

Less heavy way to detect if the program is run by root.
