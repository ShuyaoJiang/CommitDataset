[#5507] SingleThreadEventExecutor should reject call invoke*() from within the EventLoop.

Motivation:

ExecutorService.invoke*(...) methods may block by API definition. This can lead to deadlocks if called from inside the EventLoop in SingleThreadEventExecutor as it only has one Thread that does all the work.

Modifications:

Throw a RejectedExectionException if someone tries to call SingleThreadEventExecutor.invoke*(...) while in the EventLoop.

Result:

No more deadlock possible.
