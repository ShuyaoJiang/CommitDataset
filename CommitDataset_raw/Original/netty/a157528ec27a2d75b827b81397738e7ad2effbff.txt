Ensure we only add OpenSslEngine to the OpenSslEngineMap when handshake is started

Motivation:

We need to ensure we only add the OpenSslEngine to the OpenSslEngineMap when the handshake is started as otherwise we may produce a memory leak when the OpenSslEngine is created but not actually used. This can for example happen if we encounter a connection refused from the remote peer. In this case we will never remove the OpenSslEngine from the OpenSslEngineMap and so it will never be collected (as we hold a reference). This has as affect that the finalizer will never be run as well.

Modifications:

- Lazy add the OpenSslEngine to the OpenSslEngineMap to elimate possible leak.
- Call OpenSslEngine.shutdown() when SslHandler is removed from the ChannelPipeline to free memory asap in all cases.

Result:

No more memory leak with OpenSslEngine if connection is refused.
