Rewrite misleading Note in FingerprintTrustManagerFactory javadoc

Motivation:

The current note reads as if this class is dangerous and advises the reader to "understand what this class does".

Modifications:

Rewrite the Javadoc note to describe what fingerprint checks are and what problems remain.

Result:

Clearer description which no longer causes the impression this class is dangerous.
