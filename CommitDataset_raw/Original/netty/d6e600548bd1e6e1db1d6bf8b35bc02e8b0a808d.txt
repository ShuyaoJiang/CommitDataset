HTTP/2 Remove Http2FrameStream#CONNECTION_STREAM

Motivation:
Http2FrameStream#CONNECTION_STREAM is required to identify the
connection stream. However this leads to inconsistent usage from a user
perspective. When a user creates a Http2Frame for a non-connection
stream, the Http2MultiplexCodec automatically sets the stream, and the
user is never exposed to the Http2FrameStream object. However when the
user writes a Http2Frame for a connection stream they are required to
set the Http2FrameStream object. We can remove the Http2FrameStream#CONNECTION_STREAM
and keep the Http2FrameStream object internal, and therefore consistent
between the connection and non-connection use cases.

Modifications:
- Remove Http2FrameStream#CONNECTION_STREAM
- Update Http2FrameCodec to handle Http2Frame#stream() which returns
null

Result:
More consistent usage on http2 parent channel and http2 child channel.
