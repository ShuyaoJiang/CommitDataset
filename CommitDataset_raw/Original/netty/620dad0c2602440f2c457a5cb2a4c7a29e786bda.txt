Allow to validate sni hostname with underscore (#8150)

Motivation:

We should allow to also validate sni hostname which contains for example underscore when using our native SSL impl. The JDK implementation does this as well.

Modifications:

- Construct the SNIHostName via byte[] and not String.
- Add unit test

Result:

Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/8144.
