AbstractMethodError with barchart-udt

Motivation:

`SocketChannelUDT` from barchart-udt does not have the java 7 `public abstract SocketChannel bind(SocketAddress local)` method. Calling the abstract method `SocketChannel.bind(SocketAddress localAddress)` for `SocketChannelUDT` leads to an `AbstractMethodError` runtime error.

Modifications:

Make workaround with explicit call of `SocketChannelUDT.bind(SocketAddress local)` as it done in `NioUdtByteConnectorChannel`.

Result:

Fixes [#6934].
