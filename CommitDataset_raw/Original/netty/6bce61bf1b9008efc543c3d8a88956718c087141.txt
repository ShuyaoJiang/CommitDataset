[#2234] Use QueryStringDecoder.decodeComponent to decode url-encoded data instead of Java's URLDecoder.

Motivation:
Previously, we used URLDecoder.decode(...) to decode url-encoded data. This generates a lot of garbage and takes a considerable amount of time.

Modifications:
Replace URLDecoder.decode(...) with QueryStringDecoder.decodeComponent(...)

Result:
Less garbage to GC and faster decode processing.
