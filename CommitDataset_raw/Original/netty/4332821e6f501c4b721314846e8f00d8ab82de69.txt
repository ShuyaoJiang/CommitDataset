Use common non-magic number for shutdown timeout

Motivation:

AbstractEventExecutor and AbstractEventExecutorGroup have hard-coded magic timeout numbers.  They should have the same timeout numbers, but it's easy to break that rule because they are hard-coded in each place.

Modifications:

Add package private constants to AbstractEventExecutor and let AbstractEventExecutorGroup use them.

Result:

Single timeout change affects two classes.
