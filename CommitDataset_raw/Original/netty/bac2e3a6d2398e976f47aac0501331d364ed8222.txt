Reduce calls to System.nanoTime() and object creation in IdleStateHandler. Related to [#3808]

Motivation:

Calling System.nanoTime() for each channelRead(...) is very expensive. See [#3808] for more detailed description.
Also we always do extra work for each write and read even if read or write idle states should not be handled.

Modifications:

- Move System.nanoTime() call to channelReadComplete(...).
- Reuse ChannelFutureListener for writes
- Only add ChannelFutureListener to writes if write and all idle states should be handled.
- Only call System.nanoTime() for reads if idle state events for read and all states should be handled.

Result:

Less overhead when using the IdleStateHandler.
