Change hosts file resolver to be case-insensitive

Motivation:

Resolving hosts via the /etc/hosts file should be case-insensitive, e.g. localhost and LOCALHOST refer to the same host, this is the same that is applied to dns queries.

Modifications:

Store hosts Map with lowercase keys, lookup the keys as lowercase
Add to unit test for the hosts file parser to use an UPPERCASE file entry
Add unit test for DefaultHostsFileEntriesResolver to resolve both localhost and LOCALHOST

Result:

host resolution for local hosts file should match the rules applied to "getent hosts" or "ping"
