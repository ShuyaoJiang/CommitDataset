Support empty http responses when using compression

Motivation:

Found a bug in that netty would generate a 20 byte body when returing a response
to an HTTP HEAD. the 20 bytes seems to be related to the compression footer.

RFC2616, section 9.4 states that responses to an HTTP HEAD MUST not return a message
body in the response.

Netty's own client implementation expected an empty response. The extra bytes lead to a
2nd response with an error decoder result:
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: invalid version format: 14

Modifications:

Track the HTTP request method. When processing the response we determine if the response
is passthru unnchanged. This decision now takes into account the request method and passthru
responses related to HTTP HEAD requests.

Result:

Netty's http client works and better RFC conformance.
