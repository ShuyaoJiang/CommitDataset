Remove call to SSL.setHostNameValidation(...) as it is done in the TrustManager (#8981)

Motivation:

We do not need to call SSL.setHostNameValidation(...) as it should be done as part of the TrustManager implementation. This is consistent with the JDK implementation of SSLEngine.

Modifications:

Remove call to SSL.setHostNameValidation(...)

Result:

More consistent behaviour between our SSLEngine implementation and the one that comes with the JDK.
