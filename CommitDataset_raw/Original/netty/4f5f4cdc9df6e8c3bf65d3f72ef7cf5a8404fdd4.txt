[#2262] Fix NPE triggered by unresolveable InetSocketAddress in epoll transport

Motivation:
At the moment when an unresolvable InetSocketAddress is passed into the epoll transport a NPE is thrown

Modifications:
Add check in place which will throw an UnknownHostException if an InetSocketAddress could not been resolved.

Result:
Proper handling of unresolvable InetSocketAddresses
