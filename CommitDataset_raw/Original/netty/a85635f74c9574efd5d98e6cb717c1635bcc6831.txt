* Added HttpVersion.isKeepAliveDefault() to handle the 'Connection' header in a more robust manner
* Added HttpVersion constructors with the default keep alive flag - old constructors were deprecated due to ambiguity
* Moved HttpMessage.is/setKeepAlive() to HttpHeaders and deprecated the original method
