[#3848] Respect EPOLLERR event

Motivation:

Some glibc/kernel versions will trigger an EPOLLERR event to notify
about failed connect and not an EPOLLOUT. Also EPOLLERR may be triggered
when a connection is broke.

Modification:

React on EPOLLERR like if an EPOLLOUT / EPOLLIN was received, this will work in
all cases as we handle errors in EPOLLOUT / EPOLLIN anyway.

Result:

Correctly detect errors.
