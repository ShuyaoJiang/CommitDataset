Optimize AbstractByteBuf.getCharSequence() in US_ASCII case (#8392)

* Optimize AbstractByteBuf.getCharSequence() in US_ASCII case

Motivation:

Inspired by https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8388, I noticed this
simple optimization to avoid char[] allocation (also suggested in a TODO
here).

Modifications:

Return an AsciiString from AbstractByteBuf.getCharSequence() if
requested charset is US_ASCII or ISO_8859_1 (latter thanks to
@Scottmitch's suggestion). Also tweak unit tests not to require Strings
and include a new benchmark to demonstrate the speedup.

Result:

Speed-up of AbstractByteBuf.getCharSequence() in ascii and iso 8859/1
cases
