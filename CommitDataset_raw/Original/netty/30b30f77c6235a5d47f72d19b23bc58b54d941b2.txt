Support SSLSession.getLocalCertificates() and getLocalPrincipal() when using OpenSSL

Motivation:

SSLSession.getLocalCertificates() and getLocalPrincipal() was not supported when using OpenSSL, which can produce problems when switch from JDK to OpenSSL impl.

Modifications:

Implement SSLSession.getLocalCertificates() and getLocalPrincipal() for OpenSslEngine.

Result:

More consistent behaving between JDK and OpenSSL based SSLEngine.
