HTTP/2: Fix some errors reported by h2spec.

Motivation:

h2spec [1] reported 32 issues [2] with Netty's HTTP/2 implementation.

Modifications:

Fixed 11 of those issues. Mostly wrong error codes or added missing validation
code in the frame reader.

Result:

11 fewer errors. h2spec now reports: 70 tests, 48 passed, 1 skipped, 21 failed
