Introduce a new ChannelOption called DATAGRAM_CHANNEL_ACTIVE_ON_REGISTRATION. Related to [#1830]

This ChannelOption allows to tell the DatagramChannel implementation to be active as soon as they are registrated to their EventLoop. This can be used to make it possible to write to a not bound DatagramChannel.
The ChannelOption is marked as @deprecated as I'm looking for a better solution in master which breaks default behaviour with 4.0 branch.
