Remove unnecessary loop and indentation in decompressors

Motivation:

Decompression handlers contain heavy use of switch-case statements. We
use compact indentation style for 'case' so that we utilize our screen
real-estate more efficiently.

Also, the following decompression handlers do not need to run a loop,
because ByteToMessageDecoder already runs a loop for them:

- FastLzFrameDecoder
- Lz4FrameDecoder
- LzfDecoder

Modifications:

- Fix indentations
- Do not wrap the decoding logic with a for loop when unnecessary
- Handle the case where a FastLz/Lzf frame contains no data properly so
  that the buffer does not leak and less garbage is produced.

Result:

- Efficiency
- Compact source code
- No buffer leak
