Opportunity for lazy initialization in Headers interface

Motivation:
The Headers interface had two member variables (addAllVisitor, setAllVisitor) which are not necessarily always needed but are always instantiated.  This may result in excess memory being used.

Modifications:
 - addAllVisitor will be accessed via a method addAllVisitor() which will use lazy initialization.
 - setAllVisitor will be accessed via a method addAllVisitor() which will use lazy initialization.

Result:
Potential memory savings by using lazy initialization.
