Exclude native transport related test and dependency when not running under Linux, close #4409

Motivation:

The build fails on OSX, due to it trying to pull in an epoll specific OSX dependency. See #4409.

Modifications:

* move netty-transport-native-epoll to linux profile
* exclude Http2FrameWriterBenchmark from compiler
* include Http2FrameWriterBenchmark back only in linux profile (please check)

Result:

Build succeeds on OSX.
