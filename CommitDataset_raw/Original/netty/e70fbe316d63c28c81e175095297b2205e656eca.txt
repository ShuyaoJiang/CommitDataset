Fire exceptionCaught before exception-caused close for WebSockets.

Motivation:

WebSocket decoding throws exceptions on failure that should cause the
pipline to close.  These are currently ignored in the
`WebSocketProtocolHandler` and `WebSocketServerProtocolHandler`.  In
particular, this means that messages exceding the max message size will
cause the channel to close with no reported failure.

Modifications:

Re-fire the event just before closing the socket to allow it to be
handled appropriately.

Result:

Closes [#3063].
