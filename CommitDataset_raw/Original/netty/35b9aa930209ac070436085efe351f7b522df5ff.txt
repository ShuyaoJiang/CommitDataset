Replace LinkedHashSet by ArrayList to avoid iterators.

Motivation:

In a simple load test that creates and closes several 10k streams per second
I have seen Iterator objects using roughly 1.6% of the total committed heap.

Modifications:

Use an ArrayList instead of a LinkedHashSet to store the connection listeners.
That way we can iterate over the list without creating an iterator every time.

Result:

Zero Iterator allocations due to notifying connection listeners.
