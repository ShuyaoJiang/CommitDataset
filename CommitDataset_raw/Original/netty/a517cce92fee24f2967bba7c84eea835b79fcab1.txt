Do not send duplicate DNS queries when the same query is in progress already

Related issue: #5179

Motivation:

When you attempt to make a lot of connection attempts to the same target
host at the same time and our DNS resolver does not have a record for it
in the cache, the DNS resolver will send as many DNS queries as the
number of connection attempts.

As a result, DNS server will reject or drop the requests, making the
name resolution attempt fail.

Modifications:

- Add InflightNameResolver that keeps the list of name resolution
  queries and subscribes to the future of the matching query instead of
  sending a duplicate query.

Result:

- The AddressResolvers created by DnsAddressResolverGroup do not send
  duplicate DNS queries anymore
