Skip SSLEngineTests that depend on KeyManagerFactory when this is not supported by the openssl version.

Motivation:

Some version of openssl dont support the needed APIs to use a KeyManagerFactory. In this case we should skip the tests.

Modifications:

- Use assumeTrue(...) to skip tests that need a KeyManagerFactory and its not supported.

Result:

Tests pass on all openssl versions we support.
