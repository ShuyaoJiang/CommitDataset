[#2414] Fix RuntimeException during modify events via EpollEventLoop

Motivation:
We are currently try to modify the events via EpollEventLoop even when the channel was closed before and so the fd was set to -1. This fails with a RuntimeException in this case.

Modification:
Always check if the Channel is still open before try to modify the events.

Result:
No more RuntimeException because of a not open channel
