Refactor FastThreadLocal to simplify TLV management

Motivation:

When Netty runs in a managed environment such as web application server,
Netty needs to provide an explicit way to remove the thread-local
variables it created to prevent class loader leaks.

FastThreadLocal uses different execution paths for storing a
thread-local variable depending on the type of the current thread.
It increases the complexity of thread-local removal.

Modifications:

- Moved FastThreadLocal and FastThreadLocalThread out of the internal
  package so that a user can use it.
- FastThreadLocal now keeps track of all thread local variables it has
  initialized, and calling FastThreadLocal.removeAll() will remove all
  thread-local variables of the caller thread.
- Added FastThreadLocal.size() for diagnostics and tests
- Introduce InternalThreadLocalMap which is a mixture of hard-wired
  thread local variable fields and extensible indexed variables
- FastThreadLocal now uses InternalThreadLocalMap to implement a
  thread-local variable.
- Added ThreadDeathWatcher.unwatch() so that PooledByteBufAllocator
  tells it to stop watching when its thread-local cache has been freed
  by FastThreadLocal.removeAll().
- Added FastThreadLocalTest to ensure that removeAll() works
- Added microbenchmark for FastThreadLocal and JDK ThreadLocal
- Upgraded to JMH 0.9

Result:

- A user can remove all thread-local variables Netty created, as long as
  he or she did not exit from the current thread. (Note that there's no
  way to remove a thread-local variable from outside of the thread.)
- FastThreadLocal exposes more useful operations such as isSet() because
  we always implement a thread local variable via InternalThreadLocalMap
  instead of falling back to JDK ThreadLocal.
- FastThreadLocalBenchmark shows that this change improves the
  performance of FastThreadLocal even more.
