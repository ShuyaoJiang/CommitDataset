Decouple DnsCache and DnsCacheEntry

Motivation:
DnsCache (an interface) is coupled to DnsCacheEntry (a final class). This means that DnsCache implementations can't implement their own DnsCacheEntry objects if the default behavior isn't appropriate.

Modifications:
- DnsCacheEntry should be moved to DefaultDnsCache as it is an implementation detail
- DnsCache#cache(..) should return a new DnsCacheEntry
- The methods which from DnsCacheEntry that were used outside the scope of DefaultDnsCache should be moved into an interface

Result:
DnsCache is more extensible and not tightly coupled to a default implementation of DnsCacheEntry.
