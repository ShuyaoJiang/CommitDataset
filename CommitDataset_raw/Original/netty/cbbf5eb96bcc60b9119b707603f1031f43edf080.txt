Compress the heap dump generated by TestUtils.dump()

Motivation:

It takes too long to download the heap dump from the CI server.

Modifications:

Compress the heap dump as much as possible.

Result:

When heap dump is generated by certain test failure, the generated heap
dump file is about 3 times smaller than before, although the compression
time will increase the build time when the test fails.
