Fix broken constructor chaining for FixedChannelPool class.

Motivation:

Only one of the three FixedChannelPool constructors checks for the constructor
arguments. Therfore it was possible to create a pool with zero maxConnections.

This change chains all constructors together, so that the last one
in the chain always checks the validity of the arguments, regardless of the
constructor used.

Result:

It is no longer possible to create a FixedChannelPool instance with invalid
maxConnections or maxPendingAcquires parameters.
