netty_unix_socket free nettyClassName after using it

Motivation:
netty_unix_socket attempts to use nettyClassName in an error message, but previously freed the memory. We should wait to free the memory until after we use it.

Modifications:
- Free nettyClassName after using it in snprintf

Result:
More useful error message.
