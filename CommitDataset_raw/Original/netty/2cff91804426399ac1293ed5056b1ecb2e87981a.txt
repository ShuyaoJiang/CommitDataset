Correct usages of internalNioBuffer

Motivation:
There are numerous usages of internalNioBuffer which hard code 0 for the index when the intention was to use the readerIndex().

Modifications:
- Remove hard coded 0 for the index and use readerIndex()

Result:
We are less susceptible to using the wrong index, and don't make assumptions about the ByteBufAllocator.
