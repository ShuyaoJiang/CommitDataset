Allow to configure socket option SO_BUSY_POLL (#8268)

Motivation:

When using Epoll based transport, allow applications to configure SO_BUSY_POLL socket option:

       SO_BUSY_POLL (since Linux 3.11)
              Sets the approximate time in microseconds to busy poll on a
              blocking receive when there is no data.  Increasing this value
              requires CAP_NET_ADMIN.  The default for this option is con‐
              trolled by the /proc/sys/net/core/busy_read file.

              The value in the /proc/sys/net/core/busy_poll file determines
              how long select(2) and poll(2) will busy poll when they oper‐
              ate on sockets with SO_BUSY_POLL set and no events to report
              are found.

              In both cases, busy polling will only be done when the socket
              last received data from a network device that supports this
              option.

              While busy polling may improve latency of some applications,
              care must be taken when using it since this will increase both
              CPU utilization and power usage.

Modification:

Added SO_BUSY_POLL socket option
Result:

Able to configure SO_BUSY_POLL from Netty
