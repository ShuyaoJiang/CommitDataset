Let OpenSslEngine.wrap(...) / OpenSslEngine.unwrap(...) behave like stated in the javadocs.

Motivation:

OpenSslEngine.wrap(...) and OpenSslEngie.unwrap(...) may consume bytes even if an BUFFER_OVERFLOW / BUFFER_UNDERFLOW is detected. This is not correct as it should only consume bytes if it can process them without storing data between unwrap(...) / wrap(...) calls. Beside this it also should only process one record at a time.

Modifications:

- Correctly detect BUFFER_OVERFLOW / BUFFER_UNDERFLOW and only consume bytes if non of them is detected.
- Only process one record per call.

Result:

OpenSslEngine behaves like stated in the javadocs of SSLEngine.
