[#5088] Add annotation which marks packages/interfaces/classes as unstable

Motivation:

Some codecs should be considered unstable as these are relative new. For this purpose we should introduce an annotation which these codecs should us to be marked as unstable in terms of API.

Modifications:

- Add UnstableApi annotation and use it on codecs that are not stable
- Move http2.hpack to http2.internal.hpack as it is internal.

Result:

Better document unstable APIs.
