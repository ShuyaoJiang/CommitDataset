Use separate query ID space for different DNS servers

Related: #3972

Motivation:

DnsNameResolver limits the number of concurrent in-progress DNS queries
to 65536 regardless the number of DNS servers it communicates with. When
the number of available DNS servers are more than just one, we end up
using much less (65536 / numDnsServers) query IDs per DNS server, which
is non-optimal.

Modifications:

- Replace the query ID and context management with
  DnsQueryContextManager
  - Eash DNS server gets its own query ID space

Result:

Much bigger query ID space, and thus there's less chance of getting the
'query ID space exhaustion' error
