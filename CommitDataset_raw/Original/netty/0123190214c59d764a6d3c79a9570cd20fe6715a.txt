Netty BOM inherit from parent and its own dependency management

Motivation:

A BOM should only expose dependency management for the artifacts that the project produces (so in this case, netty artifacts). It should not have an opinion about third party dependencies (otherwise including that BOM in a project potentially overrides decisions that were made about them).

Modifications:

Stop inheriting from netty-parent and explicitly set the versions for the artifacts.

Result:

Valid BOM.
