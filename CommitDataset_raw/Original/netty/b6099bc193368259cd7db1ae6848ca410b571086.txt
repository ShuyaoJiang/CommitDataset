Fix unbalanced quotes in Bundle-NativeCode manifest header

Motivation:

The previously generated manifest causes a parse exception when loaded into an Apache Felix OSGI container.

Modifications:

Fix parameter delimiter and unbalanced quotes in manifest entry. Suffixed with asterisk so the bundle is resolved on other architectures as well even if native libs won't be loaded.

Result:

Bundle will load properly in OSGI containers.
