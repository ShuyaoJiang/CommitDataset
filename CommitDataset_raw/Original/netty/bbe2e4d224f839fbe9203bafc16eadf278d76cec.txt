We should try to load netty-tcnative before using it in OpenSslCertificateException. (#8202)

Motivation:

In OpenSslCertificateException we should ensure we try to load netty-tcnative before trying to use any class from it as otherwise it may throw an error due missing linking of the native libs.

Modifications:

- Ensure we call OpenSsl.isAvailable() before we try to use netty-tcnative for validation
- Add testcase.

Result:

No more errors causing by not loading native libs before trying to use these.
