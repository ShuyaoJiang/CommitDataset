Zero length data frames should apply flow control.

Motivation:
A downstream consumer of Netty failed as emitting zero-length http2 data frames in a unit test resulted in assertion errors in Http2LocalFlowController. Since zero-length frames are valid, an assertion that http2 data frame length must be positive is invalid.

Modifications:

Assertions of data length in Http2LocalFlowController now permit zero.

Result:

Those running netty with assertions on can now emit zero length http2 data frames.
