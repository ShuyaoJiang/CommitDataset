Remove WeakOrderedQueue from WeakHashMap when FastThreadLocal value was removed if possible.

Motivation:

We should remove the WeakOrderedQueue from the WeakHashMap directly if possible and only depend on the semantics of the WeakHashMap if there is no other way for us to cleanup it.

Modifications:

Override onRemoval(...) to remove the WeakOrderedQueue if possible.

Result:

Less overhead and quicker collection of WeakOrderedQueue for some cases.
