Use ResourceLeakDetectorFactory in HashedWheelTimer

Motivation:

We recently added the ResourceLeakDetectorFactory but missed to updated HashedWheelTimer to use it.

Modifications:

- Add new abstract method to ResourceLeakDetectorFactory that allows to provide also samplingInterval and maxActive args.
- Deprecate most constructors in ResourceLeakDetector and add doc explaining that people should use ResourceLeakDetectorFactory

Result:

Custom ResourceLeakDetectorFactory will also be used in HashedWheelTimer if configured.
