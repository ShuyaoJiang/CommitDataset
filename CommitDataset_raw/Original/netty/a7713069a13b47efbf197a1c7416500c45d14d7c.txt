HttpObjectDecoder performance improvements

Motivation:
The HttpObjectDecoder is on the hot code path for the http codec. There are a few hot methods which can be modified to improve performance.

Modifications:
- Modify AppendableCharSequence to provide unsafe methods which don't need to re-check bounds for every call.
- Update HttpObjectDecoder methods to take advantage of new AppendableCharSequence methods.

Result:
Peformance boost for decoding http objects.
