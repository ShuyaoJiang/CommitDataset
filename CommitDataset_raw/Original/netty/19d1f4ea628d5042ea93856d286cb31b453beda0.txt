Propagate pong frames in WebSocketProtocolHandler (#7955)

Motivation:

Currently, on recipt of a PongWebSocketFrame, the
WebSocketProtocolHandler will drop the frame, rather than passing it
along so it can be referenced by other handlers.

Modifications:

Add boolean field to WebSocketProtocolHandler to indicate whether Pong
frames should be dropped or propagated, defaulting to "true" to preserve
existing functionality.

Add new constructors to the client and server implementations of
WebSocketProtocolHandler that allow for overriding the behavior for the
handling of Pong frames.

Result:

PongWebSocketFrames are passed along the channel, if specified.
