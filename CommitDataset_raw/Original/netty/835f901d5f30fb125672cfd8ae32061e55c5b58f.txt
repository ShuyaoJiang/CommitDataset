Fix #5590 QueryStringDecoder#path should decode the path info

Motivation:

Currently, QueryStringDecoder#path simply returns the path info as is, without decoding it as the Javadoc states.

Modifications:

* Make QueryStringDecoder#path decode the path info.
* Add tests to QueryStringDecoderTest.

Result:

QueryStringDecoder#path now decodes the path info as expected.
