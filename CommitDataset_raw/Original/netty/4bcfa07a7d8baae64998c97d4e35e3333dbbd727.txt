Fix OpenSslCertificateException error code validation

Motivation:

In OpenSslCertificateException we tried to validate the supplied error code but did not correctly account for all different valid error codes and so threw an IllegalArgumentException.

Modifications:

- Fix validation by updating to latest netty-tcnative and use CertificateVerifier.isValid
- Add unit tests

Result:

Validation of error code works as expected.
