DnsNameResolver: makes possible to define additional records in DNS query

Motivation:

Current DnsNameResolver api don't allow to define additional records in DNS query.
It can be useful in many cases. For example when we want to query dns server with
real client address (EDNS-CLIENT-SUBNET extension:
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-vandergaast-edns-client-subnet-02 )

Modifications:

This change add new query methods with list of additional DnsRecord-s for query.

Result:

It is possible to create dns query with EDNS-CLIENT-SUBNET extension for example.
