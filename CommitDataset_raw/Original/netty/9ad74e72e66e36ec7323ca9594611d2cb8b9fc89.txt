Remove content-length header leniency

Motivation:

If the content-length does not parse as a number, leniency causes this
to instead be parsed as the default value. This leads to bodies being
silently ignored on requests which can be incredibly dangerous. Instead,
if the content-length header is invalid, an exception should be thrown
for upstream handling.

Modifications:

This commit removes the leniency in parsing the content-length header by
allowing a number format exception, if thrown, to escape from the method
rather than falling back to the default value.

Result:

In invalid content-length header will not be silently ignored.
