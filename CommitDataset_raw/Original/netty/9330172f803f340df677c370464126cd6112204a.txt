Introduce a native transport for linux using epoll ET

This transport use JNI (C) to directly make use of epoll in Edge-Triggered mode for maximal performance on Linux. Beside this it also support using TCP_CORK and produce less GC then the NIO transport using JDK NIO.
It only builds on linux and skip the build if linux is not used. The transport produce a jar which contains all needed .so files for 32bit and 64 bit. The user only need to include the jar as dependency as usually
to make use of it and use the correct classes.

This includes also some cleanup of @trustin
