Correctly record creation stacktrace in ResourceLeakDetector.

Motivation:

We missed to correctly record the stacktrace of the creation of an ResourceLeak record. This could either have the effect to log the wrote stacktrace for creation or not log a stacktrace at all if the object was dropped on the floor after it was created.

Modifications:

Correctly create a Record on creation of the object.

Result:

Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/7781.
