fix failure logging of value on channel option set

Motivation:

The code accidentally passes channel twice instead of value, resulting in logs like:
Failed to set channel option 'SO_SNDBUF' with value '[id: 0x2c5b2eb4]' for channel '[id: 0x2c5b2eb4]'

Modifications:

Pass value instead of channel where it needs to be.

Result:

Failed to set channel option 'SO_SNDBUF' with value '0' for channel '[id: 0x9bd3c5b8]'
