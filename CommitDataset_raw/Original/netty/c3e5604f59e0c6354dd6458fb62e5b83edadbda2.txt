Do not throw IndexOutOfBoundsException on an invalid SSL record

Motivation:

When an SSL record contains an invalid extension data, SniHandler
currently throws an IndexOutOfBoundsException, which is not optimal.

Modifications:

- Do strict index range checks

Result:

No more unnecessary instantiation of exceptions and their stack traces
