Headers Performance Boost and Interface Simplification

Motivation:
A degradation in performance has been observed from the 4.0 branch as documented in https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/3962.

Modifications:
- Simplify Headers class hierarchy.
- Restore the DefaultHeaders to be based upon DefaultHttpHeaders from 4.0.
- Make various other modifications that are causing hot spots.

Result:
Performance is now on par with 4.0.
