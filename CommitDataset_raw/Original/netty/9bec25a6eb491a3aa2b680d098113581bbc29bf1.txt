Set the Transfer-Encoding header instead of adding

Motivation:

HttpUtil.setTransferEncodingChunked could add a second Transfer-Encoding
header if one was already present. While this is technically valid, it
does not appear to be the intent of the method.

Result:

Only one Transfer-Encoding header is present after calling this method.
