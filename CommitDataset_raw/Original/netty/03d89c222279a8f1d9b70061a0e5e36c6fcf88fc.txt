Use Constructor for reflective class instantiation.

Motivation:
Calling `newInstance()` on a Class object can bypass compile time
checked Exception propagation.  This is noted in Java Puzzlers,
as well as in ErrorProne:

Modifications:
Use the niladic constructor to create a new instance.

Result:
Compile time safety for checked exceptions
