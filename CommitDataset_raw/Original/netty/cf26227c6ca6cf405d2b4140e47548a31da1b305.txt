Supply a builder for Http2Codec

Motivation:

DefaultHttp2FrameWriter has constructors that it would be a hassle to
expose as configuration parameters on Http2Codec. We should instead
make a builder for Http2Codec.

Modifications:

Get rid of the public constructors on Http2Codec and instead make sure
you can always use the builder where you would have used the constructor
before.

Result:

Http2Codec can be configured more flexibly, and the SensitivityDetector
can be configured.
