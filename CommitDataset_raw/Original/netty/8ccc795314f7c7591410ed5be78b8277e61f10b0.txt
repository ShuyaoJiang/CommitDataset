Expose DefaultThreadFactory.threadGroup to sub-classes

Motivation:

DefaultThreadFactory allows to override the newThread(...) method and so should have access to all fields that are set via the constructor.

Modifications:

Change threadGroup from private to protected visibility.

Result:

Easier to extend DefaultThreadFactory.
