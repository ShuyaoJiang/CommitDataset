Implement flush-future properly / Make channel options type-safe

- AbstractChannel keeps the expected number of written bytes so that
  the ChannelFuture of a flush() operation is notified on right timing.
  - Added ChannelBufferHolder.size() to make this possible
- Added AbstractChannel.isCompatible() so that only compatible EventLoop
  is accepted by a channel on registration
- Added ChannelOption to make channel options type-safe
- Moved writeSpinCount property to ChannelConfig and removed Nio*Config
- Miscellaneous cleanup

introducing
ChannelOption
