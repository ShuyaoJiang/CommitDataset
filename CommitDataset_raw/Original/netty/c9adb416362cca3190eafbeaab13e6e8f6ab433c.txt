Refactor tests for compression codecs

Motivation:

Too many duplicated code of tests for different compression codecs.

Modifications:

- Added abstract classes AbstractCompressionTest, AbstractDecoderTest and AbstractEncoderTest which contains common variables and tests for any compression codec.
- Removed common tests which are implemented in AbstractDecoderTest and AbstractEncoderTest from current tests for compression codecs.
- Implemented abstract methods of AbstractDecoderTest and AbstractEncoderTest in current tests for compression codecs.
- Added additional checks for current tests.
- Renamed abstract class IntegrationTest to AbstractIntegrationTest.
- Used Theories to run tests with head and direct buffers.
- Removed code duplicates.

Result:

Removed duplicated code of tests for compression codecs and simplified an addition of tests for new compression codecs.
