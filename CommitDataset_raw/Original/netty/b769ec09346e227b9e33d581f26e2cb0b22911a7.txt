Reduce overhead of cancel flowcontrolled writes.

Motivation:

When we cancel the flowcontrolled writes we did create a new StreamException for each write that was enqueued. Creating Exceptions is very expensive due of filling the stacktrace.

Modifications:

Only create the StreamException once and reuse the same for all the flowcontrolled writes (per stream).

Result:

Less expensive to cancel flowcontrolled writes.
