Correct fail write with NotYetConnectedException when OioDatagramChannel is not connected yet.

Motivation:

NioDatagramChannel fails a write with NotYetConnectedException when the DatagramChannel was not yet connected and a ByteBuf is written. The same should be done for OioDatagramChannel as well.

Modifications:

Make OioDatagramChannel consistent with NioDatagramChannel

Result:

Correct and consistent implementations of DatagramChannel
