Fix possible NPE in HttpCunkedInput if wrapped ChunkedInput.readChunk(...) return null.

Motivation:

Its completly fine for ChunkedInput.readChunk(...) to return null to indicate there is currently not any data to read. We need to handle this in HttpChunkedInput to not produce a NPE when constructing the HttpContent.

Modifications:

If readChunk(...) return null just return null as well.

Result:

No more NPE.
