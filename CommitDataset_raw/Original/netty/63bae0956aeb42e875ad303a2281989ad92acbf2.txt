Ensure ThreadDeathWatcher and GlobalEventExecutor will not cause classloader leaks.

Motivation:

ThreadDeathWatcher and GlobalEventExecutor may create and start a new thread from various other threads and so inherit the classloader. We need to ensure we not inherit to allow recycling the classloader.

Modifications:

Use Thread.setContextClassLoader(null) to ensure we not hold a strong reference to the classloader and so not leak it.

Result:

Fixes [#7290].
