ByteBufUtil writeUtf8 and writeAscii helper methods

Motivation:
Utility methods in ByteBufUtil to writeUtf8 and writeAscii expect a buffer to already be allocated. If the user does not have a buffer allocated they have to know details of the encoding in order to know the size of the buffer to allocate.

Modifications:
- Add writeUtf8 and writeAscii which take a ByteBufAllocator and allocate a ByteBuf of the correct size for the user

Result:
ByteBufUtil methods which are easier to use if the user doesn't already have a ByteBuf.
