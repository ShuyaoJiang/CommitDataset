Reduce the initial capacity of the value list from 4 to 2

Motivation:

DefaultTextHeaders.getAll*() methods create an ArrayList whose initial
capacity is 4.  However, it is more likely that the actual number of
values is smaller than that.

Modifications:

Reduce the initial capacity of the value list from 4 to 2

Result:

Slightly reduced memory footprint
