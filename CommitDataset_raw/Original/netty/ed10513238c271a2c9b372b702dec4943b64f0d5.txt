Fixed several issues with HttpContentDecoder

Motivation:

HttpContentDecoder had the following issues:
- For chunked content, the decoder set invalid "Content-Length" header
	with length of the first decoded chunk.
- Decoding of FullHttpRequests put both the original conent and decoded
	content into output. As result, using HttpObjectAggregator before the
	decoder lead to errors.
- Requests with "Expect: 100-continue" header were not acknowleged:
	the decoder didn't pass the header message down the handler's chain
	until content is received. If client expected "100 Continue" response,
	deadlock happened.

Modification:

- Invalid "Content-Length" header is removed; handlers down the chain can either
	rely on LastHttpContent message or ask HttpObjectAggregator to add the header.
- FullHttpRequest is split into HttpRequest and HttpContent (decoded) parts.
- Header (HttpRequest) part of request is sent down the chain as soon as it's received.

Result:

The issues are fixed, unittest is added.
