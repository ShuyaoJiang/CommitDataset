HTTP Content Decoder Cleanup Bug

Motiviation:
The HTTP content decoder's cleanup method is not cleaning up the decoder correctly.
The cleanup method is currently doing a readOutbound on the EmbeddedChannel but
for decoding the call should be readInbound.

Modifications:
-Change readOutbound to readInbound in the cleanup method

Result:
The cleanup method should be correctly releaseing unused resources
