[#473] Fix elevated context switching in SingleThreadEventExecutor

- Remove polling in SingleThreadEventExecutor
- Create a dedicated scheduled task scheduler called 'TaskScheduler'
- TaskScheduler is created per EventLoopGroup / EventExecutorGroup
- SingleThreadEventExecutor delegates all scheduled execution requests
  to TaskScheduler provided as a constructor parameter
- TaskScheduler is a specialized form of single threaded 
  ScheduledExecutorService which requires an EventExecutor as a
  parameter for all requests.
