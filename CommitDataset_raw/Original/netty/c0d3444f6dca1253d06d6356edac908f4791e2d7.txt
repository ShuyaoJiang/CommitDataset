DnsNameResolver should log in trace level if notification of the promise fails (#9022)

Motivation:

During investigating some other bug I noticed that we log with warn level if we fail to notify the promise due the fact that it is already full-filled. This is not correct and missleading as there is nothing wrong with it in general. A promise may already been fullfilled because we did multiple queries and one of these was successful.

Modifications:

- Change log level to trace
- Add unit test which before did log with warn level but now does with trace level.

Result:

Less missleading noise in the log.
