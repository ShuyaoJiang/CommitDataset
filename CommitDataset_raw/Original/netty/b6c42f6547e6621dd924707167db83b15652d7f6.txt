Use 198.51.100.254 as BAD_HOST for tests.

Motivation:

At the moment we use netty.io as BAD_HOST with an port that we know is timing out. This may change in the future so we should better use 198.51.100.254 which is specified as "for documentation only".

Modifications:

Replace netty.io with 198.51.100.254 in tests that depend on BAD_HOST.

Result:

More future proof code.
