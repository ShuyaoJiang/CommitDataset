Correctly add STREAM_WEIGHT header in InboundHttp2ToHttpAdapter.onPushPromiseRead(...)

Motivation:

The weight header with the default value is not set but it should be (rfc7540#5.3.5: …Pushed streams initially depend on their associated stream … are assigned a default weight of 16).

Modifications:

Add STREAM_WEIGHT header.

Result:

Correctly add headers.
