FixedCompositeByteBuf should allow to access memoryAddress / array when wrap a single buffer.

Motivation:

We should allow to access the memoryAddress / array of the FixedCompositeByteBuf when it only wraps a single ByteBuf. We do the same for CompositeByteBuf.

Modifications:

- Check how many buffers FixedCompositeByteBuf wraps and depending on it delegate the access to the memoryAddress / array
- Add unit tests.

Result:

Fixes [#7752].
