FileDescriptor writev core dump

Motivation:
FileDescriptor#writev calls JNI code, and that JNI code dereferences a NULL pointer which crashes the application. This occurs when writing a single CompositeByteBuf object with more than one component.

Modifications:
- Initialize the iovec iterator properly to avoid the core dump
- Fix the array length calculation if we aren't able to fit all the ByteBuffer objects in the iovec array

Result:
No more core dump.
