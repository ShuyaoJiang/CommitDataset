Explicit specify java version to use to ensure we rebuild image when java version changes. (#8397)

Motivation:

We should explicit specify the java version to use to ensure docker will rebuild the image once a new java version was released and we specify it. Also we should use openjdk for testing when possible.

Modifications:

- Explicit specify the java versions to use
- Use openjdk when possible.

Result:

Ensure latest java versions are used during testing
