Drop broken DefaultCookie name validation, close #4999

Motivation:

DefaultCookie constructor performs a name validation that doesnâ€™t match
RFC6265. Moreover, such validation is already performed in strict
encoders and decoders.

Modifications:

Drop DefaultCookie name validation, rely on encoders and decoders.

Result:

no more duplicate broken validation
