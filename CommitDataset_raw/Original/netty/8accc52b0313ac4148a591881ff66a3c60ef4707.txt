Forking Twitter's hpack

Motivation:

The twitter hpack project does not have the support that it used to have.  See discussion here: https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/4403.

Modifications:

Created a new module in Netty and copied the latest from twitter hpack master.

Result:

Netty no longer depends on twitter hpack.
