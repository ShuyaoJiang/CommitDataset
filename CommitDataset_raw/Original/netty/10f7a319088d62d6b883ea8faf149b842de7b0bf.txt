Fixed SpdySessionHandlerTest / Fixed NPE in EmbeddedChannel

- Some tests like SpdySessionHandlerTest accesses outbound buffer
  even before the outbound buffer is initialized by
  AbstractEmbeddedChannel's subclasses, leading to NPE at <init>.
  To fix this problem, subclasses now pass the outbound buffer as
  a constructor parameter to AbstractEmbeddedChannel.
