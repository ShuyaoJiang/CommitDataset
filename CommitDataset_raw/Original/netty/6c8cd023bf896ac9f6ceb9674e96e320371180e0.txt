[#5770] Use heapbuffers by default when using LocalChannel and LocalServerChannel.

Motivation:

The local transport is used to communicate in the same JVM so we should use heap buffers.

Modifications:

Use heapbuffers by default if not requested otherwise.

Result:

No allocating of direct buffers by default when using local transport
