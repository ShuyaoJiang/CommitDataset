Fix handling of non direct backed PemEncoded.

Motivation:

The private key and certificate that are passed into #serKeyMaterial() could be PemEncoded in which case the #toPEM() methods return the identity of the value.

That in turn will fail in the #toBIO() step because the underlying ByteBuf is not necessarily direct.

Modifications:

- Use toBIO(...) which also works with non direct PemEncoded values
- Add unit test.

Result:

Correct handling of PemEncoded.
