Removing unnecessary use of Math.ceil in HTTP/2 priority algorithm.

Motivation:

We're currently using Math.ceil which isn't necessary. We should exchange for a lighter weight operation.

Modifications:

Changing the logic to just ensure that we allocate at least one byte to the child rather than always performing a ceil.

Result:

Slight performance improvement in the priority algorithm.
