make the http2 codec void promise ready.

Motivation:

Void promises need special treatment, as they don't behave like normal promises. One
cannot add a listener to a void promise for example.

Modifications:

Inspected the code for addListener() calls, and added extra logic for void promises
where necessary. Essentially, when writing a frame with a void promise, any errors
are reported via the channel pipeline's exceptionCaught event.

Result:

The HTTP/2 codec has better support for void promises.
