[#2573] UnpooledUnsafeDirectByteBuf.setBytes(int,ByteBuf,int,int) fails to use fast-path when src has array

Motivation:

UnpooledUnsafeDirectByteBuf.setBytes(int,ByteBuf,int,int) fails to use fast-path when src uses an array as backing storage. This is because the if else uses the wrong ByteBuf for its check.

Modifications:

- Use correct ByteBuf when check for array as backing storage
- Also eliminate unecessary check in UnpooledDirectByteBuf which always fails anyway

Result:

Faster setBytes(...) when src ByteBuf is backed by an array.

No more IndexOutOfBoundsException or data-corruption.
