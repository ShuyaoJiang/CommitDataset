Correctly manage buffer life-cycle in http2 multiplex example

Motivation:

We not correctly managed the life-cycle of the buffer / frames in our http2 multiplex example which lead to a memory leak.

Modifications:

- Correctly release frame if not echo'ed back the remote peer.
- Not retain content before echo back to remote peer.

Result:

No more leak in the example, fixes [#6636].
