Remove backports of JDK8 classes

Motivation:

Java8 is out now for some time and JDK7 is no longer supported officially. We should remove all our backports and just use what the JDK provides us. This also will allow us to use intrinsics that are offered by the JDK implementations.

Modifications:

Remove all backports of jdk8 classes.

Result:

Use what the JDK offers us. This also fixes [#5458]
