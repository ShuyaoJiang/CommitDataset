More realistic ByteBuf allocation benchmark

Motivation:

Allocating a single buffer and releasing it repetitively for a benchmark will not involve the realistic execution path of the allocators.

Modifications:

Keep the last 8192 allocations and release them randomly.

Result:

We are now getting the result close to what we got with caliper.
