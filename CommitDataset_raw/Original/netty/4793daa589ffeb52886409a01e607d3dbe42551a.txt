Make Comparators Serializable

Motivation:

Objects of java.util.TreeMap or java.util.TreeSet will become
non-Serializable if instantiated with Comparators, which are not also
 Serializable. This can result in unexpected and difficult-to-diagnose
 bugs.

Modifications:

Implements Serializable for all classes, which implements Comparator.

Result:

Proper Comparators which will not force collections to
non-Serializable mode.
