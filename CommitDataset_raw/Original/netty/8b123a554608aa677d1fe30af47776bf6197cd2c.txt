Fix AbstractChannelTest errors caused by incorrect mocking

Motivation:

In AbstractChannelTest we not correctly mocked some methods which could lead to test errors. That said it only showed up here when running from the IDE and not from the cmdLine.

Modifications:

Mock methods that are needed for the test

Result:

Test pass in the IDE as well.
