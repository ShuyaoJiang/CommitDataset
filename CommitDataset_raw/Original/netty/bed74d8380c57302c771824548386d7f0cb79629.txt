Method to check if a Http2 header is present and has a given value

Motivation:

With HTTP1, it's very easy to check if a header is present and has a
given value: you can simply invoke
io.netty.handler.codec.http.HttpHeaders#contains(java.lang.CharSequence, java.lang.CharSequence, boolean)

It is not possible to do the same with HTTP2. You have to get the list
of all headers (returned as String) and then iterate over it invoking
String#equals or String#equalsIgnoreCase

Modifications:

I've added io.netty.handler.codec.http2.Http2Headers#contains and
implemented it in DefaultHttp2Headers, EmptyHttp2Headers and ReadOnlyHttp2Headers.

Result:

You can use AsciiString constants to check if a header is present in a
consice and efficient manner.
