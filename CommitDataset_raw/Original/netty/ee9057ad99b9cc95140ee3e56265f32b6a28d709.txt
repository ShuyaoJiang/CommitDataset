CorsHandler.write(...) should not cause a flush. (#7839)

Motivation:

Unnecessary flushes reduce the amount of flush coalescing that can happen at higher levels and thus can increase number of packets (because of TCP_NODELAY) and lower throughput (due to syscalls, TLS frames, etc)

Modifications:

Replace writeAndFlush(...) with write(...)

Result:

Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/7837.
