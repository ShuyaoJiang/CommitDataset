HTTP/2 Frame Writer Microbenchmark Fix

Motivation:
The Http2FrameWriterBenchmark JMH harness class name was not updated for the JVM arguments. The number of forks is 0 which means the JHM will share a JVM with the benchmarks.  Sharing the JVM may lead to less reliable benchmarking results and as doesn't allow for the command line arguments to be applied for each benchmark.

Modifications:
- Update the JMH version from 0.9 to 1.7.1.  Benchmarks wouldn't run on old version.
- Increase the number of forks from 0 to 1.
- Remove allocation of environment from static and cleanup AfterClass to using the Setup and Teardown methods. The forked JVM would not shut down correctly otherwise (and wait for 30+ seconds before timeing out).

Result:
Benchmarks that run as intended.
