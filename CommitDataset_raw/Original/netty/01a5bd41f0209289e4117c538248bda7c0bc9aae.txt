Add Channel.type() which tells if stream-oriented or message-oriented

- DefaultChannelPipeline uses this information to reject invalid buffer
  access in inbound(Message|Byte)Buffer.  Otherwise, a user can access
  a message buffer when the channel is stream-oriented.
- Because ChannelType cannot be both STREAM and MESSAGE, catch-all
  buffer has been removed to avoid confusion and unexpected behavior
  (it's already causing headache.)
- As a result, codec embedder needs rework.
