CipherSuiteConverter NPE

Motivation:
CipherSuiteConverter may throw a NPE if a cipher suite from OpenSSL does not match the precomputed regular expression for OpenSSL ciphers. This method shouldn't throw and instead just return null.

Modifications:
- if cacheFromOpenSsl(..) fails the conversion toJava should return null

Result:
Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/6336.
