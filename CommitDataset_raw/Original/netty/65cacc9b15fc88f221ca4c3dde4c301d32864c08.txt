Guard against NoClassDefFoundError when trying to load Unsafe.

Motivation:

OSGI and other enviroments may not allow to even load Unsafe which will lead to an NoClassDefFoundError when trying to access it. We should guard against this.

Modifications:

Catch NoClassDefFoundError when trying to load Unsafe.

Result:

Be able to use netty with a strict OSGI config.
