Channel writable bytes feature

Motivation:
To avoid buffering too much it would be useful to get an estimate of how many bytes can be written to a Channel before it becomes unwritable.

Modifications:
- Update the Channel interface to support 2 new methods. 1 to give how many bytes before unwritable. 1 to give how many bytes before writable.
- Update the AbstractChannel implementation to delegate to the ChannelOutboundBuffer.

Result:
The Channel interface supports 2 new methods which provide more visibility into writability.
