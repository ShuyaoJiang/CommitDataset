Propagate full Unsafe unavailability reason in PlatformDependent

Motivation:
It is not clear why Unsafe is unavailable when it is explicitly
disabled, or when Netty thinks it is running on Android.

Modification:
Change the "has" fields and methods to be causes.  A null cause
means Unsafe is present.  This catches all possible reason why
Unsafe might not be available.

Result:
Easier to debug Netty start up when logging cannot be turned on.
