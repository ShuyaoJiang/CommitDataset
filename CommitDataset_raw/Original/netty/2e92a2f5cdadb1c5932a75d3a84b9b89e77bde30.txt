Ensure we not schedule multiple timeouts for close notify

Motivation:

We should only schedule one timeout to wait for the close notify to be done.

Modifications:

Keep track of if we already scheduled a timeout for close notify and if so not schedule another one.

Result:

No duplicated timeouts.
