Add unit test that shows we correctly return BUFFER_UNDERFLOW

Motivation:

We should test that we correctly return BUFFER_UNDERFLOW if the src buffer not contains enough data to unwrap it.

Modification:

Add unit test to verify behaviour.

Result:

Better test coverrage of SSLEngine implementations.
