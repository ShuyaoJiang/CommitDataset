Fix NPE while decoding authority section of a DNS response

Motivation:

NullPointerException is raised when a DNS response conrains a resource
record whose NAME is empty, which is the case for the authority section.

Modification:

Allow an empty name for DnsEntry. Only disallow an empty name for
DnsQuestion.

Result:

Fixes #2686
