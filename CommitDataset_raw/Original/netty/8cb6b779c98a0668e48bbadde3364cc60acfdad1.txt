Add io.netty.noJdkZlibEncoder system property

Related issue: #2821

Motivation:

There's no way for a user to change the default ZlibEncoder
implementation.

It is already possible to change the default ZlibDecoder implementation.

Modification:

Add a new system property 'io.netty.noJdkZlibEncoder'.

Result:

A user can disable JDK ZlibEncoder, just like he or she can disable JDK
ZlibDecoder.
