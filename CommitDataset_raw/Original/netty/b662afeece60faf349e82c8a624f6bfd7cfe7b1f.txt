Correctly release all buffers in UnpooledTest

Motivation:

We not correctly released all buffers in the UnpooledTest and so showed "bad" way of handling buffers to people that inspect our code to understand when a buffer needs to be released.

Modifications:

Explicit release all buffers.

Result:

Cleaner and more correct code.
