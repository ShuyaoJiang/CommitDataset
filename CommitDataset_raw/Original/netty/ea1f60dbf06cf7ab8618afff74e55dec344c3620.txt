Replace DomainNameMapping.entries() with asMap()

Motivation:

DomainNameMapping.entries() returns Set<Map.Entry<String, V>>, which
doesn't sound very natural.

Modifications:

Replace entries() with asMap() which returns a Map<String, V> instead.

Result:

- Better looking API
- User can do a lookup because it's a Map
