Upgrade h2spec-maven-plugin (#8386)

Motivation:
- Version 0.3 would sometimes fail to report failing tests
- New version contains upgraded version of h2spec

Modifications:
- Bump h2spec-maven-plugin to 0.6
- Remove excluded specs that are no passing
- Add failing spec "half closed (remote): Sends a HEADERS frame" to
exclude list

Result:
Build will fail when non excluded specs fails.
