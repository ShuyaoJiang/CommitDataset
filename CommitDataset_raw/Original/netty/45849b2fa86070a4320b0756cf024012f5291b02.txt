Deprecate PromiseAggregator

Motivation:
PromiseAggregator's API allows for the aggregate promise to complete before the user is done adding promises. In order to support this use case the API structure would need to change in a breaking manner.

Modifications:
- Deprecate PromiseAggregator and subclasses
- Introduce PromiseCombiner which corrects these issues

Result:
PromiseCombiner corrects the deficiencies in PromiseAggregator.
