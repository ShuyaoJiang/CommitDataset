Directly use memory addresses for gathering writes to reduce gc pressure. Part of [#2239]

This also does factor out some logic of ChannelOutboundBuffer. Mainly we not need nioBuffers() for many
transports and also not need to copy from heap to direct buffer. So this functionality was moved to
NioSocketChannelOutboundBuffer. Also introduce a EpollChannelOutboundBuffer which makes use of
memory addresses for all the writes to reduce GC pressure
