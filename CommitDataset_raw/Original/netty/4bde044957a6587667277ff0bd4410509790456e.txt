Overall cleanup of codec-dns

Related issue: #2688

- DnsClass and DnsType
  - Make DnsClass and DnsType implement Comparable
  - Optimize the message generation of IllegalArgumentException,
    by pre-populating the list of the expected parameters
  - Move the static methods up
  - Relax the validation rule of DnsClass so that a user can define a
    CLASS which is not listed in the RFC 1035
  - valueOf(int) does not throw IllegalArgumentException anymore as long
    as the specified value is an unsigned short.
  - Rename create() and forName() to valueOf() so that they look like a
    real enum
  - Rename type() and clazz() to intValue() so that they conform to our
    naming convention
- Add missing null checks in DnsEntry
