NioEventLoop.register(...) should offload to the EventLoop if not alrâ€¦ (#8612)


Motivation:

java.nio.channels.spi.AbstractSelectableChannel.register(...) need to obtain multiple locks during execution which may produce a long wait time if we currently select. This lead to multiple CI failures in the past.

Modifications:

Ensure the register call takes place on the EventLoop.

Result:

No more flacky CI test timeouts.
