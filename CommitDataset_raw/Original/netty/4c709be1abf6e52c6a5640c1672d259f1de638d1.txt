Print correct invalid character after unwrapping value in CookieEncoder

Motivation:

If a wrapped cookie value with an invalid charcater is passed to the strict
encoder, an exception is thrown on validation but the error message contains
a character at the wrong position.

Modifications:

Print `unwrappedValue.charAt(pos)` instead of `value.charAt(pos)`.

Result:

The exception indicates the correct invalid character in the unwrapped cookie.
