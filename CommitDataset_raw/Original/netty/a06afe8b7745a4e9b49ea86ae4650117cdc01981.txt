Improvement: simplified AbstractConstant compareTo.

Motivation:

AbstractConstant.compareTo seems complex and hard to understand. Also it allocates unnecessary 1 byte in direct buffer and holds unnecessary pointer to this byte butter.

Modifications:

uniquifier (id) variable now initialized during Constant creation and thus no need in volatile and no need in uniquifier() method as it could be easily replaced with AtomicLong.

Result:

Every Constant instance now consumes less bytes for pointer, don't consume anything in direct buffer.
