Calculate correct count for tiny/small/normal allocation

Motivation:

Disable ThreadLocal Cache, then allocate Pooled ByteBuf and release all these buffers, PoolArena's tiny/small/normal allocation count is incorrect.

Modifications:

- Calculate PoolArena's tiny/small/normal allocation one time
- Add testAllocationCounter TestCase

Result:

Fixes #6282 .
