ChannelInitializer: change propagation of channelRegistered event

Motivation:

If a handler is added to the pipeline within ChannelInitializer::initChannel via
addFirst(...) then it will not receive the channelRegistered event.  The same
handler added via addLast(...) will receive the event.  This different behavior
is unlikely to be expected by users and can cause confusion.

Modifications:

Let ChannelInitializer::channelRegistered propagate the event by passing it to
the pipeline instead of firing it on the ChannelHandlerContext.

Result:

The channelRegistered event is propagated to handlers regardless of the method
used to add it to the pipeline (addFirst/addLast).
