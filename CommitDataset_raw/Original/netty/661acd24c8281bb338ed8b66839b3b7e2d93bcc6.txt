Fixed issue: NETTY-272 HttpMessageEncoder should not prepend/append extra data around HttpChunk content if Transfer-Encoding is not chunked.
* HttpMessageEncoder now does not add any extra data around HttpChunk content if Transfer-Encoding is not 'chunked'
* Moved the utility code that checks the existance of 'Transfer-Encoding: chunked' to HttpCodecUtil so that both HttpMessageEncoder and DefaultHttpMessage can use it
