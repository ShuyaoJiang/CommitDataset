Ensure OpenSslEngine will not try to call SSL_free multiple times even when constructor throws. (#8399)

Motivation:

When the constructor of OpenSslEngine threw we could end up to self call SSL_free by ourself and then have the finalizer do the same which may lead to double free-ing and so SIGSEV.

Modifications:

Just call shutdown() when the constructor throws and so ensure SSL_free is guarded correctly in the finalizer.

Result:

No more SIGSEV possible.
