Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec should handle 100-Continue properly

Motivation:
Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec was not properly encoding and
decoding 100-Continue HttpResponse/Http2SettingsFrame properly. It was
encoding 100-Continue FullHttpResponse as an Http2SettingFrame with
endStream=true, causing the child channel to terminate. It was not
decoding 100-Continue Http2SettingsFrame (endStream=false) as
FullHttpResponse. This should be fixed as it would cause http2 child
stream to prematurely close, and could cause HttpObjectAggregator to
fail if it's in the pipeline.

Modification:
- Fixed encode() to properly encode 100-Continue FullHttpResponse as
  Http2SettingsFrame with endStream=false
- Reject 100-Continue HttpResponse that are NOT FullHttpResponse
- Fixed decode() to properly decode 100-Continue Http2SettingsFrame
  (endStream=false) as a FullHttpResponse
- made Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec sharable so that it can b used
  among child streams within the same Http2MultiplexCodec

Result:
Now Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec should be properly handling
100-Continue responses.
