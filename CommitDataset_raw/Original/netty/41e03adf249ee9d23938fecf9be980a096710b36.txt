Mark ChannelHandler.exceptionCaught(...) as deprected.

Motivation:

exceptionCaught(...) will only handle inbound exceptions which means it makes not much sense to have it also on ChannelOutboundHandler. Because of this we should move it to ChannelInboundHandler.

Modifications:

Add @deprecated annotation to ChannelHandler.exceptionCaught(...).

Result:

Preapre to cleanup the API in later release.
