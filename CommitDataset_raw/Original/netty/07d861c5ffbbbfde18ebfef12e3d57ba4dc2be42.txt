Fix a bug where DnsNameResolver attempts to send extra queries

Motivation:

When DnsNameResolverContext succeeds to get the address(es), it cancels
the promise of other queries in progress.

Unlike expectation, DnsNameResolverContext.query() attempts to retry
even when the query has failed due to cancellation.

As a result, the resolver sends unnecessary extra queries to a DNS
server and then tries to mark the promised that's been fulfilled
already, leading to unnecessarily verbose 'failed to notify success to a
promise' messages.

Modifications:

Do not perform an extra query when the previous query has failed due to
cancellation

Result:

DnsNameResolver does not send unnecessary extra queries and thus does
not log the 'failed to notify success to a promise' message.
