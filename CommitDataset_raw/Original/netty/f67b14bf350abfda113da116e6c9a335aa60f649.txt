[#3680] Enabled SecurityManager results in ClassNotFoundError during io.netty.util.NetUtil initialization

Motivation:

When a SecurityManager is in place that preven reading the somaxconn file trying to bootstrap a channel later will result in a ClassNotFoundError.

Modifications:

- Reading the file in a privileged block.

Result:

No more ClassNotFoundError when a SecurityManager is in place.
