Respect resolvedAddressTypes when follow CNAME records.

Motivation:

When we follow CNAME records we should respect resolvedAddressTypes and only query A / AAAA depending on which address types are expected.

Modifications:

Check if we should query A / AAAA when follow CNAMEs depending on resolvedAddressTypes.

Result:

Correct behaviour when follow CNAMEs.
