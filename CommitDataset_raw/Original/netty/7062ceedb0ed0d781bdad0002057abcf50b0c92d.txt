Simplify ByteBufInputStream.readLine() logic (#8380)

Motivation:

While looking at the nice optimization done in
https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8347 I couldn't help noticing the
logic could be simplified further. Apologies if this is just my OCD and
inappropriate!

Modifications:

Reduce amount of code used for ByteBufInputStream.readLine()

Result:

Slightly smaller and simpler code
