Improve performance of Base64.decode and encode methods.

Motivation:

The decode and encode method uses getByte(...) and setByte(...) in loops which can be very expensive because of bounds / reference-count checking. Beside this it also slows-down a lot when paranoid leak-detection is enabled as it will track each access.

Modifications:

- Pack bytes into int / short and so reduce operations on the ByteBuf
- Use ByteProcessor to reduce getByte calls.

Result:

Better performance in general. Also when you run the build with -Pleak the handler module will build in 1/4 of the time it took before.
