Optimize FrameDecoder and ReplayingDecoder

* Overall code cleanup on FrameDecoder and ReplayingDecoder
* FrameDecoder discards readableBytes only when it has to
* Replaced createCumulationDynamicBuffer with newCumulationBuffer with
  an additional hint
* ReplayingDecoder does not perform memory copy if possible
