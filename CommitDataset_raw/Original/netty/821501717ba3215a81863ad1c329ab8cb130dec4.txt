Fix possible IOOBE when calling ReferenceCountedSslEngine.unwrap(...) with heap buffers.

Motivation:

fc3c9c9523150190760801dd0fbf014909519942 introduced a bug which will have ReferenceCountedSslEngine.unwrap(...) produce an IOOBE when be called with an BÅ·teBuffer as src that contains multiple SSLRecords and has a position != 0.

Modification:

- Correctly set the limit on the ByteBuffer and so fix the IOOBE.
- Add test-case to verify the fix

Result:

Correctly handle heap buffers as well.
