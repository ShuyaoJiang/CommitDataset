HttpMethod#valueOf improvement

Motivation:
HttpMethod#valueOf shows up on profiler results in the top set of
results. Since it is a relatively simple operation it can be improved in
isolation.

Modifications:
- Introduce a special case map which assigns each HttpMethod to a unique
index in an array and provides constant time lookup from a hash code
algorithm. When the bucket is matched we can then directly do equality
comparison instead of potentially following a linked structure when
HashMap has hash collisions.

Result:
~10% improvement in benchmark results for HttpMethod#valueOf
