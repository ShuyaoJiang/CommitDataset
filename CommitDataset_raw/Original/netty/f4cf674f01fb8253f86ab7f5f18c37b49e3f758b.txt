Fix NPE when trying to build a DnsNameResolver with a null resolvedAddressTypes (#8445)

Motivation:

It should be possible to build a DnsNameResolver with a null resolvedAddressTypes, defaulting then to DEFAULT_RESOLVE_ADDRESS_TYPES (see line 309).

Sadly, `preferredAddressType` is then called on line 377 with the original parameter instead of the instance attribute, causing an NPE when it's null.

Modification:

Call preferredAddressType with instance attribuet instead of constructor parameter.

Result:

No more NPE
