Expose ByteBufAllocator metric in a more general way

Motivation:

PR [#6460] added a way to access the used memory of an allocator. The used naming was not very good and how things were exposed are not consistent.

Modifications:

- Add a new ByteBufAllocatorMetric and ByteBufAllocatorMetricProvider interface
- Let the ByteBufAllocator implementations implement ByteBufAllocatorMetricProvider
- Move exposed stats / metric from PooledByteBufAllocator to PooledByteBufAllocatorMetric and mark old methods as `@Deprecated`.

Result:

More consistent way to expose metric / stats for ByteBufAllocator
