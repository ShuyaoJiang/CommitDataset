Defer channelInactive and channelUnregistered events in Http2MultiplexCodec (#8021)

Motivation:

There is an inconsistency between the order of events in the
StreamChannel implementation in Http2MultiplexCodec and other Channel
implementations that extend AbstractChannel where channelInactive and
channelUnregistered events are not performed 'later'. This can cause an
unexected order of events for ChannelHandler implementations that call
Channel.close() in response to some event.

Modification:

The Http2MultiplexCodec.DefaultHttp2StreamChannel.Http2ChannelUnsafe was
modified to bounce the deregistration and channelInactive events through
the parent channels EventLoop.

Result:

Stream events are now in the proper order.

Fixes #8018.
