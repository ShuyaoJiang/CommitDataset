HTTP to HTTP/2 tranlation errors

Motivation:
HttpUtil.toHttp2Headers is currently not translating HTTP request headers to HTTP/2 request headers correctly.  The path, scheme, and authority are tranlation process are not respecting the HTTP/2 RFC https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-8.1.2.3 and HTTP RFC https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-5.3.

Modifications:
- path, scheme, authority must be set according to rules defined in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-8.1.2.3
- HTTP/1.x URIs must be handled as defined in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-5.3

Result:
More correct translation from HTTP/1.x requests to HTTP/2 requests.
