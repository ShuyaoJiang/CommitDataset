HTTP2: Close encoder and decoder on channelInactive and initialize clientPrefaceString on handlerAdded.

Motivation:

- The encoder and decoder should be closed right after the handler releases its resources.
- The clientPrefaceString is allocated in the constructor but releases in handlerRemoved.
  If the handler is never added to the pipeline, the clientPrefaceString will never be
  released.

Modifications:

- Call encoder.close() and decoder.close() on channelInactive.
- Release the clientPrefaceString on handlerRemoved.

Result:

- The encoder and decoder get closed right after the handler's resources are freed.
- It's easier to verify that the clientPrefaceString will also get released.
