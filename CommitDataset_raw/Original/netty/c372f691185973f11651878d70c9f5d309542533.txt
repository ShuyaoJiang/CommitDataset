http2.HttpConversionUtil :authority conversion error

Motiviation:
The http2 spec https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-8.1.2.3 states that the :authority header should be copied into the HOST header when converting from HTTP/2 to HTTP/1.x. We currently have an extension header to preserve the authority.

Modifications:
- Remove AUTHORITY extension header
- HTTP/2 :authority should map to HOST header when converting to HTTP/1.x.

Result:
More spec compliant.
