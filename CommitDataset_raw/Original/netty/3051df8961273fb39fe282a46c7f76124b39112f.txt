Ensure accessing System property is done via AccessController.

Motivation:

When a SecurityManager is in place it may dissallow accessing the property which will lead to not be able to load the application.

Modifications:

Use AccessController.doPrivileged(...)

Result:

No more problems with SecurityManager.
