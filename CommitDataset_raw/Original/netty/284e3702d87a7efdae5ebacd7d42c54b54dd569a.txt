Http2ConnectionHandler Builder instead of constructors

Motivation:
Using the builder pattern for Http2ConnectionHandler (and subclasses) would be advantageous for the following reasons:
1. Provides the consistent construction afforded by the builder pattern for 'optional' arguments. Users can specify these options 1 time in the builder and then re-use the builder after this.
2. Enforces that the Http2ConnectionHandler's internals (decoder Http2FrameListener) are initialized after construction.

Modifications:
- Add an extensible builder which can be used to build Http2ConnectionHandler objects
- Update classes which inherit from Http2ConnectionHandler

Result:
It is easier to specify options and construct Http2ConnectionHandler objects.
