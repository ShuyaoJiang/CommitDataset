Second round of new channel handler API design

- Rename ChannelReader to ChannelInboundHandler
- Rename ChannelWriter to ChannelOutboundHandler
- Introduce ChannelBufferHolder instead of adding the common super type
  of message buffers and byte buffers
  - This is more type-safe and natural.
- Remove the notification methods for buffer closure (might add back
  later when revisiting half-closed connection support)
