Fix performance regression in FastThreadLocal microbenchmark. Fixes #4402

Motivation:

As reported in #4402, the FastThreadLocalBenchmark shows that the JDK ThreadLocal
is actually faster than Netty's custom thread local implementation.

I was looking forward to doing some deep digging, but got disappointed :(.

Modifications:

The microbenchmark was not using FastThreadLocalThreads and would thus always hit the slow path.
I updated the JMH command line flags, so that FastThreadLocalThreads would be used.

Result:

FastThreadLocalBenchmark shows FastThreadLocal to be faster than JDK's ThreadLocal implementation,
by about 56% in this particular benchmark. Run on OSX El Capitan with OpenJDK 1.8u60.
