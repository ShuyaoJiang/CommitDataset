Optimizing user-defined stream properties.

Motivation:

Streams currently maintain a hash map of user-defined properties, which has been shown to add significant memory overhead as well as being a performance bottleneck for lookup of frequently used properties.

Modifications:

Modifying the connection/stream to use an array as the storage of user-defined properties, indexed by the class that identifies the index into the array where the property is stored.

Result:

Stream processing performance should be improved.
