Fix race in PoolArena.allocate. Fixes #4829

Motivation:

The statistic counters PoolArena.(allocationsTiny|allocationsSmall) are
not protected by a per arena lock, but by a per size class lock. Thus,
two concurrent allocations of different size (class) could lead to a
race and ultimately to wrong statistics.

Modifications:

Use a thread-safe LongCounter instead of a plain long data type.

Result:

Fewer data races.
