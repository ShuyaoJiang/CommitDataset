Determine CompositeByteBuf implementation by using ByteBufAllocator

Motivation:

Currently, using a MessageAggregator in the pipeline always results in the creation of an unpooled heap CompositeByteBuf. By using the ByteBufAllocator the CompositeByteBuf will use the implementation specified by the ByteBufAllocator.

Modifications:

Use the ChannelHandlerContext's ByteBufAllocator to create the CompositeByteBuf for message aggregation

Result:

The CompositeByteBuf is now configured based on the ByteBufAllocator's settings.
