Cleanup EPOLL native exceptions

Motivation:
Exceptions generated from transport-native-epoll may include duplicate error string description or inconsistent usage of the method name in the string description.

Modifications:
- Ensure the method name from static exceptions and dynamic exceptions is of the same format
- Remove duplicate string rational from the exception messages

Result:
More consistent error messages with no duplicate error description.
