Fixed issue: NETTY-180 Channel.getRemoteAddress() can return null for a received MessageEvent when ExecutionHandler is in the pipeline.
* DatagramChannel implementations cache localAddresses now
* DatagramChannel implementations don't cache remoteAddress because a user can disconnect and then connect again.  However, MessageEvent.getRemoteAddress() will always have correct remoteAddress value, so it shouldn't be a problem at all.
