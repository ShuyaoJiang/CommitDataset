[#5391] DnsNameResolver does not resolve property A+CNAME answer

Motivation:

The current DnsNameResolver fails to resolve an A+CNAME answer. For example:

dig moose.rmq.cloudamqp.com

...
;; ANSWER SECTION:
moose.rmq.cloudamqp.com. 1800   IN  CNAME   ec2-54-152-221-139.compute-1.amazonaws.com.
ec2-54-152-221-139.compute-1.amazonaws.com. 583612 IN A 54.152.221.139
...

The resolver constructs a map of cnames but forgets the trailing "." in the values which lead to not resolve the A record.

Modifications:

Reuse the code of DefaltDnsRecordDecoder which correctly handles the trailing dot.

Result:

Correctly resolve.
