Motivation:

Sometimes people may want to trade GC with memory overhead. For this it can be useful to allow to change the capacity of the array that is hold in the Link that is used by the Recycler internally.

Modifications:

Introduce a new system property , io.netty.recycler.linkCapacity which allows to change the capcity.

Result:

More flexible configuration of netty.
