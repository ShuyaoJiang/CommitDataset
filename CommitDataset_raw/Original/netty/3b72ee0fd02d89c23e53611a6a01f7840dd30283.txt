Add includeScope to not include test dependencies for maven-dependency-plugin

Motivation:

maven-dependency-plugin will include dependencies of all scopes by default. We should limit the scope to avoid pulling test dependencies. See #5317.

Modifications:

Add includeScope to avoid pulling test dependencies.

Result:

netty-all doesn't include codes from netty-build
