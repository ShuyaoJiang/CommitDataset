Use jetty-alpn-agent to simplify pom.xml

Motivation:

We had to add a new profile for each OpenJDK/OracleJDK release to make
Maven choose the correct alpn-boot.jar and npn-boot.jar. As a result,
our pom.xml has a large number of `<profile/>` sections.

Modifications:

- Use jetty-alpn-agent, which chooses the correct alpn-boot.jar and
  npn-boot.jar automatically to remove all the nasty profile sections
  from pom.xml
  - Visit https://github.com/trustin/jetty-alpn-agent for more info

Result:

Cleaner pom.xml
