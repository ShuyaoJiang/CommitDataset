Cookie name must be case sensitive

Motivation:

RFC 6265 does not state that cookie names must be case insensitive.

Modifications:

Fix io.netty.handler.codec.http.cookie.DefaultCookie#equals() method to
use case sensitive String#equals() and String#compareTo().

Result:

It is possible to parse several cookies with same names but with
different cases.
