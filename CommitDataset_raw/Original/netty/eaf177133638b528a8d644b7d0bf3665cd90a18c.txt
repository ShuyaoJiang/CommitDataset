Don't use VM.maxDirectMemory() on z/OS to retrieve direct memory limit. (#7886)

Motivation:

On z/OS netty initializes this value with 64M, even the direct accessible memory is actually unbounded.

Modifications:

Skip usage of VM.maxDirectMemory() on z/OS.

Result:

More correct direct memory limit detection. Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/7654.
