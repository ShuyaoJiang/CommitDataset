UnixResolverDnsServerAddressStreamProviderTest failure

Motivation:
InetSocketAddress#getHostName() may attempt a reverse lookup which may lead to test failures because the expected address will not match.

Modifications:
- Use InetSocketAddress#getHostString() which will not attempt any lookups and instead return the original String

Result:
UnixResolverDnsServerAddressStreamProviderTest is more reliable.
