Ensure tests pass when sun.misc.Unsafe is not present

Motivation:

We need to ensure we pass all tests when sun.misc.Unsafe is not present.

Modifications:

- Make *ByteBufAllocatorTest work whenever sun.misc.Unsafe is present or not
- Let Lz4FrameEncoderTest not depend on AbstractByteBufAllocator implementation details which take into account if sun.misc.Unsafe is present or not

Result:

Tests pass even without sun.misc.Unsafe.
