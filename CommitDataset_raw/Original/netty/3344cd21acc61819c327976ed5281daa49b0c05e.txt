Wrap operations requiring SocketPermission with doPrivileged blocks

Motivation:

Currently Netty does not wrap socket connect, bind, or accept
operations in doPrivileged blocks. Nor does it wrap cases where a dns
lookup might happen.

This prevents an application utilizing the SecurityManager from
isolating SocketPermissions to Netty.

Modifications:

I have introduced a class (SocketUtils) that wraps operations
requiring SocketPermissions in doPrivileged blocks.

Result:

A user of Netty can grant SocketPermissions explicitly to the Netty
jar, without granting it to the rest of their application.
