EpollEventLoopGroup support Executor

Motivation:
NioEventLoopGroup supports constructors which take an executor but EpollEventLoopGroup does not. EPOLL should be consistent with NIO where ever possible.

Modifications:
- Add constructors to EpollEventLoopGroup which accept an Executor as a parameter

Result:
EpollEventLoopGroup is more consistent with NioEventLoopGroup
