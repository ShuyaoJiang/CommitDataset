Ensure we only call debugData.release() if we called  debugData.retain()

Motivation:

We need to ensure we only call debugData.release() if we called debugData.retain(), otherwise we my see an IllegalReferenceCountException.

Modifications:

Only call release() if we called retain().

Result:

No more IllegalReferenceCountException possible.
