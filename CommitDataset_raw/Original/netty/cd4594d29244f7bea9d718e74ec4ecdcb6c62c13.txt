Add DnsNameResolver.resolveAll(DnsQuestion) (#7803)

* Add DnsNameResolver.resolveAll(DnsQuestion)

Motivation:

A user is currently expected to use DnsNameResolver.query() when he or
she wants to look up the full DNS records rather than just InetAddres.

However, query() only performs a single query. It does not handle
/etc/hosts file, redirection, CNAMEs or multiple name servers.

As a result, such a user has to duplicate all the logic in
DnsNameResolverContext.

Modifications:

- Refactor DnsNameResolverContext so that it can send queries for
  arbitrary record types.
  - Rename DnsNameResolverContext to DnsResolveContext
  - Add DnsAddressResolveContext which extends DnsResolveContext for
    A/AAAA lookup
  - Add DnsRecordResolveContext which extends DnsResolveContext for
    arbitrary lookup
- Add DnsNameResolverContext.resolveAll(DnsQuestion) and its variants
- Change DnsNameResolverContext.resolve() delegates the resolve request
  to resolveAll() for simplicity
- Move the code that decodes A/AAAA record content to DnsAddressDecoder

Result:

- Fixes #7795
- A user does not have to duplicate DnsNameResolverContext in his or her
  own code to implement the usual DNS resolver behavior.
