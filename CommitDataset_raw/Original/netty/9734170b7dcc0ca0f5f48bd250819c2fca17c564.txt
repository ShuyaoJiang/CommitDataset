Use value types for class and type in DNS entries to make them immune to parameter order bugs

Motivation:

DNS class and type were represented as integers rather than an enum or a
similar dedicated value type.  This can be a potential source of a
parameter order bug which might be difficult to track down.

Modifications:

Add DnsClass and DnsType to replace integer parameters

Result:

Type safety and less error-proneness
