HttpConversionUtil does not account for COOKIE compression

Motivation:
The HTTP/2 RFC allows for COOKIE values to be split into individual header elements to get more benefit from compression (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-8.1.2.5). HttpConversionUtil was not accounting for this behavior.

Modifications:
- Modify HttpConversionUtil to support compressing and decompressing the COOKIE values

Result:
HttpConversionUtil is compatible with https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-8.1.2.5)
Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/4457
