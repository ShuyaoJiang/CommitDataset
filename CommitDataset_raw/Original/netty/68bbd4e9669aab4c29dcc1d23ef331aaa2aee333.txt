Handle only those http requests that equal to adjusted websocket path

Motivation:

It will be easier to support websockets in server application by using WebSocketServerProtocolHandshakeHandler class and not reinvent its functionality. But currently it handles all http requests as if they were websocket handshake requests.

Modifications:

Check if http request path is equals to adjusted websocket path.
Fixed example of websocket server implementation.

Result:

WebSocketServerProtocolHandshakeHandler handles only websocket handshake requests.
