Not log notify failure for DelegatingChannelPromiseNotifier when promise is VoidChannelPromise

Motivation:

We should not log by default if the promise is a VoidChannelPromise as its try* methods will always return false.

Modifications:

Do an instanceof check to determine if we should log or not by default

Result:

No more noise in the logs when using a VoidChannelPromise.
