Make osgi testing work with java>=9 by updating to felix framework 5.6.10 (#7923)

Motivation:

Currently, the testing-osgi is set to skip if run with java>=9. That is not necessary when using a newer version of Felix.

Modification:

Update to Felix framework 5.6.10 (which has better jpms support), add some more --add-opens to not have WARN messages, and remove the skipOsgiTestsuite setting from the parent pom.

Result:

OSGi tests run and pass on java>=9.
