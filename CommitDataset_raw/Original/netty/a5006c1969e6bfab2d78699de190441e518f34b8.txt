Add a EventLoopGroup.register(ChannelPromise)

Motivation:

EventLoopGroup.register doesn't need the Channel paramter when ChannelPromise is provided as we can get the Channel from ChannelPromise. Resolves #2422.

Modifications:

- Add EventLoopGroup.register(ChannelPromise)
- Deprecate EventLoopGroup.register(Channel, ChannelPromise)

Result:

EventLoopGroup.register is more convenient as people only need to set one parameter.
