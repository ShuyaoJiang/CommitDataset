HTTP/2 Priority Tree Benchmark

Motivation:
There is no benchmark to measure the priority tree implementation performance.

Modifications:
Introduce a new benchmark which will populate the priority tree, and then shuffle parent/child links around.

Result:
A simple benchmark to get a baseline for the HTTP/2 codec's priority tree implementation.
