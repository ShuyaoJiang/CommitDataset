Fix PoolChunkList.minUsage() and maxUsage() for head and tail

Motivation:

The PoolChunkList.minUsage() and maxUsage() needs to take special action to translate Integer.MIN_VALUE / MAX_VALUE as these are used internal for tail and head of the linked-list structure.

Modifications:

- Correct the minUsage() and maxUsage() methods.
- Add unit test.

Result:

Correct metrics
