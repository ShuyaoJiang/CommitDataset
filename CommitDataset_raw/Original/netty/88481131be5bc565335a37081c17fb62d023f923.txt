[#2353] Use a privileged block to get ClassLoader and System property if needed

Motivation:
When using System.getProperty(...) and various methods to get a ClassLoader it will fail when a SecurityManager is in place.

Modifications:
Use a priveled block if needed. This work is based in the PR #2353 done by @anilsaldhana .

Result:
Code works also when SecurityManager is present
