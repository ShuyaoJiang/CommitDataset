Increase default bits for SelfSignedCertificate (#9019)

Motivation:
During OpenSsl.java initialization, a SelfSignedCertificate is created
during the static initialization block to determine if OpenSsl
can be used.

The default key strength for SelfSignedCertificate was too low if FIPS
mode is used and BouncyCastle-FIPS is the only available provider
(necessary for compliance). A simple fix is to just augment the key
strength to the minimum required about by FIPS.

Modification:
Set default key bit length to 2048 but also allow it to be dynamically set via a system property for future proofing to more stricter security compliance.

Result:
Fixes #9018
