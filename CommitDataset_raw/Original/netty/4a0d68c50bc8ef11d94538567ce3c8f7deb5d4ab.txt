[#3881] FixedChannelPool creates 1 more channel than maxConnections

Motivation:

FixedChannelPool should enforce a number of maximal used channels, but due a bug we fail to correctly enforce this.

Modifications:

Change check to correctly only acquire channel if we not hit the limit yet.

Result:

Correct limiting.
