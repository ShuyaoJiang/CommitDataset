Require RHEL/CentOS 6.7 for releasing Netty

Motivation:

6.7 is the latest stable release in RHEL/CentOS 6 line. Given that most
RHEL/CentOS users have upgraded to 6.7 via yum upgrade, we should bump
our requirement.

Modification:

s/6.6/6.7/g

Result:

'mvn release:*' must be run on RHEL/CentOS 6.7 instead of 6.6.
