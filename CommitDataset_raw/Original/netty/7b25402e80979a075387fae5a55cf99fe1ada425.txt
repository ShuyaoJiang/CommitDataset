Add CompositeByteBuf.addComponent(boolean ...) method to simplify usage

Motivation:

At the moment the user is responsible to increase the writer index of the composite buffer when a new component is added. We should add some methods that handle this for the user as this is the most popular usage of the composite buffer.

Modifications:

Add new methods that autoamtically increase the writerIndex when buffers are added.

Result:

Easier usage of CompositeByteBuf.
