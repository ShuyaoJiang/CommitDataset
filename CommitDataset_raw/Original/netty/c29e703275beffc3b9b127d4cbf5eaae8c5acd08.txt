Use Proxy-Authorization instead of Authorization for proxy authentication

Motivation:

When authenticating with a proxy server, HttpProxyHandler should use the
'Proxy-Authorization' header rather than the 'Authorization' header.

Modifications:

- Use 'Proxy-Authorization' header

Result:

Can connect to an HTTP proxy server
