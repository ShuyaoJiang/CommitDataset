Only increment metric for huge / normal allocations after the allocation was really done.

Motivation:

We should only increment the metric for the huge / normal allocation after it is done. Also we should only decrement once deallocate.

Modifications:

- Move increment after the allocation.
- Fix deallocation metric and move it after deallocation

Result:

More correct metrics.
