Add optimized version of setZero(...) / writeZero(...) for Unsafe*ByteBuf implementations

Motivation:

Unsafe offers a method to set memory to a specific value. This can be used to implement an optimized version of setZero(...) and writeZero(...)

Modifications:

Add implementation for all Unsafe*ByteBuf implementations.

Result:

Faster setZero(...) and writeZero(...)
