Adjustable size of DefaultHeaders array

Motivation:
DefaultHeaders creates an array of size 16 for all headers. This may waste a good deal of memory if applications only have a small number of headers. This memory may be critical when the number of connections grows large.

Modifications:
- Make the size of the array for DefaultHeaders configurable

Result:
Applications can control the size of the DefaultHeaders array and save memory.
