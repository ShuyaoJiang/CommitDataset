Server returns status 431 on header size errors

Motivation:

Currently clients attempting to send headers that are too large recieve
a RST frame. This makes it harder than needed for implementations on top
of netty to handle this in a graceful way.

Modifications:

When the Decoder throws a StreamError of type FRAME_SIZE_ERROR, the
Http2ConnectionHandler will now attempt to send an Http2Header with
status 431 and endOfStream=true

Result:

Implementations now do not have to subclass parts of netty to handle
431s
