Revert "[#1442] Make sure closing the channel will not cause an UnsupportedOperationException"

This reverts commit a1a86b9de48e4696e3496904dd972336f57b4a0b because the
semantic of ctx.isRemoved() is confusing to a user - why is
ctx.isRemoved() false when handlerRemoved() is invoked? A better
solution would be check if the connection is inactive and mark the
promise as failure before attempting to write anything.
