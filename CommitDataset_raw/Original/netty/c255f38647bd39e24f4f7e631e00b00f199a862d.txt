Correction on StringBuilder default init size

Motivation:
The default StringBuilder size is too small (data.length + 4) while it will be 2*data.length (byte to Hex) + 5 "-" char (since 5 peaces appended).

Modification:
Changing initial size to the correct one

Result:
Allocation of the correct final size from the beginning for this StringBuilder.
