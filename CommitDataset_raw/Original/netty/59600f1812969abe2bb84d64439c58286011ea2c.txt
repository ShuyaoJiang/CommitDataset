HTTP/2 to HTTP/1.x headers conversion more accessible

Motivation:
Currently there is a HttpConversionUtil.addHttp2ToHttpHeaders which requires a FullHttpMessage, but this may not always be available. There is no interface that can be used with just Http2Headers and HttpHeaders.

Modifications:
- add an overload for HttpConversionUtil.addHttp2ToHttpHeaders which does not take FullHttpMessage

Result:
An overload for HttpConversionUtil.addHttp2ToHttpHeaders exists which does not require FullHttpMessage.
