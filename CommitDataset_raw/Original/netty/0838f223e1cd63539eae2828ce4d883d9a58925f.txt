Decouple AbstractChannel and AbstractChannelHandlerContext

Motivation:

We do a "blind" cast to AbstractChannel in AbstractChannelHandlerContext which we should better no do. It would be better to decouble AbstractChannelHandlerContext from AbstractChannel.

Modifications:

Decouble AbstractChannelHandlerContext from AbstractChannel by move logic to DefaultChannelPipeline

Result:

Less coubling and less casting.
