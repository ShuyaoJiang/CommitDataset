Add *UnsafeHeapByteBuf for improve performance on systems with sun.misc.Unsafe

Motivation:

sun.misc.Unsafe allows us to handle heap ByteBuf in a more efficient matter. We should use special ByteBuf implementation when sun.misc.Unsafe can be used to increase performance.

Modifications:

- Add PooledUnsafeHeapByteBuf and UnpooledUnsafeHeapByteBuf that are used when sun.misc.Unsafe is ready to use.
- Add UnsafeHeapSwappedByteBuf

Result:

Better performance when using heap buffers and sun.misc.Unsafe is ready to use.
