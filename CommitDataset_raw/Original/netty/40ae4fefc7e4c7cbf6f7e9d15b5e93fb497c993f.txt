Introduce an alternative IdentityCipherSuiteFilter that defaults to supportedCiphers, close #7655

Motivation:

Sometimes, it would be convenient to be able to easily enable all
supported cipher suites, regardless of security.

Currently, the only way it to retrieve all supported ciphers and pass
them explicitly.

Modification:

Introduce a new IdentityCipherSuiteFilter singleton that defaults to
supportedCiphers instead of defaultCiphers when ciphers are null.

Result:

Convenient way to enabled all supported cipher suites.
