[#4754] Correctly detect websocket upgrade

Motivation:

If the Connection header contains multiple values (which is valid) we fail to detect a websocket upgrade

Modification:

- Add new method which allows to check if a header field contains a specific value (and also respect multiple header values)
- Use this method to detect handshake

Result:

Correct detect handshake if Connection header contains multiple values (seperated by ',').
