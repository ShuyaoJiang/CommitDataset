Skip osgi testsuite on JDK11. (#8733)

Since the updating to OpenJDK 11.0.2 the OSGI testsuite fails. We should dissable it until there is a version of the used plugins that works with this OpenJDK version.

Modifications:

Skip osgi testsuite when using JDK11.

Result:

Build pass again with JDK11.
