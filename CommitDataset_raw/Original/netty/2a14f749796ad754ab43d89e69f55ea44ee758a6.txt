Ensure all methods are correctly override in *LeakAware*ByteBuf implementations

Motivation:

We missed to override a few methods and so some actions on the ByteBuf failed.

Modifications:

- Override all methods
- Add unit tests to ensure all is fixed.

Result:

All *LeakAware*ByteBuf have correct implementations
