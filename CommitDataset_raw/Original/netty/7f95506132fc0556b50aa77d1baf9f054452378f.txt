Don't send a RST on close of the stream may not have existed (#8086)

Motivation:

When a Http2MultiplexCodec stream channel fails to write the first
HEADERS it will forcibly close, and that will trigger sending a
RST_STREAM, which is commonly a connection level protocol error. This is
because it has what looks like a valid stream id, but didn't check with
the connection as to whether the stream may have actually existed.

Modifications:

Instead of checking if the stream was just a valid looking id ( > 0) we
check with the connection as to whether it may have existed at all.

Result:

We no longer send a RST_STREAM frame from Http2MultiplexCodec for idle
streams.
