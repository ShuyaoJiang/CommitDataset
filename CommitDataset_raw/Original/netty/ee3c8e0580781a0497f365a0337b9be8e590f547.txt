Test that CompositeByteBuf releases its components

Motivation:

In order to prevent a regression, add test case for a bug that caused a CompositeByteBuf to not release its components.

Modifications:

Add a test case that asserts a CompositeByteBuf's component buffers have indeed been released.

Result:

AbstractCompositeByteBuf gains a test case that will prevent future regressions.
