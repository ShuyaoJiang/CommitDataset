Clear selectedKeys in OioSctpChannel.doReadMessages

Motivation:
The fix for https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/3884 breaks SctpEchoTest because Selector.select will always return 0 if you do not clear last selectedKeys.

Modifications:
Clear readSelector.selectedKeys() if it is not empty.

Result:
SctpEchoTest is green again.
