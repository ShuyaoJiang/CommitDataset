Do proper bounds-checking in HpackHuffmanDecoder to reduce overhead of IndexOutOfBoundsException creation

Motivation:

HpackHuffmanDecoder.Decoder did not do any bound-checking but just catched IndexOutOfBoundsException to detect if the array needs to grow. This can be very expensive because of fillInStackTrace()

Modifications:

Add proper bounds checking and grow the array if needed without catching IndexOutOfBoundsException.

Result:

Less overhead if the array needs to grow.
