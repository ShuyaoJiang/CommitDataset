Make DnsAddressResolverGroup easier to extend

Motivation:

DnsAddressResolverGroup allows to override the newResolver(...) method to change the settings used by the user. We should better let the user override another method and always apply the InflightNameResolver.

Modifications:

- Mark newResolver(...) method as deprecated, we will make it private soon.
- Add newNameResolver(...) method that user can override.

Result:

Easier to extend DnsAddressResolverGroup
