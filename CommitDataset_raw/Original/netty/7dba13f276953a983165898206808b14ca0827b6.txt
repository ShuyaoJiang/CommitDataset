HttpConversionUtil remove throws from method signature

Motivation:
HttpConversionUtil.toHttp2Headers currently has a throws Exception as part of the signature. This comes from the signature of ByteProcessor.process, but is not necessary because the ByteProcessor used does not throw.

Modifications:
- Remove throws Exception from the signature of HttpConversionUtil.toHttp2Headers.

Result:
HttpConversionUtil.toHttp2Headers interface does not propagate a throws Exception when it is used.
