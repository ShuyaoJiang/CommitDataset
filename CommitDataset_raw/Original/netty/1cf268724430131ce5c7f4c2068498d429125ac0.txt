Fixed JMH ByteBuf benchmark to avoid dead code elimination

Motivation:

The JMH doc suggests to use BlackHoles to avoid dead code elimination hence would be better to follow this best practice.

Modifications:

Each benchmark method is returning the ByteBuf/ByteBuffer to avoid the JVM to perform any dead code elimination.

Result:

The results are more reliable and comparable to the others provided by other ByteBuf benchmarks (eg HeapByteBufBenchmark)
