Implement OpenSSL Engine tests for NPN / ALPN.
Motivation:

Currently there are no tests for OpenSSL Engine,
only for JdkSSL engine.

Modifications:

Common methods from `JdkSslEngine` test moved
to `SSLEngineTest`, JdkSslEngine now implements
NPN and ALPN tests.

Result:

OpenSSL Engine is now covered with unit tests.
