Allow to delay registration when creating a EmbeddedChannel

Motivation:

Some ChannelOptions must be set before the Channel is really registered to have the desired effect.

Modifications:

Add another constructor argument which allows to not register the EmbeddedChannel to its EventLoop until the user calls register().

Result:

More flexible usage of EmbeddedChannel. Also Fixes [#6968].
