Fix failing h2spec tests 8.1.2.1 related to pseudo-headers validation

Motivation:

According to the spec:
All pseudo-header fields MUST appear in the header block before regular
header fields. Any request or response that contains a pseudo-header
field that appears in a header block after
a regular header field MUST be treated as malformed (Section 8.1.2.6).

Pseudo-header fields are only valid in the context in which they are defined.
Pseudo-header fields defined for requests MUST NOT appear in responses;
pseudo-header fields defined for responses MUST NOT appear in requests.
Pseudo-header fields MUST NOT appear in trailers.
Endpoints MUST treat a request or response that contains undefined or
invalid pseudo-header fields as malformed (Section 8.1.2.6).

Clients MUST NOT accept a malformed response. Note that these requirements
are intended to protect against several types of common attacks against HTTP;
they are deliberately strict because being permissive can expose
implementations to these vulnerabilities.

Modifications:

- Introduce validation in HPackDecoder

Result:

- Requests with unknown pseudo-field headers are rejected
- Requests with containing response specific pseudo-headers are rejected
- Requests where pseudo-header appear after regular header are rejected
- h2spec 8.1.2.1 pass
