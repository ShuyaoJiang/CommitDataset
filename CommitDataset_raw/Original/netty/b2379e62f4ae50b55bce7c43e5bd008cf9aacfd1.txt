Allow customization of LocalChannel instances that are being created by LocalServerChannel.

Motivation

It's possible to extend LocalChannel as well as LocalServerChannel but the LocalServerChannel's serve(peer) method is hardcoded to create only instances of LocalChannel.

Modifications

Add a protected factory method that returns by default new LocalChannel(...) but users may override it to customize it.

Result

It's possible to customize the LocalChannel instance on either end of the virtual connection.
