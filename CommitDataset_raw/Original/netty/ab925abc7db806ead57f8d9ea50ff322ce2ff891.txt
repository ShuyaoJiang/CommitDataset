Ignore frames for streams that may have previously existed.

Motivation:

The recent PR that discarded the Http2StreamRemovalPolicy causes connection errors when receiving a frame for a stream that no longer exists. We should ignore these frames if we think there's a chance that the stream has existed previously

Modifications:

Modified the Http2Connection interface to provide a `streamMayHaveExisted` method. Also removed the requireStream() method to identify all of the places in the code that need to be updated.

Modified the encoder and decoder to properly handle cases where a stream may have existed but no longer does.

Result:

Fixes #3643
