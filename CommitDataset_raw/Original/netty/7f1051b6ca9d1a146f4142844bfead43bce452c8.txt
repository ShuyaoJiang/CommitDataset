Include JNIEXPORT on exported symbols

Motivation:
As noticed in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45700277/
compilation can fail if the definition of a method doesn't
match the declaration.  It's easy enough to add this in, and make
it easy to compile.

Modifications:
Add JNIEXPORT to the entry points.

* On Windows this adds: `__declspec(dllexport)`
* On Mac this adds: `__attribute__((visibility("default")))`
* On Linux (GCC 4.2+) this adds: ` __attribute__((visibility("default")))`
* On other it doesn't add anything.

Result:
Easier compilation
