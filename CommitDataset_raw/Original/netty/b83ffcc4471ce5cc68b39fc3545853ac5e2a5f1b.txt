Add timeout to PooledByteBufAllocatorTest

Motivation:

Some tests in PooledByteBufAllocatorTest are blocking on a CountDownLatch. We should use a timeout on these tests so these will not block forever on a failure.

Modifications:

Add timeout param to @Test annotation

Result:

Have sane timeouts on tests.
