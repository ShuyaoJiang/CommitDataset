Allow to create Unsafe ByteBuf implementations that not use a Cleaner to clean the native memory.

Motivation:

Using the Cleaner to release the native memory has a few drawbacks:

- Cleaner.clean() uses static synchronized internally which means it can be a performance bottleneck
- It put more load on the GC

Modifications:

Add new buffer implementations that can be enabled with a system flag as optimizations. In this case no Cleaner is used at all and the user must ensure everything is always released.

Result:

Less performance impact by direct buffers when need to be allocated and released.
