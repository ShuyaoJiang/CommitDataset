Convert X509TrustManager into X509ExtendedTrustManager for Java 7+

Motivation:

Since Java 7, X509TrustManager implementation is wrapped by a JDK class
called AbstractTrustManagerWrapper, which performs an additional
certificate validation for Socket or SSLEngine-backed connections.

This makes the TrustManager implementations provided by
InsecureTrustManagerFactory and FingerprintTrustManagerFactory not
insecure enough, where their certificate validation fails even when it
should pass.

Modifications:

- Add X509TrustManagerWrapper which adapts an X509TrustManager into an
  X509ExtendedTrustManager
- Make SimpleTrustManagerFactory wrap an X509TrustManager with
  X509TrustManagerWrapper is the provided TrustManager does not extend
  X509ExtendedTrustManager

Result:

- InsecureTrustManagerFactory and FingerprintTrustManagerFactory are now
  insecure as expected.
- Fixes #5910
