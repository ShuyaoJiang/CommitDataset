[#4449] Remove registered events from eventloop before close

Motivation:

We need to remove all registered events for a Channel from the EventLoop before doing the actual close to ensure we not produce a cpu spin when the actual close operation is delayed or executed outside of the EventLoop.

Modifications:

Deregister for events for NIO and EPOLL socket implementations when SO_LINGER is used.

Result:

No more cpu spin.
