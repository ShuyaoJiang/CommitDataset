Fix SocketException in NioSocketChannelUnsafe.closeExecutor()

Related: #3464

Motivation:

When a connection attempt is failed,
NioSocketChannelUnsafe.closeExecutor() triggers a SocketException,
suppressing the channelUnregistered() event.

Modification:

Do not attempt to get SO_LINGER value when a socket is not open yet.

Result:

One less bug
