Adding int-to-object map implementation.

Motivation:

Maps with integer keys are used in several places (HTTP/2 code, for
example). To reduce the memory footprint of these structures, we need a
specialized map class that uses ints as keys.

Modifications:

Added IntObjectHashMap, which is uses open addressing and double hashing
for collision resolution.

Result:

A new int-based map class that can be shared across Netty.
