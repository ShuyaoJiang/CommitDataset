Fix class references of its subclass issue

Motivation:

Realization of `AbstractTrafficShapingHandler.userDefinedWritabilityIndex()` has references to subclasses.
In addition, one of the subclasses overriding it, but the other does not.

Modifications:

Add overriding to the second subclass. Remove references to subclasses from parent class.

Result:

More consistent and clean code (OOP-stylish).
