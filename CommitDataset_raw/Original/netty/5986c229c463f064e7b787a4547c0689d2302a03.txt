[#5833] Ensure direct memory is released when DirectPoolArena is collected

Motivation:

We need to ensure we release all direct memory once the DirectPoolArena is collected. Otherwise we may never reclaim the memory and so leak memory.

Modifications:

Ensure we destroy all PoolChunk memory when DirectPoolArena is collected.

Result:

Free up unreleased memory when DirectPoolArena is collected.
