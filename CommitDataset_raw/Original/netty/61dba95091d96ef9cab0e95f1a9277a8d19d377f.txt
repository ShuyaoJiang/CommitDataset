Fix h2spec test 4.3 about invalid header block

Motivation:

HPackDecoder works on entire header block, we shouldn't encounter
incomplete header fields. If we do we should treat it as
a decoding error and according to the specification:

A decoding error in a header block MUST be treated as
a connection error (Section 5.4.1) of type COMPRESSION_ERROR.

Modifications:

* Check final state in HpackDecoder once we've decoded all the data.

Result:

* Throw a connection error if we receive incomplete header fields
* H2spec 4.3 tests all passes
