Cleanup SslHandler handshake/renegotiation (#8555)

Motivation:

The code for initiating a TLS handshake or renegotiation process is
currently difficult to reason about.

Modifications:

This commit introduces to clear paths for starting a handshake. The
first path is a normal handshake. The handshake is started and a timeout
is scheduled.

The second path is renegotiation. If the first handshake is incomplete,
the renegotiation promise is added as a listener to the handshake
promise. Otherwise, the renegotiation promise replaces the original
promsie. At that point the handshake is started again and a timeout is
scheduled.

Result:

Cleaner and easier to understand code.
