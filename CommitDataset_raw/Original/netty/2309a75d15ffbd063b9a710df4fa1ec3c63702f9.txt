Add proxy support for client socket connections

Related issue: #1133

Motivation:

There is no support for client socket connections via a proxy server in
Netty.

Modifications:

- Add a new module 'handler-proxy'
- Add ProxyHandler and its subclasses to support SOCKS 4a/5 and HTTP(S)
  proxy connections
- Add a full parameterized test for most scenarios
- Clean up pom.xml

Result:

A user can make an outgoing connection via proxy servers with only
trivial effort.
