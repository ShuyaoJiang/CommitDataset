DefaultPromise internal state dependent on Signal

Motivation:
DefaultPromise's internal state depends upon specific Signal objects. These Signal objects can be used externally which causes the DefaultPromise object API to not function correct and state to become corrupted.

Modifications:
- DefaultPromise shouldn't depend upon Signal for its internal state

Result:
Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/7707
