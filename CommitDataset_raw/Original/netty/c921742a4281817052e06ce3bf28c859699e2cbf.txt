Dont fire an SslHandshakeEvent if the handshake was not started at all.

Motivation:

We should not fire a SslHandshakeEvent if the channel is closed but the handshake was not started.

Modifications:

- Add a variable to SslHandler which tracks if an handshake was started yet or not and depending on this fire the event.
- Add a unit test

Result:

Fixes [#7262].
