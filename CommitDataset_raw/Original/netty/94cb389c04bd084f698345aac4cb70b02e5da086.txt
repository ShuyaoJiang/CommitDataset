Restore add(Promise) and addAll(Promise...) methods to PromiseCombiner.

Motivation:

A testing goof in 7c630fe introduced a binary incompatibility when the old Promise-specific `add` and `addAll` methods in PromiseCombiner were generalized to accept `Futures`.

Modification:

- Restore (but mark as `@Deprecated`) old PromiseCombiner methods.
- Fixed a couple minor documentation typos because sure why not.

Result:

`PromiseCombiner` is binary-compatible with previous versions of Netty.
