transport-native-kqueue libraries should not lazy link

Motivation:
We rely upon the linker being non-lazy to test compatibility the native library compatibility for kqueue, but the default mode of operation is to lazy link.

Modifications:
- We should modify the build scripts to inform the linker that this library should not be lazy linked
- Error messages changes
dyld: lazy symbol binding failed: Symbol not found: _clock_gettime

java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: unsupported JNI version 0xFFFFFFFF required by .../libnetty-transport-native-kqueue.dylib

Result:
Link errors are detected upon library load time.
