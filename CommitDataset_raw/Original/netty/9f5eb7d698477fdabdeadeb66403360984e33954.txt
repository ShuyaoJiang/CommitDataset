Add CharSequence operations to ByteBuf

Motivation:

Often users either need to read or write CharSequences to a ByteBuf. We should add methods for this to ByteBuf as we can do some optimizations for this depending on the implementation.

Modifications:

Add setCharSequence, writeCharSequence, getCharSequence and readCharSequence

Result:

Easier reading / writing of CharSequence with ByteBuf.
