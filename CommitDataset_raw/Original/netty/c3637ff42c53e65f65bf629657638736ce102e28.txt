AUTO_CLOSE should not be marked as deprecated. (#7967)

Motivation:

A long time ago we deprecated AUTO_CLOSE but it turned out this feature is still useful because if a write error is detected there still maybe data to read, and if we close the channel automatically we will lose data

Modifications:

- Remove `@Deprecated` tag for AUTO_CLOSE, setAutoClose(...) and isAutoClose(...)
- Fix javadocs on ChannelConfig to correctly tell the default value of AUTO_CLOSE.

Result:

Less warnings.
