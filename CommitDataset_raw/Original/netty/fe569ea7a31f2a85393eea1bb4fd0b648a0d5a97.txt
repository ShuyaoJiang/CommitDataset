Fix for a newly intrduced bug in #5377

Motivation

This bug was introduced with #5377 and affects only users who'd like to share/cache/re-use `PemPrivateKey` and `PemX509Certificate` instances.

Modifications

Use `ByteBuf#writeBytes(src, readerIndex, length)` so that the src's readerIndex doesn't change and can consequently be used more than once.

Result

It's possible to share/cache/re-use `PemPrivateKey` and `PemX509Certificate` instances as long as their refCnt remains >= 1.
