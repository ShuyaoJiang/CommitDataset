Ensure the same ByteBufAllocator is used in the EmbeddedChannel when compress / decompress. Related to [#5294]

Motivation:

The user may specify to use a different allocator then the default. In this case we need to ensure it is shared when creating the EmbeddedChannel inside of a ChannelHandler

Modifications:

Use the config of the "original" Channel in the EmbeddedChannel and so share the same allocator etc.

Result:

Same type of buffers are used.
