Fixes NPE in Corshandler for unauthorized prefligt requests (#7865)

Motivation:
NPE in `CorsHandler` if a pre-flight request is done using an Origin header which is not allowed by any `CorsConfig` passed to the handler on creation.

Modifications:
During the pre-flight, check the `CorsConfig` for `null` and handle it correctly by not returning any access-control header

Result:
No more NPE for pre-flight requests with unauthorized origins.
