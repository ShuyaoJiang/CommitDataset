HttpConversionUtils avoid intermediate collection allocation

Modifications:
HttpConversionUtil#toLowercaseMap requires an intermediate List to be allocated. This can be avoided with the recently added value iterator methods.

Modifications:
- Use HttpHeaders#valueCharSequenceIterator instead of getAll

Result:
Less intermediate object allocation and copying.
