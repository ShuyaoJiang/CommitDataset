Http2 to Http1.1 converter on new Http2 server API

Motivation:

http/2 and http/1.1 have similar protocols, and it's useful to be able
to implement a single server against a single interface. There's an
injection from http/1.1 messages to http/2 ones, so it makes sense to
make folks program against http/1.1 and upgrade them under the hood.

Modifications:

added a MessageToMessageCodec<Http2StreamFrame, HttpObject> which turns
every kind of Http2StreamFrame domain object into an HttpObject domain
object, and then back again on the way out.  This one is specialized for
servers, but it should be straightforward to make a symmetric one for
clients, or else extend this one.

Result:

fixes #5199, and it's now simple to make your Http2MultiplexCodec speak
Http1.1
