We should call the UnLoad methods when we detect an error during calling OnLoad (#8237)

Motivation:

We should ensure we call *UnLoad when we detect an error during calling *OnLoad and previous *OnLoad calls were succesfull.

Modifications:

Correctly call *UnLoad when needed.

Result:

More correct code and no leaks when an error happens during loading the native lib.
