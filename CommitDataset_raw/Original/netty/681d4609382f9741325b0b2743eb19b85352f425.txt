Introduce TextHeaders and AsciiString

Motivation:

We have quite a bit of code duplication between HTTP/1, HTTP/2, SPDY,
and STOMP codec, because they all have a notion of 'headers', which is a
multimap of string names and values.

Modifications:

- Add TextHeaders and its default implementation
- Add AsciiString to replace HttpHeaderEntity
  - Borrowed some portion from Apache Harmony's java.lang.String.
- Reimplement HttpHeaders, SpdyHeaders, and StompHeaders using
  TextHeaders
- Add AsciiHeadersEncoder to reuse the encoding a TextHeaders
  - Used a dedicated encoder for HTTP headers for better performance
    though
- Remove shortcut methods in SpdyHeaders
- Replace SpdyHeaders.getStatus() with HttpResponseStatus.parseLine()

Result:

- Removed quite a bit of code duplication in the header implementations.
- Slightly better performance thanks to improved header validation and
  hash code calculation
