HTTP/2 ConnectionHandler close cleanup

Motiviation:
The connection handler stream close operation is unconditionally adding a listener object to a future. We may not have to add a listener at all because the future has already been completed.

Modifications:
- If the future is done, directly invoke the logic without creating/adding a new listener.

Result:
No need to create/add listener if the future is already done in close logic.
