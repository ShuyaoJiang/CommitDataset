Always follow cnames even if a matching A or AAAA record was found. (#7919)

Motivation:

At the moment if you do a resolveAll and at least one A / AAAA record is present we will not follow any CNAMEs that are also present. This is different to how the JDK behaves.

Modifications:

- Allows follow CNAMEs.
- Add unit test.

Result:

Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/7915.
