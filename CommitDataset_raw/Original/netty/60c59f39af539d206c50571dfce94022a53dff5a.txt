Use CoalescingBufferQueue to merge data writes on a stream in HTTP2 instead of CompositeByteBuf

Motivation:

Slicing a mutable CompositeByteBuf is not the appropriate mechanism to use to track and release buffers that have been written to a channel.
In particular buffers passed over an Embedded or LocalChannel are retained after the ChannelPromise is completed and listening to the
promise to consolidate a CompositeBuffer breaks slices taken from the composite as the offset indices have changed.

In addition CoalescingBufferQueue handles taking arbitrarily sized slices of a sequence of buffers more efficiently.

Modifications:

Convert FlowControlledData to use a CoalescingBufferQueue to handle merging data writes.

Result:

HTTP2 works over LocalChannel and code is considerably simpler.
