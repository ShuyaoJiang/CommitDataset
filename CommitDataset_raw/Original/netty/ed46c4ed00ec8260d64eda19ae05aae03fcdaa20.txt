Copies from read-only heap ByteBuffer to direct ByteBuf can avoid stealth ByteBuf allocation and additional copies

Motivation:

Read-only heap ByteBuffer doesn't expose array: the existent method to perform copies to direct ByteBuf involves the creation of a (maybe pooled) additional heap ByteBuf instance and copy

Modifications:

To avoid stressing the allocator with additional (and stealth) heap ByteBuf allocations is provided a method to perform copies using the (pooled) internal NIO buffer

Result:

Copies from read-only heap ByteBuffer to direct ByteBuf won't create any intermediate ByteBuf
