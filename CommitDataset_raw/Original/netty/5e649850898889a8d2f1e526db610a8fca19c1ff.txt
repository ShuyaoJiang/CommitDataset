Add support for KeyManagerFactory when using SslProvider.OpenSsl.

Motivation:

To be able to use SslProvider.OpenSsl with existing java apps that use the JDK SSL API we need to also provide a way to use it with an existing KeyManagerFactory.

Modification:

Make use of new tcnative apis and so hook in KeyManagerFactory.

Result:

SslProvider.OpenSsl can be used with KeyManagerFactory as well.
