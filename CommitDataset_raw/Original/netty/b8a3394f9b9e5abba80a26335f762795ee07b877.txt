Adding an execute burst cost benchmark for Netty executors (#8594)

Motivation:

Netty executors doesn't have yet any means to compare with each others
nor to compare with the j.u.c. executors

Modifications:

A new benchmark measuring execute burst cost is being added

Result:

It's now possible to compare some of Netty executors with each others
and with the j.u.c. executors
