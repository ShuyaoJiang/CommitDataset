Optimize space usage of FastThreadLocal (#7861)

Motivation:
A FastThreadLocal instance currently occupies 2 slots of InternalThreadLocalMap of every thread. Actually for a FastThreadLocalThread, it does not need to store cleaner flags of FastThreadLocal instances. Besides, using BitSet to store cleaner flags is also better for space usage.

Modification:
Use BitSet to optimize space usage of FastThreadLocal.

Result:
Avoid unnecessary slot occupancy. Cleaner flags are now stored into a BitSet.
