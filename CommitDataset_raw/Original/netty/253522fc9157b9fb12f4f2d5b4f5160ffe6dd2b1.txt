Create SimpleUserEventChannelHandler convenience class (#7991)

Motivation:

Currently, the vast majority of userEventTriggered() implementations
require the user to supply the boilerplate behavior of performing an
instanceof check, handling if appropriate, and calling
fireUserEventTriggered() otherwise.

We can simplify this very common use case by creating a class that only
matches user events of a given type, similar to the existing
SimpleChannelInboundHandler class.

Modifications:

Create a new SimpleUserEventChannelHandler class
Create accompanying SimpleUserEventChannelHandlerTest class

Result:

Users will be able to handle most events in a less verbose manner.
