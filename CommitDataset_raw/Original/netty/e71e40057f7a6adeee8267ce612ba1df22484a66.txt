Fix possible IllegalStateException caused by closeNotifyTimeout when using SslHandler

Motivation:

In the SslHandler we schedule a timeout at which we close the Channel if a timeout was detected during close_notify. Because this can race with notify the flushFuture we can see an IllegalStateException when the Channel is closed.

Modifications:

- Use a trySuccess() and tryFailure(...) to guard against race.

Result:

No more race.
