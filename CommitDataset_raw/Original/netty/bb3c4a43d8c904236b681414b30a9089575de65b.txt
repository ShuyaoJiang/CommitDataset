Lz4FrameDecoder should reduce memory copies whenever possible

Motivation:

When the user constructs Lz4FrameDecoder with a Checksum implementation like CRC32 or Adler32 and uses Java8 we can directly use a ByteBuffer to do the checksum work. This way we can eliminate memory copies.

Modifications:

Detect if ByteBuffer can be used for checksum work and if so reduce memory copies.

Result:

Less memory copies when using JDK8
