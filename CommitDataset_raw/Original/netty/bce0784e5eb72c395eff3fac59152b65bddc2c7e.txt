Fix racy ChannelOutboundBuffer.testWriteTaskRejected test. (#8735)

Motivation:

testWriteTaskRejected was racy as we did not ensure we dispatched all events to the executor before shutting it down.

Modifications:

Add a latch to ensure we dispatched everything.

Result:

Fix racy test that failed sometimes before.
