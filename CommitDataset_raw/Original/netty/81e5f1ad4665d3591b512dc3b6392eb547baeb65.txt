[#2589] LocalServerChannel.doClose() throws NPE when localAddress == null

Motivation:

LocalServerChannel.doClose() calls LocalChannelRegistry.unregister(localAddress); without check if localAddress is null and so produce a NPE when pass null the used ConcurrentHashMapV8

Modification:
Check for localAddress != null before try to remove it from Map. Also added a unit test which showed the stacktrace of the error.

Result:

No more NPE during doClose().
