Add unit test for HttpObjectDecoder with message split on buffer boundaries

Motivation:
We should have a unit test which explicitly tests a HTTP message being split between multiple ByteBuf objects.

Modifications:
- Add a unit test to HttpRequestDecoderTest which splits a request between 2 ByteBuf objects

Result:
More unit test coverage for HttpObjectDecoder.
