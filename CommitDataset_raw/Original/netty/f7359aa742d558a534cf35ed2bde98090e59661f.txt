Use SSL.setKeyMaterial(...) to test if the KeyManagerFactory is supported (#8985)

Motivation:

We use SSL.setKeyMaterial(...) in our implementation when using the KeyManagerFactory so we should also use it to detect if we can support KeyManagerFactory.

Modifications:

Use SSL.setKeyMaterial(...) as replacement for SSL.setCertificateBio(...)

Result:

Use the same method call to detect if KeyManagerFactory can be supported as we use in the real implementation.
