Prevent NPE when attempting to set client key material with no alias (#8378)

Motivation:

It is possible that a client is unable to locate a certificate alias given the list of issuers and key types. In this case the X509KeyManager
will return a null which when past to the OpenSslKeyMaterialProvider implementation may produce a NPE. If no matching alias could be found we should not
call OpenSslKeyMaterialProvider at all which is also consistent what OpenJDK does.

Modifications:

- Add null check before calling OpenSslKeyMaterialProvider
- Add unit test.

Result:

No more NPE caused by passing null as client alias.
