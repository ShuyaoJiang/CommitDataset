Raise a meaningful exception instead of NPE

Motivation:

When decoding the NAME field in a DNS Resource Record, DnsResponseDecoder
can raise a NullPointerException if the NAME field contains a loop.

Modification:

Instead of raising an NPE, raise CorruptedFrameException so that the
exception itself has meaning.

Result:

Less confusing when a malformed DNS RR is received
