Ensure EpollSocketChannel.localAddress() returns correct address after connect(...) call.

Motivation:

We missed to correctly retrieve the localAddress() after we called Socket.connect(..) and so the user would always see an incorrect address when calling EpollSocketChannel.localAddress().

Modifications:

- Ensure we always retrieve the localAddress() after we called Socket.connect(...) as only after this we will be able to receive the correct address.
- Add unit test

Result:

Correct and consistent behaviour across different transports (NIO/OIO/EPOLL).
