Do not log on explicit no unsafe again

Motivation:

Users should not see a scary log message when Netty is initialized if
Netty configuration explicitly disables unsafe. The log message that
produces this warning was previously guarded but the guard was
lost.

Modifications:

This commit brings back the guard against the scary log message if
unsafe is explicitly disabled.

Result:

No log message is produced when unsafe is unavailable because Netty was
told to not look for it.
