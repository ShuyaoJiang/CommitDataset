Allow to run tests with extra commandline arguments

Motivation:

Often its useful to run the tests with different commandline arguments (like different system properties).

Modifications:

Introduce argLine.javaProperties which can be set from the commandline as well to add arguments that should be append when run the unit tests.

Result:

More flexible way to run the tests.
