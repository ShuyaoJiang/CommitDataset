Set Recycler DEFAULT_INITIAL_MAX_CAPACITY to a more sane value

Motivation:

We used a very high number for DEFAULT_INITIAL_MAX_CAPACITY (over 200k) which is not very relastic and my lead to very surprising memory usage if allocations happen in bursts.

Modifications:

Use a more sane default value of 32k

Result:

Less possible memory usage by default
