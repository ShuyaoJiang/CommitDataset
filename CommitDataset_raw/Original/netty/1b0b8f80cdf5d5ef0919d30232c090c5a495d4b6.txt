AbstractScheduledEventExecutor.schedule(...) must accept delay <= 0.

Motivation:

As the javadoc of ScheduledExecutorService state:

Zero and negative delays (but not periods) are also allowed in schedule methods,and are treated as requests for immediate execution.

Modifications:

- Correctly handle delay <= 0.
- Add unit tests.

Result:

Fixes [#6627].
