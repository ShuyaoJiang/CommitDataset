Add SslCloseCompletionEvent that is fired once a close_notify was received

Motivation:

For the completion of a handshake we already fire a SslHandshakeCompletionEvent which the user can intercept. We should do the same for the receiving of close_notify.

Modifications:

Add SslCloseCompletionEvent and test-case.

Result:

More consistent API.
