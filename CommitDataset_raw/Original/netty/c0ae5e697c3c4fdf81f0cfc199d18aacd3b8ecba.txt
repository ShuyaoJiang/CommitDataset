DnsAddressResolverGroup to use pluggable DnsNameResolverBuilder (#7793)

Motivation:

Right now to customize DNS name resolver when using DnsAddressResolverGroup
one should subclass implementation and override newNameResolver method when
in fact it's possible to collect all settings in a DnsNameResolverBuilder
instance. Described in #7749.

Modifications:

- Added new constructor for DnsNameResolverBuilder in order to delay
  EventLoop specification

- Added copy() method to DnsNameResolverBuilder to provide an immutable
  copy of the builder

- Added new single-argument constructor for DnsAddressResolverGroup and
  RoundRobinDnsAddressResolverGroup accepting DnsNameResolverBuilder
  instance

- DnsAddressResolverGroup to build a new resolver using DnsNameResolverBuilder
  given instead of creating a new one

- Test cases to check that changing channelFactory after the builder was passed
  to create a DnsNameResolverGroup would not propagate to the name resolver

Result:

Much easier to customize DNS settings w/o subclassing DnsAddressResolverGroup
