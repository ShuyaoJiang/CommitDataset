Mark transport udt as deprecated as barchart-udt is not maintained anymore

Motivation:

barchart-udt is not maintained anymore so there is not way for us to get fixes for udt. Because of this we should mark the transport as deprecated.

Modifications:

Deprecate all udt classes.

Result:

transport udt is deprecated and so the user knows it will be removed in the future.
