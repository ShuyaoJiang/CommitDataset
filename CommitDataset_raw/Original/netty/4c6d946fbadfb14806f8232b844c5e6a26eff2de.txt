KQueueSocket#setTrafficClass exceptions

Motivation:
MacOS will throw an error when attempting to set the IP_TOS socket option if IPv6 is available, and also when getting the value for IP_TOS.

Modifications:
- Socket#setTrafficClass and Socket#getTrafficClass should try to use IPv6 first, and check if the error code indicates the protocol is not supported before trying IPv4

Result:
Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/6741.
