Include more detail why Unsafe is not available

Motivation:
PD and PD0 Both try to find and use Unsafe.  If unavailable, they
try to log why and continue on.  However, it is not always east to
enable this logging.  Chaining exceptions together is much easier
to reach, and the original exception is relevant when Unsafe is
needed.

Modifications:
* Make PD log why PD0 could not be loaded with a trace level log
* Make PD0 remember why Unsafe wasn't available
* Expose unavailability cause through PD for higher level use.
* Make Epoll and KQueue include the reason when failing

Result:
Easier debugging in hard to reconfigure environments
