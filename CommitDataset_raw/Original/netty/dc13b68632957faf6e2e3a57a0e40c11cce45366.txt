Make sure ChannelHandler.handlerRemoved() is always invoked

- Fixes #1366: No elegant way to free non-in/outbound buffers held by a handler
- handlerRemoved() is now also invoked when a channel is deregistered, as well as when a handler is removed from a pipeline.
- A little bit of clean-up for readability
- Fix a bug in forwardBufferContentAndRemove() where the handler buffers are not freed (mainly because we were relying on channel.isRegistered() to determine if the handler has been removed from inside the handler.
- ChunkedWriteHandler.handlerRemoved() is unnecessary anymore because ChannelPipeline now always forwards the content of the buffer.
