Added DuplicatedAbstractByteBuf that can provide fast-path for _get* and _set* methods

Motivation:

DuplicatedByteBuf can be used for any ByteBuf implementations and so can not do any optimizations that could be done
when AbstractByteBuf is duplicated.

Modifications:

- Add DuplicatedAbstractByteBuf that can eliminate range and reference count checks for _get* and _set* methods.

Result:

Faster DuplicatedByteBuf implementations for AbstractByteBuf sub-classes.
