h2childchan: Ability to open outbound/local streams. Fixes #4913

Motivation:

The HTTP/2 child channel API does not allow to create local/outbound HTTP/2 streams.

Modifications:

Add a Http2StreamChannelBootstrap that allows to create outbound streams.

Result:

The HTTP/2 child channel API now supports outbound streams.
