Add benchmark for HeapByteBuf implementations.

Motivation:

To prove one implementation is faster as the other we should have a benchmark.

Modifications:

Add benchmark which benchmarks the unsafe and non-unsafe implementation of HeapByteBuf.

Result:

Able to compare speed of implementations easily.
