AbstractHttp2ConnectionHandlerBuilder support for HPACK huffman decoder initial size

Motivation:
Depending on the use case it may make sense to increase or decrease the initial size of the buffer used during the HPACK huffman decode process. This is currently not exposed through the AbstractHttp2ConnectionHandlerBuilder.

Modifications:
- Add a method to AbstractHttp2ConnectionHandlerBuilder which allows the initial size of the buffer used during the HPACK huffman decode prcoess to be configured.

Result:
AbstractHttp2ConnectionHandlerBuilder provides more control of codec-http2 knobs.
