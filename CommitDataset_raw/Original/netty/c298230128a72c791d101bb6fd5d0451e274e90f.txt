RFC6265 cookies support

Motivation:

Currently Netty supports a weird implementation of RFC 2965.
First, this RFC has been deprecated by RFC 6265 and nobody on the
internet use this format.

Then, there's a confusion between client side and server side encoding
and decoding.

Typically, clients should only send name=value pairs.

This PR introduces RFC 6265 support, but keeps on supporting RFC 2965 in
the sense that old unused fields are simply ignored, and Cookie fields
won't be populated. Deprecated fields are comment, commentUrl, version,
discard and ports.

It also provides a mechanism for safe server-client-server roundtrip, as
User-Agents are not supposed to interpret cookie values but return them
as-is (e.g. if Set-Cookie contained a quoted value, it should be sent
back in the Cookie header in quoted form too).

Also, there are performance gains to be obtained by not allocating the
attribute name Strings, as we only want to match them to find which POJO
field to populate.

Modifications:

- New RFC6265ClientCookieEncoder/Decoder and
  RFC6265ServerCookieEncoder/Decoder pairs that live alongside old
  CookieEncoder/Decoder pair to not break backward compatibility.
- New Cookie.rawValue field, used for lossless server-client-server
  roundtrip.

Result:

RFC 6265 support.
Clean separation of client and server side.

Decoder performance gain:
