Refactor integration tests of compression codecs

Motivation:

Duplicated code of integration tests for different compression codecs.

Modifications:

- Added abstract class IntegrationTest which contains common tests for any compression codec.
- Removed common tests from Bzip2IntegrationTest and LzfIntegrationTest.
- Implemented abstract methods of IntegrationTest in Bzip2IntegrationTest, LzfIntegrationTest and SnappyIntegrationTest.

Result:

Removed duplicated code of integration tests for compression codecs and simplified an addition of integration tests for new compression codecs.
