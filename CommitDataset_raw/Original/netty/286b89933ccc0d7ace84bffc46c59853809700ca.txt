Allow to obtain RecvByteBufAllocator.Handle to allow more flexible implementations

Motivation:

At the moment it's only possible for a user to set the RecvByteBufAllocator for a Channel but not access the Handle once it is assigned. This makes it hard to write more flexible implementations.

Modifications:

Add a new method to the Channel.Unsafe to allow access the the used Handle for the Channel. The RecvByteBufAllocator.Handle is created lazily.

Result:

It's possible to write more flexible implementatons that allow to adjust stuff on the fly for a Handle that is used by a Channel
