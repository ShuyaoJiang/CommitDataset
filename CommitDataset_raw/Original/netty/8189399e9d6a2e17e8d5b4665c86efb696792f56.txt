Ignore EINTR on close(...) as there is nothing sane we can do.

Motivation:

If close(...) reports EINTR there is nothing sane we can do so it makes no sense to even report it. See also:

https://github.com/apple/swift-nio/pull/217

Modifications:

Just ignore EINTR when calling close(...)

Result:

Less noise in the logs.
