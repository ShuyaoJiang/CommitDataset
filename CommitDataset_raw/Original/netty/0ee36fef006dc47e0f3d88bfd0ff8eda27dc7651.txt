Accept two ways to start HTTP/2 over clear text

Motivation:

HTTP/2 support two ways to start on a no-tls tcp connection,
http/1.1 upgrade and prior knowlege methodology to start HTTP/2.
Currently, the http2-server from example only support
starting by upgrade. I think we can do a simple dispatch by peek first
bytes from inbound that match to prior knowledge preface or not and
determine which handlers to set into pipeline.

Modifications:

Add ClearTextHttp2ServerUpgradeHandler to support start HTTP/2 via clear
text with two approach. And update example/http2-server to support
this functionality.

Result:

netty HTTP/2 and the example http2-server accept for two ways to start
HTTP/2 over clear text.
