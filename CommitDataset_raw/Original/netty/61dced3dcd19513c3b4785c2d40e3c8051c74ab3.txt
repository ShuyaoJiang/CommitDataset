Proposal to fix issue #3768 (3.10)

Motivations:
When using HttpPostRequestEncoder and trying to set an attribute if a
charset is defined, currenlty implicit Charset.toStrng() is used, given
wrong format.
As in Android for UTF-16 = "com.ibm.icu4jni.charset.CharsetICU[UTF-16]".

Modifications:
Each time charset is used to be printed as its name, charset.name() is
used to get the canonical name.

Result:
Now get "UTF-16" instead.
(3.10 version)
