[#5860] Ensure removal of SslHandler not produce IllegalReferenceCountException

Motivation:

If the user removes the SslHandler while still in the processing loop we will produce an IllegalReferenceCountException. We should stop looping when the handlerwas removed.

Modifications:

Ensure we stop looping when the handler is removed.

Result:

No more IllegalReferenceCountException.
