Directly receive remote address when call accept(...)

Motivation:

There is a small race in the native transport where an accept(...) may success but a later try to obtain the remote address from the fd may fail is the fd is already closed.

Modifications:

Let accept(...) directly set the remote address.

Result:

No more race possible.
