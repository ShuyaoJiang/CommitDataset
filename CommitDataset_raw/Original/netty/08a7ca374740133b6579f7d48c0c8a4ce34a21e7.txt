Correctly pass ChannelPromise on to the next ChannelOutboundHandler when use CombinedChannelDuplexHandler.

Motivation:

Due a regression introduced by e969b6917c848c83f02617386f0f73d8f0e130a2 we missed to pass the original ChannelPromise to the next ChannelOutboundHandler and so
may never notify the origin ChannelPromise. This is related to #4805.

Modifications:

- Correctly pass the ChannelPromise
- Add unit test.

Result:

Correctly pass the ChannelPromise on deregister(...)
