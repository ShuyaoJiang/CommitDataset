HTTP/2 MaxStreams cleanup

Motivation:
765e944d4d105863ccb8e3e745285aaea0b8105b imposed a limit on the maximum number of stream in all states. However the default limit did not allow room for streams in addition to SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS. This can mean streams in states outside the states which SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS applies to may not be reliably created.

Modifications:
- The default limit should be larger than SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS

Result:
More lenient limit is applied to maxStreams by default.
