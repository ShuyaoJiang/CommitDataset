Set the session id context properly to make client authentication work with open ssl provider.

Motivation:

When netty is used with open ssl provider and client authentication the following errors can occur:
error:140D9115:SSL routines:ssl_get_prev_session:session id context uninitialized
error:140A1175:SSL routines:ssl_bytes_to_cipher_list:inappropriate fallback
error:140760FC:SSL routines:SSL23_GET_CLIENT_HELLO:unknown protocol

Modifications:

Set the session id context in OpenSslServerContext so that sessions which use client authentication
which are cached have the same context id value.

Result:

Client authentication now works with open ssl provider.
