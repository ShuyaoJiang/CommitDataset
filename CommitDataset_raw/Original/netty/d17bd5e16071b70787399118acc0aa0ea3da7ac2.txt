Adding support for whitespace in resource path in tests (#8606)

Motivation:

In windows if the project is in a path that contains whitespace,
resources cannot be accessed and tests fail.

Modifications:

Adds ResourcesUtil.java in netty-common. Tests use ResourcesUtil.java to access a resource.

Result:

Being able to build netty in a path containing whitespace
