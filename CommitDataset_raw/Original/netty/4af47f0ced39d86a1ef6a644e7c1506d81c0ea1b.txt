AbstractByteBuf.setCharSequence(...) must not expand buffer

Motivation:

AbstractByteBuf.setCharSequence(...) must not expand the buffer if not enough writable space is present in the buffer to be consistent with all the other set operations.

Modifications:

- Ensure we only exand the buffer on writeCharSequence(...) but not on setCharSequence(...)
- Add unit tests.

Result:

Consistent and correct behavior.
