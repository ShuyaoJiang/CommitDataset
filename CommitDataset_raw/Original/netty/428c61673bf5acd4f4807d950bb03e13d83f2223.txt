Logs in invokeExceptionCaught have been made consistent and full

Motivation:

In case of exception in invokeExceptionCaught() only original exception passed to invokeExceptionCaught() will be logged on any log level.
+ AbstractChannelHandlerContext and CombinedChannelDuplexHandler log different exceptions.

Modifications:

Fix inconsistent logging code and add ability to see both stacktraces on DEBUG level.

Result:

Both handlers log now both original exception and thrown from invokeExceptionCaught. To see full stacktrace of exception thrown from invokeExceptionCaught DEBUG log level must be enabled.
