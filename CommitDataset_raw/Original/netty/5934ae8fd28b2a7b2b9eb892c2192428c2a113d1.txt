Http2FrameLogger Updates

Motivation:
The Http2FrameLogger uses a custom format when logging events. We should use the more familiar format of 'channel event type: details' and single line logging for more consistent debugging.

Modifications:
- Http2FrameLogger should not use a StringBuilder and instead should directly use the Logger
- Http2FrameLogger should use the more consistent format defined above

Result:
Http2FrameLogger's logging formate is more consistent with other log events.
