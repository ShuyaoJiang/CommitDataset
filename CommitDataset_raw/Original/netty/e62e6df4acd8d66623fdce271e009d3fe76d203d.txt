Use WeakReferences for Resource Leaks

Motivation:
Phantom references are for cleaning up resources that were
forgotten, which means they keep their referent alive.   This
means garbage is kept around until the refqueue is drained, rather
than when the reference is unreachable.

Modification:
Use Weak References instead of Phantoms

Result:
More punctual leak detection.
