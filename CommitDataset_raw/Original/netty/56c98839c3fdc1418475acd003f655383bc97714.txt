[#3218] Add ChannelPool / ChannelPoolMap abstraction and implementations

Motivation:

Many projects need some kind a Channel/Connection pool implementation. While the protocols are different many things can be shared, so we should provide a generic API and implementation.

Modifications:

Add ChannelPool / ChannelPoolMap API and implementations.

Result:

Reusable / Generic pool implementation that users can use.
