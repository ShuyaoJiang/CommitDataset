[#2675] Replace synchronization performed on util.concurrent instance in TrafficCounter

Motivation:

Message from FindBugs:
This method performs synchronization an object that is an instance of a class from the java.util.concurrent package (or its subclasses). Instances of these classes have their own concurrency control mechanisms that are orthogonal to the synchronization provided by the Java keyword synchronized. For example, synchronizing on an AtomicBoolean will not prevent other threads from modifying the AtomicBoolean.
Such code may be correct, but should be carefully reviewed and documented, and may confuse people who have to maintain the code at a later date.

Modification:

Use synchronized(this)

Result:

Less confusing code
