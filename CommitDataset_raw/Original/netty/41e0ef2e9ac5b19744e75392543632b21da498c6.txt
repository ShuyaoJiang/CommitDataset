[#441] Provide a better way to handle decoder failures

* Update toString() of all HttpObject implementations
* HttpMessageDecoder does not raise an exception but sets decoderResult property of the decoded message.
* HttpMessageDecoder discards inbound traffic once decoding fails, by adding a new state called BAD_MESSAGE.
* Add a test case that tests this behavior.
