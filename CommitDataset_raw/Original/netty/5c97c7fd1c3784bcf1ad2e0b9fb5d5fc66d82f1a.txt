Resolved issue: NETTY-140 ChannelFuture.await*() should throw an IllegalStateException if dead lock is expected
* Added IoWorkerRunnable which maintains a thread local boolean variable
* Improved DefaultChannelFuture to check IoWorkerRunnable.IN_IO_THREAD to detect possible dead lock
* All I/O worker runnables are wrapped by IoWorkerRunnable.
