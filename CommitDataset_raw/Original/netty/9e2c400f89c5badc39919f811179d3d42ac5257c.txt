OpenSslEngine writePlaintextData WANT_READ with no data in BIO buffer

Motivation:
CVE-2016-4970

OpenSslEngine.wrap calls SSL_write which may return SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ, and if in this condition there is nothing to read from the BIO the OpenSslEngine and SslHandler will enter an infinite loop.

Modifications:
- Use the error code provided by OpenSSL and go back to the EventLoop selector to detect if the socket is closed

Result:
OpenSslEngine correctly handles the return codes from OpenSSL and does not enter an infinite loop.
