Add support to wrap an existing filedescriptor when using native kqueue transport

Motivation:

The native epoll transport allows to wrap an existing filedescriptor, we should support the same in the native kqueue transport.

Modifications:

Add constructors that allow to wrap and existing filedescriptor.

Result:

Featureset of native transports more on par.
