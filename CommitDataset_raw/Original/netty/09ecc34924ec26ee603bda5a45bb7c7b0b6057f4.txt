Linux EPOLL Channel Configuration test unsupported options

Motivation:
The unit tests should not fail due to using a channel option which is not supported by the underlying kernel.

Modifications:
- Ignore RuntimeExceptions which are thrown by JNI code when setsockopt or getsockopt fails.

Result:
Unit tests pass if socket option is not supported by kernel.
