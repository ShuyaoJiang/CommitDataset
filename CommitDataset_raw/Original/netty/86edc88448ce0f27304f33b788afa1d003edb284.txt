HTTP/2 LifecycleManager and Http2ConnectionHandler interface clarifications

Motiviation:
The interface provided by Http2LifecycleManager is not clear as to how the writeXXX methods should behave.  The implementation of this interface from the Http2ConnectionHandler's perspecitve is unclear what writeXXX means in this context.

Modifications:
- Method names in Http2LifecycleManager and Http2ConnectionHandler should be renamed and comments should clarify the interfaces.

Results:
Http2LifecycleManager is more clear and Http2ConnectionHandler's implementation makes sense w.r.t to return values.
