Close ObjectInputStream in ObjectDecoder.decode(...)

Motivation:

We create a new CompactObjectInputStream with ByteBufInputStream in ObjectDecoder.decode(...) method and don't close this InputStreams before return statement.

Modifications:

Save link to the ObjectInputStream and close it before return statement.

Result:

Close InputStreams and clean up unused resources. It will be better for GC.
