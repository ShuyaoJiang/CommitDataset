HttpRequestEncoder consistency with master branch

Motivation:
The HttpRequestEncoder.encodeInitialLine can now be consistent with the master branch after 85c79dbbe4e6b3e74bd84b3c2eb48fab2916fb6b

Modifications:
- Use the AsciiString and ByteBufUtil.copy methods

Result:
Consistent behavior/code between 4.1 and master branches.
