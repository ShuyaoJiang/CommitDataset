Support SSL_ prefixed cipher suites in addition to TLS_ prefixed ones.

Motivation:
Http2SecurityUtil currently lists HTTP/2 ciphers as documented by
JSSE docs [1] and the IANA [2] using the TLS_ prefix.
In some IBM J9 implementations the SSL_ prefix is used, which is also
covered by the JSSE.

[2] http://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-parameters/tls-parameters.xhtml

Modifications:
Add both variants of the cipher names (prefixed with SSL_ in additon to TLS_)

Result:
HTTP/2 connections can now be created using the SslProvider.JDK on IBM J9
and potentially other JVMs which use the SSL_ prefix.
