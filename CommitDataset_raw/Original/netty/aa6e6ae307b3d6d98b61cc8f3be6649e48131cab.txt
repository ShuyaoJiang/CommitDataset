[#4241] Ensure NioEventLoopGroup.shutdownGracefully(...) with no quiet period shutdown as fast as expected.

Motivation:

If the user uses 0 as quiet period we should shutdown without any delay if possible.

Modifications:

Ensure we not introduce extra delay when a shutdown quit period of 0 is used.

Result:

EventLoop shutdown as fast as expected.
