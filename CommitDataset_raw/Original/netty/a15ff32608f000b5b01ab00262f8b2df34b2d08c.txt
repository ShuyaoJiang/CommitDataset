HttpObjectDecoder configurable initial buffer size

Motivation:
The initial buffer size used to decode HTTP objects is currently fixed at 128. This may be too small for some use cases and create a high amount of overhead associated with resizing/copying. The user should be able to configure the initial size as they please.

Modifications:
- Make HttpObjectDecoder's AppendableCharSequence initial size configurable

Result:
Users can more finely tune initial buffer size for increased performance or to save memory.
