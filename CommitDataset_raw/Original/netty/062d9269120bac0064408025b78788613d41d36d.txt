Remove remote initiated renegotiation support

Motivation:
We recently removed support for renegotiation, but there are still some hooks to attempt to allow remote initiated renegotiation to succeed. The remote initated renegotiation can be even more problematic from a security stand point and should also be removed.

Modifications:
- Remove state related to remote iniated renegotiation from OpenSslEngine

Result:
More renegotiation code removed from the OpenSslEngine code path.
