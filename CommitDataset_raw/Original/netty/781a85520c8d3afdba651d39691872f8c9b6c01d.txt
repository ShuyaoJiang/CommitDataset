Add HTTP/2 Netty tiles example

Motivation:

Adding an example that showcases Nettyâ€™s HTTP/2 codec and that is
slightly more complex than the existing hello-world example. It is
based on the Gopher tiles example available here:
https://http2.golang.org/gophertiles?latency=0

Modifications:

Moved current http2 example to http2/helloworld.
Added http2 tiles example under http2/tiles.

Result:

A Netty tiles example is available.
