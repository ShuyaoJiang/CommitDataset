Include the original Exception that caused the Channel to be closed in the ClosedChannelException (#8863)

Motivation:

To make it easier to understand why a Channel was closed previously and so why the operation failed with a ClosedChannelException we should include the original Exception.

Modifications:

- Store the original exception that lead to the closed Channel and include it in the ClosedChannelException that is used to fail the operation.
- Add unit test

Result:

Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/8862.
