Fix the inconsistencies between performance tests in ByteBufAllocatorBenchmark

Motivation:

default*() tests are performing a test in a different way, and they must be same with other tests.

Modification:

Make sure default*() tests are same with the others

Result:

Easier to compare default and non-default allocators
