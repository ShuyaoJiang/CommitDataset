Add back the removed deprecated methods in SslContext

Motivation:

Previous backport removed the old methods and constructors. They should
not be removed in 4.x but just deprecated in favor of the new methods
and constructors.

Modifications:

Add back the removed methods and constructors in SslContext and its
subtypes for backward compatibility.

Result:

Backward compatibility issues fixed.
