Avoid object allocations for HTTP2 child streams.

Motivation:

We are allocating a hash map for every HTTP2 Stream to store it's children.
Most streams are leafs in the priority tree and don't have children.

Modification:

 - Only allocate children when we actually use them.
 - Make EmptyIntObjectMap not throw a UnsupportedOperationException on remove, but return null instead (as is stated in it's javadoc).

Result:

Fewer unnecessary allocations.
