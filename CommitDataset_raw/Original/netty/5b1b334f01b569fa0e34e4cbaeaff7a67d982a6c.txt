When null origin is supported then credentials header must not be set.

Motivation:
Currently CORS can be configured to support a 'null' origin, which can
be set by a browser if a resources is loaded from the local file system.
When this is done 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' will be set to "*" (any
origin). There is also a configuration option to allow credentials being
sent from the client (cookies, basic HTTP Authentication, client side
SSL). This is indicated by the response header
'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials' being set to true. When this is set
to true, the "*" origin is not valid as the value of
'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' and a browser will reject the request:
http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#resource-requests

Modifications:
Updated CorsHandler's setAllowCredentials to check the origin and if it
is "*" then it will not add the 'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials'
header.

Result:
Is is possible to have a client send a 'null' origin, and at the same
time have configured the CORS to support that and to allow credentials
in that combination.
