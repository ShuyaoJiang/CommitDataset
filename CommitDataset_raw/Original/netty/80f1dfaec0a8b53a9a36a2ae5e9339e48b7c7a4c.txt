[#2428] Proper fix of incorrect port range check

Motivation:

In the Internet Protocol, the valid port number range is from 1 to 65535
(inclusive on the both side.)  However, SocksCmdRequest and SocksCmdResponse
refuses to construct itself when the port number 65535 is specified. Beside
this it excepts 0 as port number which should not allowed.

    Modification:

* Not raise an exception when the specified port number is 65535.
* Raise an exception when the specified port number is 0

Result:

Fixes #2428
