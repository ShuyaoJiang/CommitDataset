MQTT encode doesn't complain if password is set but username not

Motivation:

The MQTT decoder should raise an exception trying to build a CONNECT packet where password field is set but not the username one (as by MQTT 3.1/3.1.1 spec).

Modification:

Throw exception if password field is set but not the username

Result:

Fixes [#7205].
