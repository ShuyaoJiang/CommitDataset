Attempt at improving docs in HttpObjectAggregator

Motivation:

Documentation was added in #2401 to aid developers in understanding
how HttpObjectAggregator works and that it needs an encoder before it.

In #2471 it was pointed out that the documentation added can actually
add to the confusion and that it might have a typo.

This is an attempt at clearing up that confusion.  Feedback is welcome.

Modifications:

- Adjust class level javadoc for HttpObjectAggregator
  * Remove reference to HttpRequestEncoder
  * Point out when HttpResponseEncoder is needed
  * Point out that either HttpRequestDecoder or HttpResponseDecoder is needed
  * Make clear everything must be added before HttpObjectAggregator
  * Mention HttpServerCodec

Result:

Avoid confusion about dependencies for HttpObjectAggregator on the pipeline.
