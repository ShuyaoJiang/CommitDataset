Correctly buffer multiple outbound streams if needed. (#8694)

Motivation:

In Http2FrameCodec we made the incorrect assumption that we can only have 1 buffered outboundstream as maximum. This is not correct and we need to account for multiple buffered streams.

Modifications:

- Use a map to allow buffer multiple streams
- Add unit test.

Result:

Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/8692.
