Fix AppendableCharSequence.subSequence(...) where start == end. (#8798)

Motivation:

To conform to the CharSequence interface we need to return an empty CharSequence when start == end index and a subSequence is requested.

Modifications:

- Correctly handle the case where start == end
- Add unit test

Result:

Fix https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/8796.
