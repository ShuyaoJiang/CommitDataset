Detecting actual Channel write idleness vs. slowness

Motivation

The IdleStateHandler tracks write() idleness on message granularity but does not take into consideration that the client may be just slow and has managed to consume a subset of the message's bytes in the configured period of time.

Modifications

Adding an optional configuration parameter to IdleStateHandler which tells it to observe ChannelOutboundBuffer's state.

Result

Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/6150
