[#107] Add support for closing either input or output part of a channel

- Add ChannelOption.ALLOW_HALF_CLOSURE
  - If true, ChannelInputShutdownEvent is fired via userEventTriggered()
    when the remote peer shuts down its output, and the connection is 
    not closed until a user calls close() explicitly.
  - If false, the connection is closed immediately as it did before.
- Add SocketChannel.isInputShutdown()
- Add & improve test cases related with half-closed sockets
