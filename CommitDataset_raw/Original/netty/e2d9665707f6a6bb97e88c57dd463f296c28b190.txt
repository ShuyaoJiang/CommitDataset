Added comments to LineBasedFrameDecoder, JsonObjectDecoder and XmlFrameDecoder that they are only compatible with UTF-8 encoded streams. (#8651)


Motivation:

LineBasedFrameDecoder, JsonObjectDecoder and XmlFrameDecoder upon investigation of the
sourcecode appeared to only support ASCII or UTF-8 input. It is an important characteristic
and ont reflected in any documentation. This could lead to improper usage and bugs.

Modifications:

Javadoc comment is addedd to all three classes to state that implementation is only
compatible with UTF-8 or ASCII input streams and brifly touches on implementaion details.

Result:

The end user of the netty library would not have to study sorcecode to deterime character
encoding limitations for given classes.
