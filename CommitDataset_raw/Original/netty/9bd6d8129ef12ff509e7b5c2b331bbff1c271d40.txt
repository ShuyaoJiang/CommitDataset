HttpObjectEncoder buffer size estimation

Motivation:
HttpObjectEncoder allocates a new buffer when encoding the initial line and headers, and also allocates a buffer when encoding the trailers. The allocation always uses the default size of 256. This may lead to consistent under allocation and require a few resize/copy operations which can cause GC/memory pressure.

Modifications:
- Introduce a weighted average which tracks the historical size of encoded data and uses this as an estimate for future buffer allocations

Result:
Better approximation of buffer sizes.
