[#4794] Support window size flag by default if ZlibCodecFactory supports it.

Motivation:

If the ZlibCodecFactory can support using a custom window size we should support it by default in the websocket extensions as well.

Modifications:

Detect if a custom window size can be handled by the ZlibCodecFactory and if so enable it by default for PerMessageDeflate*ExtensionHandshaker.

Result:

Support window size flag by default in most installations.
