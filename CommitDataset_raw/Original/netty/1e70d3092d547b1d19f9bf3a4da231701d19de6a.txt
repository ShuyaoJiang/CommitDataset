Avoid register multiple cleaner task for same thread's FastThreadLocal index

Motivation:

Currently if user call set/remove/set/remove many times, it will create multiple cleaner task for same index. It may cause OOM due to long live thread will have more and more task in LIVE_SET.

Modification:

Add flag to avoid recreating tasks.

Result:
Only create 1 clean task. But use more space of indexedVariables.
