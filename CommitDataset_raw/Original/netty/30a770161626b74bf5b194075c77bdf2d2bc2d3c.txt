Add support for RFC2385 on Linux

Motivation:

There are protocols (BGP, SXP), which are typically deployed with TCP
MD5 authentication to protect sessions from being hijacked/torn down by
third parties. This facility is not available on most operating systems,
but is typically present on Linux.

Modifications:

- add a new EpollChannelOption, which is write-only
- teach Epoll(Server)SocketChannel to track which addresses have keys
  associated
- teach Native how to set the MD5 signature keys for a socket

Result:

Users of the native-epoll transport can set MD5 signature keys and thus
leverage RFC-2385 protection on TCP connections.
