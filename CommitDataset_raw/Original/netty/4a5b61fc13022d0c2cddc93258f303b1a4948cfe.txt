Fix log message about using non-direct buffers by default (#8235)

Motivation:

f77891cc1786806630f6c4408d5d37abb1891e7b changed slightly how we detect if we should prefer direct buffers or not but did miss to also take this into account when logging.

Modifications:

Fix branch for log message to reflect changes in f77891cc1786806630f6c4408d5d37abb1891e7b.

Result:

Correct logging.
