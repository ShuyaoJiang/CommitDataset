The "null" ClassLoader is the bootstrap ClassLoader

Motivation:
Class.forName() documents that null will use bootstrap loader:
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Class.html#forName-java.lang.String-boolean-java.lang.ClassLoader-

But the link between "null" and bootstrap loader is even more explicit
in ClassLoader's documentation:
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/ClassLoader.html#getParent--

The current code is trying to use the bootstrap loader but seems to have
not been aware of the meaning of null.

Modifications:
Use "null" as the class loader when we want to load classes in the
bootstrap loader.

Result:
More reliable ALPN/NPN loading and simpler code.
