Auto-generating primitive collections for int and char keys.

Motivation:

Currently we have IntObjectMap/HashMap, but it will be useful to support other primitive-based maps.

Modifications:

Moved the code int the current maps to template files and run Groovy code from  common/pom.xml to apply the templates.

Result:

Autogeneration of int and char-based hash maps.
