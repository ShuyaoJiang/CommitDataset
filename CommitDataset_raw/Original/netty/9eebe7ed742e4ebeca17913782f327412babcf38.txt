Add full JdkSslContext public constructor, close #8384 (#8389)

Motivation:

JdkSslContext provides public constructors to wrap an existing `javax.net.ssl.SSLContext`.

Sadly, some options combinations are not possible with the existing constructors, eg:
*  protocols is not exposed and always forced to null, so default protocols are always enforced
* startTls is not exposed and always forced to false

Modification:

Add full constructor that take protocols and startTls parameters.

Result:

It's possible to create a JdkSslContext from an existing SSLContext and still have control over protocols and startTls
