[#3127] Allow to write with VoidPromise to Channels in ChannelGroup

Motivation:

Users sometimes want to use Channel.voidPromise() when write to a Channel to reduce GC-pressure. This should be also possible when write via a ChannelGroup.

Modifications:

Add new write(...) and writeAndFlush(...) overloads which allow to signale that a VoidPromise should be used to write to the Channel

Result:

Users can write with VoidPromise when using ChannelGroup
