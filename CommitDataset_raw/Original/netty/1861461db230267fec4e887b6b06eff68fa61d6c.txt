[#4635] Stop decoding if decoder was removed in ReplayingDecoder

We need to check if this handler was removed before continuing with decoding.
If it was removed, it is not safe to continue to operate on the buffer. This was already fixed for ByteToMessageDecoder in 4cdbe3928424b5b38695967c0cc1062dccf1a83c  but missed for ReplayingDecoder.

Modifications:

Check if decoder was removed after fire messages through the pipeline.

Result:

No illegal buffer access when decoder was removed.
