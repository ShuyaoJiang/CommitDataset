Call finishConnect() before try to call read(...) / write(...) when using NIO

Motivation:

The JDK implementation of SocketChannel has an internal state that is tracked for its operations. Because of this we need to ensure we call finishConnect() before try to call read(...) / write(...) as otherwise it may produce a NotYetConnectedException.

Modifications:

First process OP_CONNECT flag.

Result:

No more possibility of NotYetConnectedException because OP_CONNECT is handled not early enough when processing interestedOps for a Channel.
