[#2823] Writing DefaultFileRegion with EpollSocketChannel may cause hang

Motivation:

In EpollSocketchannel.doWriteFileRegion(...) we need to make sure we write until sendFile(...) returns either 0 or all is written. Otherwise we may not get notified once the Channel is writable again.

This is the case as we use EPOLL_ET.

Modifications:

Always write until either sendFile returns 0 or all is written.

Result:

No more hangs when writing DefaultFileRegion can happen.
