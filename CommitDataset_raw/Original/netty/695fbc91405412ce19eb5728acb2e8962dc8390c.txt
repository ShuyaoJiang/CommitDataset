[#2684] EpollSocketChannel gathering writes should take fast-path if possible

Motivation:

In EpollSocketchannel.writeBytesMultiple(...) we loop over all buffers to see if we need to adjust the readerIndex for incomplete writes. We can skip this if we know that everything was written (a.k.a complete write).

Modification:

Use fast-path if all bytes are written and so no need to loop over buffers

Result:

Fast write path for the average use.
