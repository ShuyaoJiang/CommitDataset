[#4327] Ensure toString() will not throw IllegalReferenceCountException

Motivation:

As toString() is often used while logging we need to ensure this produces no exception.

Modifications:

Ensure we never throw an IllegalReferenceCountException.

Result:

Be able to log without produce exceptions.
