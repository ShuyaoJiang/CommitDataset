#7695 no need to manually release chunk during upload (#7696)

Motivation:

After #7527 fix there is no need to manually release chunks (HttpData) during file upload as they will be released on HttpPostRequestDecoder.destroy().

Modification:

HttpUploadServer example doesn't release chunks manually (doesn't call data.release()).

Result:
Fixes #7695 and #7689
