SslHandler avoid calling wrap/unwrap when unnecessary

Motivation:
The SSLEngine wrap and unwrap methods can be called in a way that has no side effects, but this could involve costly validation and allocation. The SslHandler should avoid calling into these methods if possible.

Modifications:
- wrapNonAppData should provide additional status which can be used by wrap to breakout early if possible

Result:
SslHandler invokes the SSLEngine less.
