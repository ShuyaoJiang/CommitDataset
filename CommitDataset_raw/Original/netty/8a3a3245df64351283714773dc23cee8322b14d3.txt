Ensure Unsafe buffer implementations are used when sun.misc.Unsafe is present

Motivation:

When sun.misc.Unsafe is present we want to use *Unsafe*ByteBuf implementations. We missed to do so in PooledByteBufAllocator when the heapArena is null.

Modifications:

- Correctly use UnpooledUnsafeHeapByteBuf
- Add unit tests

Result:

Use most optimal ByteBuf implementation.
