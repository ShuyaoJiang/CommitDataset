Checks accessibility in the #slice and #duplicate methods of ByteBuf (#7846)

Motivation:
The `ByteBuf#slice` and `ByteBuf#duplicate` methods should check
an accessibility to prevent creation slice or duplicate
of released buffer. At now this works not in the all scenarios.

Modifications:
Add missed checks.

Result:
More correct and consistent behavior of `ByteBuf` methods.
