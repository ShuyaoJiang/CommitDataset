Deprecation cleanup for HTTP headers

Motivaion:
The HttpHeaders and DefaultHttpHeaders have methods deprecated due to being removed in future releases, but no replacement method to use in the current release. The deprecation policy should not be so aggressive as to not provide any non-deprecated method to use.

Modifications:
- Remove deprecated annotations and javadocs from methods which are the best we can do in terms of matching the master's api for 4.1

Result:
There should be non-deprecated methods available for HttpHeaders in 4.1.
