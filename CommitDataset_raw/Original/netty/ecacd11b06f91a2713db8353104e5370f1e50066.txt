HTTP/2 limit header accumulated size

Motivation:
The Http2FrameListener requires that the Http2FrameReader accumulate ByteBuf objects. There is currently no way to limit the amount of bytes that is accumulated.

Motiviation:
- DefaultHttp2FrameReader supports maxHeaderSize which will fail fast as soon as the maximum size is exceeded.
- DefaultHttp2HeadersDecoder will respect the return value of endHeaderBlock() and fail if the max size is exceeded.

Result:
Frames which carry header data now respect a maximum number of bytes that can be accumulated.
