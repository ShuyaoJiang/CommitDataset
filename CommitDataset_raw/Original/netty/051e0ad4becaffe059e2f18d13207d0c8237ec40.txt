Add support for IP_TRANSPARENT socket option

Motivation:

This allows netty to operate in 'transparent proxy' mode, intercepting connections
to other addresses by means of Linux firewalling rules, as per

https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/tproxy.txt

The original destination address can be obtained by referencing
ch.localAddress().

Modification:

Add methods similar to those for ipFreeBind, to set the IP_TRANSPARENT option.

Result:

Allows setting and getting of the IP_TRANSPARENT option, which allows retrieval of the ultimate socket address originally requested.
