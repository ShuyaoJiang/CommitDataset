Share code that is needed to support shaded native libraries.

Motivation:

For our native libraries in netty we support shading, to have this work on runtime the user needs to set a system property. This code should shared.

Modifications:

Move logic to NativeLbiraryLoader and so share for all native libs.

Result:

Less code duplication and also will work for netty-tcnative out of the box once it support shading
