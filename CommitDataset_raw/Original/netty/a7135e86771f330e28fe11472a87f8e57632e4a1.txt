HttpObjectAggregator doesn't check content-length header

Motivation:
The HttpObjectAggregator always responds with a 100-continue response. It should check the Content-Length header to see if the content length is OK, and if not responds with a 417.

Modifications:
- HttpObjectAggregator checks the Content-Length header in the case of a 100-continue.

Result:
HttpObjectAggregator responds with 417 if content is known to be too big.
