Leak detection combined with composite buffers results in incorrectly handled writerIndex when calling ByteBufUtil.writeAscii/writeUtf8 (#8153)

Motivation:

We need to add special handling for WrappedCompositeByteBuf as these also extend AbstractByteBuf, otherwise we will not correctly adjust / read the writerIndex during processing.

Modifications:

- Add instanceof checks for WrappedCompositeByteBuf as well.
- Add testcases

Result:

Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/8152.
