ObjectCleaner should continue cleaning despite exceptions

Motivation:
ObjectCleaner inovkes a Runnable which may execute user code (FastThreadLocal#onRemoval) and therefore exceptions maybe thrown. If an exception is thrown the cleanup thread will exit prematurely and we may never finish cleaning up which will result in leaks.

Modifications:
- ObjectCleaner should suppress exceptions and continue cleaning

Result:
ObjectCleaner will reliably clean despite exceptions being thrown.
