DefaultDnsCache should store more then one Entry per hostname. (#7906)

Motivation:

Due a bug we did never store more then one address per hostname in DefaultDnsCache.

Modifications:

- Correctly store multiple entries per hostname
- Add tests

Result:

DefaultDnsCache correctly stores more then one entry. Also fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/7882 .
