First call channelReadComplete(...) before flush(...) for better performance

Motivation:

In Http2ConnectionHandler we call flush(...) in channelReadComplete(...) to ensure we update the flow-controller and write stuff to the remote peer. We should better flip the order and so may be able to pick up more bytes.

Modifications:

Change order of calls.

Result:

Better performance
