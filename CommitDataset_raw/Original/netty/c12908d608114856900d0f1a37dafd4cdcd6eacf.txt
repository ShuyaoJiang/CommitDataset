Allow to compile and run tests with different java versions

Motivation:

As we now need to compile with java8 we should still allow to run the tests with a different java version to ensure everythin also works with java 7 and 6.

Modifications:

Allow to pass "-DtestJavaHome" to the build and so use a different java version during running the tests.

Result:

Be able to run tests with different java versions.
