In (Pooled|Unpooled)UnsafeDirectByteBuf copy memory directly to and from ByteBuffer

Motivation:

When moving bytes between a PooledUnsafeDirectByteBuf or an UnpooledUnsafeDirectByteBuf
and a ByteBuffer, a temp ByteBuffer is allocated and will need to be GCed. This is a
common case since a ByteBuffer is always needed when reading/writing on a file,
for example.

Modifications:

Use PlatformDependent.copyMemory() to avoid the need for the temp ByteBuffer

Result:

No temp ByteBuffer allocated and GCed.
