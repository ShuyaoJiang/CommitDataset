Never expose user.dir to the web on directory listing

Motivation:

When Netty HTTP Static File Server does directory listing, it does expose the user.dir environment variable to the user. Although it doesn't a security issue, it is a bad practice to show it, and the user does expect to see the server virtual root instead, which is the absolute path as mentioned in the RFC.

Modifications:

the sendListing method receives a third argument, which is the requested URI, and this is what should be displayed on the page instead of the filesystem path.

Result:

The directory listing pages will show the virtual path as described in the URI and not the real filesystem path.

Removed fallback method
