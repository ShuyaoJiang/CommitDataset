Only use test SslProviders that are supported in SslHandlerTest.testCompositeBufSizeEstimationGuaranteesSynchronousWrite().

Motivation:

We need to ensure we only try to to test with the SslProviders that are supported when running the SslHandlerTest.testCompositeBufSizeEstimationGuaranteesSynchronousWrite test.

Modifications:

Skip SslProvider.OPENSSL* if not supported.

Result:

No more test-failures if openssl is not installed on the system.
