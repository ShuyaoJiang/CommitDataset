Fix possible deadlock in DefaultChannelPipeline.destroyDown(...)

Motivation:

We need to ensure we not hold a lock while executor callHandlerRemoved(...) as this may lead to a deadlock if handlerRemoved(...) will call another method in DEfaultChannelPipeline from another thread that will need to obtain the lock as well and wait for the result.

Modifications:

Release the lock before call handlerRemoved0(...).

Result:

No more deadlock possible
