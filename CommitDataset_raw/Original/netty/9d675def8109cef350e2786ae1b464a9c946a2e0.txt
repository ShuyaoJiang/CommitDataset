Only call System.nanoTime() if no read batch is ongoing. Related to [#3808]

Motivation:

[#3808] introduced some improvements to reduce the calls to System.nanoTime() but missed one possible optimization.

Modifications:

Only call System.nanoTime() if no reading patch is in process.

Result:

Less System.nanoTime() calls.
