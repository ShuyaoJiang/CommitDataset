Fix a bug where DefaultPromise.toString() says 'incomplete' when it's done

Motivation:

DefaultPromise.toString() returns 'DefaultPromise(incomplete)' when it's
actually complete with non-null result.

Modifications:

Handle the case where the promise is done and its result is non-null in
toString()

Result:

The String returned by DefaultPromise.toString() is not confusing
anymore.
