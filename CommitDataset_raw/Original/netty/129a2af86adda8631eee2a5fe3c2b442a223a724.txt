Initial working version of the echo server example

- Optimized AbstractChannelBuffer.discardReadBytes()
- Split ChannelHandlerInvoker into ChannelInboundInvoker and
  ChannelOutboundInvoker
  - Channel implements ChannelOutboundInvoker
  - ChannelOutboundInvoker.nextOut() is now out()
  - ChannelOutboundHandlerContext.out() is now prevOut()
  - Added the outbound operations without future
    parameter to ChannelOutboundInvoker for user convenience
- All async operations which requires a ChannelFuture as a parameter
  now returns ChannelFuture for user convenience
- Added ChannelFutureFactory.newVoidFuture() to allow a user specify
  a dummy future that is of no use
  - I'm unsure if it is actually a good idea to introduce it. It might
    go away later.
- Made the contract of AbstractChannel.doXXX() much simpler and moved
  all common code up to AbstractChannel.DefaultUnsafe
- Added Channel.isOpen()
- Fixed a bug where MultithreadEventLoop always shut down its child
  event loops on construction
- Maybe more changes I don't remember :-)
