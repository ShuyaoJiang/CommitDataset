Throw ReadOnlyBufferException if unsafe buffer is used and dst is direct

Motivation:

We missed to check if the dst is ready only before using unsafe to copy data into it which lead to data-corruption. We need to ensure we respect ready only ByteBuffer.

Modifications:

- Correctly check if the dst is ready only before copy data into it in UnsafeByteBufUtil
- Also make it work for buffers that are not direct and not have an array

Result:

No more data corruption possible if the dst buffer is readonly and unsafe buffer implementation is used.
