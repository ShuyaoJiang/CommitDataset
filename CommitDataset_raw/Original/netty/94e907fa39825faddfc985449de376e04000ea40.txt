Only call ReferenceCountUtil.touch(...) if ResourceLeakDetection was enabled when Channel was created.

Motivation:

We should only call ReferenceCountUtil.touch(...) if needed as otherwise we pay the overhead of instanceof and cast
everytime.

Modifications:

Add boolean flag which indicates if touch(...) should be called.

Result:

Less overhead when leak detection is not enabled.
