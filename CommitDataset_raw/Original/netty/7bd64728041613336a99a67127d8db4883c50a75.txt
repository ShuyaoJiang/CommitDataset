HTTP/2 DataCompressionHttp2Test test complete race condition

Motivation:
The DataCompressionHttp2Test was exiting prematurely leading to unit test failures.

Modifications:
- Fix the race condition so the test does not evaluate final conditions until all expected events occur

Result:
Unit test no longer fails
