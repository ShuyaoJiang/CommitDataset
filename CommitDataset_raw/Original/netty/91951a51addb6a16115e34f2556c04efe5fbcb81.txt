Ensure calling ReferenceCountedSslEngine.unwrap(...) / wrap(...) can be called after it was closed

Motivation:

The JDK implementation of SSLEngine allows to have unwrap(...) / wrap(...) called even after closeInbound() and closeOutbound() were called. We need to support the same in ReferenceCountedSslEngine.

Modification:

- Allow calling ReferenceCountedSslEngine.unwrap(...) / wrap(...) after the engine was closed
- Modify unit test to ensure correct behaviour.

Result:

Implementation works as expected.
