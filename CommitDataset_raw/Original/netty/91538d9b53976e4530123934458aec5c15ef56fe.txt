[#3438] Throw pre-instanced IOException on connection reset

Motivation:

In the native transport we should throw a pre-instanced IOException on connection reset while reading.

Modifications:

Correctly throw pre-instanced IOException when ECONNRESET is received

Result:

Less overhead on connection reset
