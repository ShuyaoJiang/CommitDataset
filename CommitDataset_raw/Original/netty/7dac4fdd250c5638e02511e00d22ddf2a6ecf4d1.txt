Do not try to be unsafe when told not to be unsafe

Motivation:

Netty has a flag (io.netty.noUnsafe) for specifying to Netty to not be
unsafe. Yet, when initializing PlatformDependent0, Netty still tries to
be unsafe. For application that specify to Netty to not be unsafe and
run under a security manager, this can lead to an obnoxious (debug
level) stack trace. Since Netty was told not to be unsafe, Netty should
not try to be unsafe.

Modifications:

The initialization logic in PlatformDependent0 should take into account
that Netty was told not to be unsafe. This means that we need to
initialize PlatformDependent#IS_EXPLICIT_NO_UNSAFE as soon as possible,
before the static initializer for PlatformDependent0 has a chance to
run. Thus the following modifications are made:
 - initialize PlatformDependent#IS_EXPLICIT_NO_UNSAFE before any other
   code in PlatformDependent causes PlatformDependent0 to initialize
 - expose the value of PlatformDependent#IS_EXPLICIT_NO_UNSAFE for
   reading in PlatformDependent0
 - take the value of PlatformDependent#IS_EXPLICIT_NO_UNSAFE into
   account in PlatformDependent0

Result:

Netty does not try to be unsafe when told not to be unsafe.
