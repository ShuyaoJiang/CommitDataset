PlatformDependent#getClassLoader fails in restrictive classloader environment

Motivation:
https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/6042 only addressed PlatformDependent#getSystemClassLoader but getClassLoader is also called in an optional manner in some common code paths but fails to catch a general enough exception to continue working.

Modifications:
- Calls to getClassLoader which can continue if results fail should catch Throwable

Result:
More resilient code in the presense of restrictive class loaders.
Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/6246.
