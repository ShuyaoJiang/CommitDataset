Do not replace System.err during Slf4JLoggerFactory construction

Motivation:

Replacing System.err during Slf4JLoggerFactory construction is problematic as another class may optain the System.err reference before we set it back to the original value.

Modifications:

Remove code that temporary replaced System.err.

Result:

Fixes [#6212].
