ByteBufUtilTest bug

Motivation:
The logic in ByteBufUtilTest.ByteBufUtilTest is wrong. It is attempting to ensure at least 1 byte is different in the ranges that will be subsequently compared, but does so before the copy operation.

Modifications:
- Move the code which ensures there is a difference to after the copy
- Simplify the logic which ensures there is a difference

Result:
Unit test now operates as designed.
