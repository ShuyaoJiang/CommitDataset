Include mvn wrapper to make setup of development env easier

Motivation:
Someone intending to contribute should be able to set up their development environment quickly and easily.

Modifications:
- Added a Maven wrapper such that a local Maven installation isn't necessary.
- Added a .gitattributes such that auto line-endings are enforced.

Result:
- ./mvnw is enough to build.
- Git line-endings are enforced.
- Fixes #7578.
