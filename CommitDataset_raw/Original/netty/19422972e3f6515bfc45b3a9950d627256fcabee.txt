Fix and simplify freeing a direct buffer / Fix Android support

Motivation:

6e8ba291cfcb325fe4397a8e7db43579070e7a07 introduced a regression in Android because Android does not have sun.nio.ch.DirectBuffer (see #2330.)  I also found PlatformDependent0.freeDirectBuffer() and freeDirectBufferUnsafe() are pretty much same after the commit and the unsafe version should be removed.

Modifications:

- Do not use the pooled allocator in Android because it's too resource hungry for Androids.
- Merge PlatformDependent0.freeDirectBuffer() and freeDirectBufferUnsafe() into one method.
- Make the Unsafe unavailable when sun.nio.ch.DirectBuffer is unavailable.  We could keep the Unsafe available and handle the sun.nio.ch.DirectBuffer case separately, but I don't want to complicate our code just because of that.  All supported JDK versions have sun.nio.ch.DirectBuffer if the Unsafe is available.

Result:

Simpler code. Fixes Android support (#2330)
