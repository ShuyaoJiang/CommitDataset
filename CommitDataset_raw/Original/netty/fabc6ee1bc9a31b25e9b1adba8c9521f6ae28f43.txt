Fix flaky ChannelInitializerTest.testChannelInitializerEventExecutor() (#8738)

Motivation:

testChannelInitializerEventExecutor() did sometimes fail as we sometimes miss to count down the latch. This can happen when we remove the handler from the pipeline before channelUnregistered(...) was called for it.

Modifications:

Countdown the latch in handlerRemoved(...).

Result:

Fix flaky test.
