Allow negative memoryAddress when calling PlatformDependent0.newDirectBuffer(...)

Motivation:

When UNSAFE.allocateMemory is returning an address whose high bit is set we currently throw an IllegalArgumentException. This is not correct as it may return a negative number on at least sparc.

Modifications:

- Allow to pass in negative memoryAddress
- Add unit tests

Result:

Correctly validate the memoryAddress and so also work on sparc as expected. Fixes [#6574].
