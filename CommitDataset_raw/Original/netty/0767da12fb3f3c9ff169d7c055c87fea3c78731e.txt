Fix possible AttributeMap corruption on double removal

Motivation:

When remove0() is called multiple times for an DefaultAttribute it can cause corruption of the internal linked-list structure.

Modifications:

- Ensure remove0() can not cause corruption by null out prev and next references.

Result:

No more corruption possible
