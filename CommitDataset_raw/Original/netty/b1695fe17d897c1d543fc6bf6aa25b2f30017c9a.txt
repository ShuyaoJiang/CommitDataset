Ensure async failures are correctly propagated to Http2LifecycleManager.onError(...) in all cases.

Motivation:

If DefaultHttp2ConnectionEncoder process outbound operation it sometimes missed to call Http2LifecycleManager.onError(...) when the operation was executed asynchronously.

Modifications:

Make best effort to update flags but still ensure failures are propageted to Http2LifecycleManager.onError(...) in all cases.

Result:

More consistent handling of errors.
