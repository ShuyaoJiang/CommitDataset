Fix improper synchronization in DefaultPromise. Fixes #5489

Motivation:

A race detector found that DefaultPromise.listeners is improperly synchronized [1].
Worst case a listener will not be executed when the promise is completed.

Modifications:

Make DefaultPromise.listeners a volatile.

Result:

Hopefully, DefaultPromise is more correct under concurrent execution.
