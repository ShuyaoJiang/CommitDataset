Correct unit test flaw introduced in 54c9ecf682eeafaaf7c826903c60f1c783b84dea

Motivation:
54c9ecf682eeafaaf7c826903c60f1c783b84dea introduced a unit tests which attempted to exclude addresses which resolved to loop back addresses from an assert statement. This was done with a static check for localhost but depending on machine configuration it is possible for other interfaces to be resolved.

Modifications:
- Use InetAddress#isLoopbackAddress() instead of string match on localhost

Result:
DnsNameResolverTest#testNameServerCache is more reliable.
