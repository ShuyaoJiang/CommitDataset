Remove optional dependency on javassist

Motivation:

We shipped a javassist based implementation for typematching and logged a confusing debug message about missing javassist. We never were able to prove it really gives any perf improvements so we should just remove it.

Modifications:

- Remove javassist dependency and impl
- Fix possible classloader deadlock as reported by intellij

Result:

Less code to maintain and less confusing log message.
