Support ALLOW_HALF_CLOSURE channel option on Unix domain socket. (#8932)

Motivation:

Since DomainSocketChannel is a DuplexChannel,  which be able to shutdown input or output individually on demands, but ALLOW_HALF_CLOSURE channel option has not been supported yet.

I thought this could be a missing feature of Unix domain socket, so here the PR for it.

Modifications:

1. Added allHalfClosure property both in  EpollDomainSocketChannelConfig and KQueueDomainSocketChannelConfig,
2. Enabled isAllowHalfClosure method of native channel to support domain channel config,
3. Created EpollDomainSocketShutdownOutputByPeerTest and KQueueDomainSocketShutdownOutputByPeerTest to verify the change.

Result:

ALLOW_HALF_CLOSURE channel option can be set with DomainSocketChannel, and no more warning of Unknown channel option 'ALLOW_HALF_CLOSURE'.
