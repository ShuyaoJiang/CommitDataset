[#4993] Correctly handle trailing dot in DNS requests and responses for the hostname.

Motivation:

We need to handle the trailing dot in the correct manner when creating DNS questions and responses.

Modifications:

- Add a trailing dot if not given to the hostname when construct a AbstractDnsRecord (this is the same as dig does).

Result:

Correctly handle trailing dots.
