Allow to use TLSv1.3 with netty-tcnative withe java versions prior to 11. (#8394)

Motivation:

At the moment it's only possible to use TLSv1.3 with netty-tcnative if Java 11 is used. It should be possible to do so even with Java 8, 9 and 10.

Modification:

Add a workaround to be able to use TLSv1.3 also when using Java version prior to Java 11 and the default X509ExtendedTrustManager is used.

Result:

Be able to use TLSv1.3 also with past versions of Java.
