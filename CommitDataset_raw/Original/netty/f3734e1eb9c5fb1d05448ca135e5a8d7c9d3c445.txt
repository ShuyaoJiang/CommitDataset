Simplified DefaultChannelPipeline by making its list head final

- Previously, head was a volatile field which is null at the beginning.
  While iterating over the pipeline, if the loop hits null, it called
  Channel.Unsafe explicitly.
- Instead, I created an outbound handler that redirects all requests
  to the unsafe and made it a final field of the pipeline.
- As a result, DefaultChannelPipeline code became much simpler.
