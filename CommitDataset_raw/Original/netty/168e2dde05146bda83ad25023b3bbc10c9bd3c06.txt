[#2706] Allow pid up to 4194304

Motivation:

The PID_MAX_LIMIT on 64bit linux systems is 4194304 and on osx it is 99998. At the moment we use 65535 as an upper-limit which is too small.

Modifications:

Use 4194304 as max possible value

Result:

No more false-positives when try to detect current pid.
