Correctly discard messages after oversized message is detected. (#9015)

Motivation:

32563bfcc129ef9332f175c277e4f6b59fd37d8c introduced a regression in which we did now not longer discard the messages after we handled an oversized message.

Modifications:

- Do not set aggregating to false after handleOversizedMessage is called
- Adjust unit tests to verify the behaviour is correct again.

Result:

Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/9007.
