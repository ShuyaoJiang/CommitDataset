HTTP Headers Over Deprecation

Motivation:
As part of recent efforts to rectify performance and make 4.1 headers more similar to 5.0 some methods were deprecated. Some of these methods were deprecated because they used String instead of CharSequence in the signature, which may require casting at the user level. Some of the deprecated methods have no direct alternatives and were done to inform a user the method will go away in future releases.

Modifications:
- Remove the deprecated qualifier from methods where no direct replacement exists

Result:
Less warnings in user code.
