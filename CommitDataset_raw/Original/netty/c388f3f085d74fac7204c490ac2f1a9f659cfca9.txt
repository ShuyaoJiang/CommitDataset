Removing Http2StreamRemovalPolicy

Motivation:

Due to a recent flurry of cleanup and fixes, we no longer need the stream removal policy to protect against recently removed streams. We should get rid of it.

Modifications:

Removed Http2StreamRemovalPolicy and everywhere it's used.

Result:

Fixes #3448
