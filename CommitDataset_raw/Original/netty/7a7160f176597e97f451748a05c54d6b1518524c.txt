HTTP/2 Buffer Leak if UTF8 Conversion Fails

Motivation:
Http2CodecUtil uses ByteBufUtil.writeUtf8 but does not account for it
throwing an exception. If an exception is thrown because the format is
not valid UTF16 encoded UTF8 then the buffer will leak.

Modifications:
- Make sure the buffer is released if an exception is thrown
- Ensure call sites of the Http2CodecUtil.toByteBuf can tolerate and
  exception being thrown

Result:
No leak if exception data can not be converted to UTF8.
