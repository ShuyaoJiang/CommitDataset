Fixed issue: NETTY-165 FrameDecoder and ReplayingDecoder must call decodeLast even if there's no data in the buffer.
* Made sure decodeLast() is called even if the cumulative buffer is empty so that a decoder implementation always get notified when the connection is closed
* Updated Javadoc to explain that the buffer can be empty
