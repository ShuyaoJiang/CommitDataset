Ported IdleStateHandler / Forward-ported the UptimeClient example

- Add ChannelHandlerContext.eventLoop() for convenience
- Bootstrap and ServerBootstrap handles channel initialization failure
  better
- More strict checks for missing @Sharable annotation
  - A handler without @Sharable annotation cannot be added more than
    once now.
