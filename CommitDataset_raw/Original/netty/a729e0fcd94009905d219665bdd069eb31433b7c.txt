Decouple DefaultChannelPipeline from AbstractChannel

Motivation:

DefaultChannelPipeline was tightly coupled to AbstractChannel which is not really needed.

Modifications:

Move logic of calling handlerAdded(...) for handlers that were added before the Channel was registered to DefaultChannelPipeline by making it part of the head context.

Result:

Less coupling and so be able to use DefaultChannelPipeline also with other Channel implementations that not extend AbstractChannel
