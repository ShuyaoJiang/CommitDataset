ByteBufUtil use IndexOfProcessor to find occurrence.

Motivation:
The way of firstIndexOf and lastIndexOf iterating the ByteBuf is similar to forEachByte and forEachByteDesc, but have many range checks.
Modifications:
Use forEachByte and a IndexOfProcessor to find occurrence.
Result:
eliminate range checks
