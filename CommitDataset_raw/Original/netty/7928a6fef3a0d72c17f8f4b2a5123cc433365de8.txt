NioDatagramChannel invalid usage of internalNioBuffer

Motivation:
NioDatagramChannel attempts to unpack a AddressedEnvelope and unconditionally uses internalNioBuffer. However if the ByteBuf is a CompositeByteBuf with more than 1 components, the write will fail and throw an exception.

Modifications:
- NioDatagramChannel should check the nioBufferCount before attempting
to use internalNioBuffer

Result:
No more failure to write UDP packets on NIO when a CompositeByteBuf is
used.
