Read if needed on ProxyHandler's handshake. Fixes #5933.

Motivation:

When auto-read is disabled and no reads are issued by a user, ProxyHandler will stall the connection on the proxy handshake phase waiting for the first response from a server (that was never read).

Modifications:

Read if needed when very first handshake message is send by ProxyHandler.

Result:

Proxy handshake now succeeds no matter if auto-read disabled or enabled. Without the fix, the new test is failing on master.
