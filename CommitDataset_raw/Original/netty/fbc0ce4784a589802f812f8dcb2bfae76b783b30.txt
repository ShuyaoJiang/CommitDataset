Avoid unnecessary string conversion where possible

Motivation:

HttpResponseStaus, HttpMethod and HttpVersion have methods that return
AsciiString.  There's no need for object-to-string conversion.

Modifications:

Use codeAsText(), name(), text() instead of setInt() and setObject()

Result:

Efficiency
