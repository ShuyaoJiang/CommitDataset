[#3724] HTTP/2 Headers END_STREAM results in RST_STREAM

Motivation:
If headers are sent on a stream that does not yet exist and the END_STREAM flag is set we will send a RST_STREAM frame. We should send the HEADERS frame and no RST_STREAM.

Modifications:
DefaultHttp2RemoteFlowController should allow frames to be sent if stream is created in the 'half closed (local)' state.

Result:
We can send HEADERS frame with the END_STREAM flag sent without sending a RST_STREAM frame.
