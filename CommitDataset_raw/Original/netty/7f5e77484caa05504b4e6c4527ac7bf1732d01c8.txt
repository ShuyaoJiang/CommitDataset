Fix support for shading native libraries which was broken in b818852cdb0ee56ce3cf939e2faa538d519baabd. (#8091)

Motivation:

b818852cdb0ee56ce3cf939e2faa538d519baabd broke support for shading the native libraries in netty as it missed to respect the package prefix that is used when shading.

Modifications:

Correctly respect package prefix for constructor argument and include the used classname when logging that we could not find the constructor.

Result:

Be able to shade native libraries of netty again.
