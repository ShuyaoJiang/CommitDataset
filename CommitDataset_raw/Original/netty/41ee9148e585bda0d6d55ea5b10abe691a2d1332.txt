HTTP/2 InboundHttp2ToHttpAdapterTest serverChannel NPE

Motivation:
InboundHttp2ToHttpAdapterTest.bootstrapEnv does not wait for the serverConnectedChannel to be initialized before returning. Some methods rely only this behavior and throw a NPE because it may not be set.

Modifications:
- Add a CountDownLatch to ensure the serverConnectedChannel is initialized

Result:
No more NPE.
