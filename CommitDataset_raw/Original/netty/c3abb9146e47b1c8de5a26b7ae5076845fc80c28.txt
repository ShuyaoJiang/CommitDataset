Use shaded dependency on JCTools instead of copy and paste

Motivation:
JCTools supports both non-unsafe, unsafe versions of queues and JDK6 which allows us to shade the library in netty-common allowing it to stay "zero dependency".

Modifications:
- Remove copy paste JCTools code and shade the library (dependencies that are shaded should be removed from the <dependencies> section of the generated POM).
- Remove usage of OneTimeTask and remove it all together.

Result:
Less code to maintain and easier to update JCTools and less GC pressure as the queue implementation nt creates so much garbage
