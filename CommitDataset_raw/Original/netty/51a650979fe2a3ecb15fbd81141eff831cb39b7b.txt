Skip test on windows as the semantics we expect are only true on Linux / Unix / BSD / MacOS (#8629)

Motivation:

In the test we assume some semantics on how RST is done that are not true for Windows so we should skip it.

Modifications:

Skip test when on windows.

Result:

Be able to run testsuite on windows. Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/8571.
