V4.1 Fix "=" character in HttpPostRequestDecoder

Motivation
Issue #3004 shows that "=" character was not supported as it should in
the HttpPostRequestDecoder in form-data boundary.

Modifications:
Add 2 methods in StringUtil
- split with maxPart argument: String split with max parts only (to prevent multiple '='
to be source of extra split while not needed)
- substringAfter: String part after delimiter (since first part is not
needed)
Use those methods in HttpPostRequestDecoder.
Change and the HttpPostRequestDecoderTest to check using a boundary
beginning with "=".

Results:
The fix implies more stability and fix the issue.
