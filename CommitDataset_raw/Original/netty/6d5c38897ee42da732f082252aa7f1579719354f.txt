Fix header and initial line length counting

Related: #3445

Motivation:

HttpObjectDecoder.HeaderParser does not reset its counter (the size
field) when it failed to find the end of line.  If a header is split
into multiple fragments, the counter is increased as many times as the
number of fragments, resulting an unexpected TooLongFrameException.

Modifications:

- Add test cases that reproduces the problem
- Reset the HeaderParser.size field when no EOL is found.

Result:

One less bug
