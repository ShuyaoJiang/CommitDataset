[#2604] Not try to use sun.misc.Cleaner when on android

Motivation:

When a user tries to use netty on android it currently fails with "Could not find class 'sun.misc.Cleaner'"

Modification:

Encapsulate sun.misc.Cleaner usage in extra class to workaround this isssue.

Result:
Netty can be used on android again
