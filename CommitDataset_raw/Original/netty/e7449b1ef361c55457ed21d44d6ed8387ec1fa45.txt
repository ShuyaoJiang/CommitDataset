[#5645] Allow to create ByteBuf from existing memory address.

Motivation:

Sometimes it is useful to be able to wrap an existing memory address (a.k.a pointer) and create a ByteBuf from it. This way its easier to interopt with other libraries.

Modifications:

Add a new Unpooled.wrappedBuffer(....) method that takes a memory address.

Result:

Be able to wrap an existing memory address into a ByteBuf.
