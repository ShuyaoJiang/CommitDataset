Don't spin from malformed dns packets containing loops

Motivation:

DNS packets that contain pointers in a loop will cause
DnsResponseDecoder.readName() to infinite loop.

Modifications:

Fixed DnsResponseDecoder.readName() to detect when packets have loops
and return null instead.

Result:

It is no longer possible to cause Netty to infinite loop by sending it malformed
DNS packets with a loop.
