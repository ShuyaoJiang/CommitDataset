Fix unintended timeout in negative DNS lookup cache test

Motivation:

DNS lookups in DnsNameResolverTest can take longer than expected due to
retries. The hard limit of 5 seconds is being applied to
testNegativeTtl(), making the first uncached lookup cause a timeout.

Modifications:

Do not use JUnit's Timeout annotation but implement simple timeout
mechanism that apples only to cached lookups.

Result:

testNegativeTtl() should not fail when an initial negative lookup
requires a retry.
