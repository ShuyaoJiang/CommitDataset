Possible leak in AbstractDiskHttpData

Motivation:
SonarQube (clinker.netty.io/sonar) reported a resource which may not have been properly closed in all situations in AbstractDiskHttpData.

Modifications:
- Ensure file channels are closed in the presence of exceptions.
- Correct instances where local channels were created but potentially not closed.

Result:
Less leaks. Less SonarQube vulnerabilities.
