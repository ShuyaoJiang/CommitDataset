EPOLL include error description and cause in exceptions

Motivation:
EPOLL annotates some exceptions to provide the remote address, but the original exception is not preserved. This may make determining a root cause more difficult. The static EPOLL exceptions references the native method that failed, but does not provide a description of the actual error number. Without the description users have to know intimate details about the native calls and how they may fail to debug issues.

Modifications:
- annotated exceptions should preserve the original exception
- static exceptions should include the string description of the expected errno

Result:
EPOLL exceptions provide more context and are more useful to end users.
