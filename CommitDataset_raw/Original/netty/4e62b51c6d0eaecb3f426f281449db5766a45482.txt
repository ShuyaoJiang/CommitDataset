[#2843] Add test-case to show correct behavior of ByteBuf.refCnt() and ByteBuf.release(...)

Motivation:

We received a bug-report that the ByteBuf.refCnt() does sometimes not show the correct value when release() and refCnt() is called from different Threads.

Modifications:

Add test-case which shows that all is working like expected

Result:

Test-case added which shows everything is ok.
