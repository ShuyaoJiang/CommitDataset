Correctly copy existing elements when CodecOutputList.add(index, element) is called. (#7939)

Motivation:

We did not correctly copy elements in some cases when add(index, element) was used.

Modifications:

- Correctly detect when copy is neede and when not.
- Add test case.

Result:

Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/7938.
