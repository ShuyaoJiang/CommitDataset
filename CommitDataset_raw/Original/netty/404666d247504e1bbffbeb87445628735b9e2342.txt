HTTP/2 ByteBufUtil.writeUtf8 cleanup

Motiviation:
691bc1690e9542d6093b91ffe1fbdf7d075bcd42 made writeUtf8 consistent with String.getBytes() so that it never throws.
94f27be59b637c74763cc3b9fd27cf628b59f7bd provided a writeUtf8 method which takes a ByteBufAllocator to do an appropriately sized buffer allocation.

Result:
- Assume writeUtf8 will not throw in HTTP/2 codec
- Use the new writeUtf8 method

Result:
Cleaner code in codec-http2.
