Add TextHeaders.getAndRemove(...) and its variants

Related issue: #2649 and #2745

Motivation:

At the moment there is no way to get and remove a header with one call.
This means you need to search the headers two times. We should add
getAndRemove(...) to allow doing so with one call.

Modifications:

Add getAndRemove(...) and getUnconvertedAndRemove(...) and their
variants

Result:

More efficient API
