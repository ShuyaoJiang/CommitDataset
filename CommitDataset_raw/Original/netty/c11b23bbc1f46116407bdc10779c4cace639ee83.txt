Close SSLEngine when connection fails.

Motivation:
When using the JdkSslEngine, the ALPN class is used keep a reference
to the engine.   In the event that the TCP connection fails, the
SSLEngine is not removed from the map, creating a memory leak.

Modification:
Always close the SSLEngine regardless of if the channel became
active.  Also, record the SSLEngine was closed in all places.

Result:
Fixes: https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/3080
