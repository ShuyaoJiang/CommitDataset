Issue #60: Make the project multi-module

Split the project into the following modules:
* common
* buffer
* codec
* codec-http
* transport
* transport-*
* handler
* example
* testsuite (integration tests that involve 2+ modules)
* all (does nothing yet, but will make it generate netty.jar)

This commit also fixes the compilation errors with transport-sctp on
non-Linux systems.  It will at least compile without complaints.
