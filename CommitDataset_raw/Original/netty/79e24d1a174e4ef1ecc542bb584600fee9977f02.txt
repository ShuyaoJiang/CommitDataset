Add javadoc warning on SslContext#newHandler client-side

Motivation:

SslContext#newHandler currently creates underlying SSLEngine without
enabling HTTPS endpointIdentificationAlgorithm. This behavior in
unsecured when used on the client side.

We canâ€™t harden the behavior for now, as it would break existing
behavior, for example tests using self signed certificates.

Proper hardening will happen in a future major version when we can
break behavior.

Modifications:

Add javadoc warnings with code snippets.

Result:

Existing unsafe behavior and workaround documented.
