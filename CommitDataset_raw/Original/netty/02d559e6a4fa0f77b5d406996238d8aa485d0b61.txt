Remove flags when running benchmarks. (#8262)

Motivation:

Some of the flags we used are not supported anymore on more recent JDK versions. We should just remove all of them and only keep what we really need. This may also reflect better what people use in production.

Modifications:

Remove some flags when running the benchmarks.

Result:

Benchmarks also run with JDK11.
