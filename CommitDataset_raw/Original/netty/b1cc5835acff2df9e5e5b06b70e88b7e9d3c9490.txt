Not directly call getsockopt but use exported helper function

Motivation:

To better isolate OS system calls we should not call getsockopt directly but use our netty_unix_socket_getOption0 function. See is a followup of f115bf5.

Modifications:

Export netty_unix_socket_getOption0 by declaring it in the header file and use it

Result:

Better isolation of system calls.
