[#5639] Ensure fireChannelActive() is also called if Channel is closed in connect promise.

Motivation:

We need to ensure we also call fireChannelActive() if the Channel is directly closed in a ChannelFutureListener that is belongs to the promise for the connect. Otherwise we will see missing active events.

Modifications:

Ensure we always call fireChannelActive() if the Channel was active.

Result:

No missing events.
