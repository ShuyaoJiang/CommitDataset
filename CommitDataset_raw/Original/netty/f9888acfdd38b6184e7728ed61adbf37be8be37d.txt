added overloaded method to the DefaultChannelPipeline in order to avoid unnecessary allocation

Motivation :

Avoid unnecessary array allocation when using the function with varargs in the DefaultChannelPipeline class.

Modifications :

Added addLast and addFirst overloaded methods with 1 handler instead of varargs.

Result :

No array allocation when using simple construction like pipeline.addLast(new Handler());
