HTTP/2 HelloWorld clear text NPE

Motivation:
HelloWorldHttp2Handler throws a NPE when converting from HTTP/1.x headers to HTTP/2 headers because there is no Host header.

Modifications:
- HelloWorldHttp2Handler should check if the Host header is present before setting it in the HTTP/2 headers

Result:
No more NPE in HelloWorldHttp2Handler.
