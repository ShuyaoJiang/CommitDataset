Change the operator order of TrafficCounter to calculate the throughput to get the correct result

Motivation:
Currently the last read/write throughput is calculated by first division,this will be 0 if the last read/write bytes < interval,change the order will get the correct result

Modifications:
Change the operator order from first do division to multiplication

Result:
Get the correct result instead of 0 when bytes are smaller than interval
