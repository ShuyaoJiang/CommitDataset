Log more details if notification of promise fails in PromiseNotifier and AbstractChannelHandlerContext

Motivation:

To make it easier to debug why notification of a promise failed we should log extra info and make it consistent.

Modifications:

- Create a new PromiseNotificationUtil that has static methods that can be used to try notify a promise and log.
- Reuse this in AbstractChannelHandlerContext, ChannelOutboundBuffer and PromiseNotifier

Result:

Easier to debug why a promise could not be notified.
