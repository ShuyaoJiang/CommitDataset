Use ByteBuf.*LE methods for write and read LE

Motivation:

We recently added methods to ByteBuf to directly write and read LE values. We should use these in the Snappy implementation and so reduce duplication.

Modifications:

Replace manually swapping of values with LE write and read methods of ByteBuf.

Result:

Cleaner code with less duplication.
