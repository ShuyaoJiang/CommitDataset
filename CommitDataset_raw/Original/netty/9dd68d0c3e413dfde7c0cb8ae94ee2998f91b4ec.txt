Fix IllegalReferenceCountException caused by HttpClientCodec.upgradeFrom()

Motivation:

On a successful protocol upgrade in HTTP, HttpClientUpgradeHandler calls
HttpClientCodec.upgradeFrom(), which removed both the HTTP encoder and
decoder from the pipeline immediately.

However, because the decoder is in the middle of the decode loop,
removing it from the pipeline immediately will cause the cumulation
buffer to be released prematurely.

This often leads to an IllegalReferenceCountException or missing first
response after the upgrade response.

Modifications:

- Remove the decoder *after* the decode loop is done

Result:

Fixes #4504
