Document the contract of Attribute.getAndSet(...) and set(...)

Motivation:

Attribute.getAndRemove() will return the value but also remove the AttributeKey itself from the AttributeMap. This may not
what you want as you may want to keep an instance of it and just set it later again. Document the contract so the user know what to expect.

Modifications:

- Make it clear when to use AttributeKey.getAndRemove() / AttributeKey.remove() and when AttributeKey.getAndSet(null) / AttributeKey.set(null).

Result:

Less suprising behaviour.
