DnsNameResolverContext reuse of DnsServerAddressStream without duplicate

Motivation:
DnsServerAddressStream provides an iterator like interface but maybe expected to start at a specific point upon each new usage. If a DnsServerAddressStream is re-used in multiple independent iterations the order of iteration maybe incorrect. DnsNameResolverContext has a fallback DnsServerAddressStream reference if the cache doesn't contain a hit, but it is shared across multiple independent iterations. This may lead to undesirable DNS query order.

Modifications:
- DnsNameResolverContext#getNameServers should duplicate the default DnsServerAddressStream

Result:
Consistent iteration over the default DnsServerAddressStream in DnsNameResolverContext.
