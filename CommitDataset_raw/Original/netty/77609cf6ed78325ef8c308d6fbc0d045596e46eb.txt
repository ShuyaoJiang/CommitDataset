Fix a bug where AbstractConstant.compareTo() returns 0 for different constants

Related issue: #2354

Motivation:

AbstractConstant.compareTo() can return 0 even if the specified constant
object is not the same instance with 'this'.

Modifications:

- Compare the identityHashCode of constant first. If that fails,
  allocate a small direct buffer and use its memory address as a unique
  value.  If the platform does not provide a way to get the memory
  address of a direct buffer, use a thread-local random value.
- Signal cannot extend AbstractConstant. Use delegation.

Result:

It is practically impossible for AbstractConstant.compareTo() to return
0 for different constant objects.
