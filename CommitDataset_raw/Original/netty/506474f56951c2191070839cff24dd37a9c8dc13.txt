Overhaul pipeline implementation for clarity and memory efficiency

This pull request cleans up our pipeline implementation by moving most
inter-context traversal code to DefaultChannelHandlerContext.
Previously, outbound traversal was done in DefaultChannelPipeline while
inbound traversal was done in DefaultChannelHandlerContext.

Also, to address the memory inefficiency issue raised in #920, all
runnables are lazily instantiated.
