Epoll and Kqueue shouldn't read by default (#8024)

Motivation:
Epoll and Kqueue channels have internal state which forces
a single read operation after channel construction. This
violates the Channel#read() interface which indicates that
data shouldn't be delivered until this method is called.
The behavior is also inconsistent with the NIO transport.

Modifications:
- Epoll and Kqueue shouldn't unconditionally read upon
initialization, and instead should rely upon Channel#read()
or auto_read.

Result:
Epoll and Kqueue are more consistent with NIO.
