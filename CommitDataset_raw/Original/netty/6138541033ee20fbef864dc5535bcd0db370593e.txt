Avoid repeating the same field and hiding it (#8335)

Motivation

The EpollChannelConfig (same for KQueues) and its subclasses repeatetly declare their own channel field which leads to a 3x repetition for each config instance. Given the fields are protected or package-private it's exposing the code code to "field hiding" bugs.

Modifications

Use the the existing protected channel field from the DefaultChannelConfig class and simply cast it when needed.

Result

Fixes #8331
