OpenSslEngine remove unecessary rejectRemoteInitiatedRenegation call

Motivation:
OpenSslEngine calls rejectRemoteInitiatedRenegation in a scenario where the number of handshakes has not been observed to change. The number of handshakes has only been observed to change after readPlaintextData is called.

Modifications:
- Remove the call to rejectRemoteInitiatedRenegation before calls to readPlaintextData

Result:
Less code.
