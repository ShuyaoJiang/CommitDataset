Cleanup ChannelId handling of basic methods

Motiviation:

Simplify implementation of compareTo/equals/hashCode for ChannelIds.

Modifications:

We simplfy the hashCode implementation for DefaultChannelId by not
making it random, but making it based on the underlying data. We fix the
compareTo implementation for DefaultChannelId by using lexicographic
comparison of the underlying data array. We fix the compareTo
implementation for CustomChannelId to avoid the possibility of overflow.

Result:

Cleaner code that is easier to maintain.
