Moving KObjectHashMapTest to propert directory

Motivation:

The KObjectHashMapTest is in a directory called "io.netty.util.collection" rather than "io/netty/util/collection". This causes the generated tests to be created in the wrong directory as well.

Modifications:

Moved the file.

Result:

Fixes #4546
