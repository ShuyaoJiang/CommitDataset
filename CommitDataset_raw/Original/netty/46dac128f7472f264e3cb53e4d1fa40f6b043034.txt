Http2FrameCodec WindowUpdate bug

Motivation:
Http2FrameCodec increases the initialWindowSize when the user attempts to increase the connection flow control window. The initialWindowSize should only be touched as a result of a SETTINGS frame, and otherwise may result in flow control getting out of sync with our peer.

Modifications:
- Http2FrameCodec shouldn't update the initialWindowSize when a WindowUpdateFrame is written on the connection channel

Result:
More correct WindowUpdate processing.
