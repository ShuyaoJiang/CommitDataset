Fix unbounded expansion of cumulative buffer in SslHandler

Related: #3567

Motivation:

SslHandler.channelReadComplete() forgets to call
super.channelReadComplete(), which discards read bytes from the
cumulative buffer.  As a result, the cumulative buffer can expand its
capacity unboundedly.

Modifications:

Call super.channelReadComplete() instead of calling
ctx.fireChannelReadComplete()

Result:

Fixes #3567
