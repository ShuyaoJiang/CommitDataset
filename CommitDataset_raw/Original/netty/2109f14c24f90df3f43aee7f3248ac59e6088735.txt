When running our testsuite with netty-tcnative-boringssl-static we should use an empty classifier. (#8396)

Motivation:

We publish an "uber-jar" for netty-tcnative-boringssl-static so we should use it when testing against boringssl.

Modifications:

Ensure we use empty classifier.

Result:

Use uber-jar when testing
