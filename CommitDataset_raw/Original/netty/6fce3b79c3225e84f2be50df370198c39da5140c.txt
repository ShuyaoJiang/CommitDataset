Do not try to init TrustManagerFactory if trustCertChainFile is null.

Motivation:

We called TrustManagerFactory.init(...) even when the trustCertChainFile is null. This could lead to exceptions during the handshake.

Modifications:

Correctly only call TurstManagerFactory.init() if trustCertcChainFail is not null.

Result:

Correct behavior.
