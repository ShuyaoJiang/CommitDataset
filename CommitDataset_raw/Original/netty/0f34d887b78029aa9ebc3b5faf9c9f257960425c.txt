Only reset readIsPending if outboundBuffer is not empty. (#7874)

Motivation:

We need to ensure we only reset readInProgress if the outboundBuffer is not empty as otherwise we may miss to call fireChannelRead(...) later on when using the LocalChannel.

Modifications:

Also check if the outboundBuffer is not empty before setting readInProgress to false again

Result:

Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/7855
