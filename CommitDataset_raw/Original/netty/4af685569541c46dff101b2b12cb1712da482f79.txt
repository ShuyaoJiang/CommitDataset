Remove @Deprecated for primitive WriteWaterMark getters and setters

Motivation:

For use cases that demand frequent updates of the write watermarks, an
API that requires immutable WriteWaterMark objects is not ideal, as it
implies a lot of object allocation.

For example, the HTTP/2 child channel API uses write watermarks for outbound
flow control and updates the write watermarks on every DATA frame write.

Modifications:

Remote @Deprecated tag from primitive getters and setters, however the corresponding
channel options remain deprecated.

Result:

Primitive getters and setters for write watermarks are no longer marked @Deprecated.
