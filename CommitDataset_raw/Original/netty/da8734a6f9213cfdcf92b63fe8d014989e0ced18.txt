codec-http2: Mark requests as chunked in Http2ServerDowngrader

Motivation:

Http2ServerDowngrader doesn't mark chunked requests as chunked, even
though the natural conversion from http/2 requests to http/1.1 requests
is to chunked ones.

Modifications:

Mark requests that aren't already complete as chunked.

Result:

Requests will be chunked, and can later be aggregated if necessary.
