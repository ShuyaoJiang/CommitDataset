Add a pax-exam based OSGi test suite

Motivation:

Release 4.0.25 was not usable in OSGi environments due to a simple typo.
An automated test could have caught the problem even before it was
committed.

Modifications:

This patch introduces a new artifact, osgitests, which pulls in all
production artifacts (which we want to be checked for OSGi compliance).
It contains only a single unit test, which runs a pax-exam container
with felix OSGi.

At initialization time, it scans all the artifact's dependencies,
looking for things belonging to io.netty group. The container is
configured to deploy those artifacts as bundles and fail if any bundle
is found to be unresolved. It performs a final check to see if any
bundles were tested this way, to make sure the mechanism is not
completely broken.

We are using wrappedBundle(), as two of our third-party dependencies do
not export packages correctly -- this masks the problem, assuming that
whoever deploys our artifacts depending on them will figure out how to
OSGify them.

Result:

Simple typos and other bundle manifest errors should be caught during
test phase of every build.
