RecvByteBufAllocator.DelegatingHandle accessor

Motivation:
RecvByteBufAllocator.DelegatingHandle does not provide an accessor to get the delegate handle. This may be useful for classes that extend DelegatingHandle.

Modifications:
- add delegate() method to DelegatingHandle

Result:
Classes which inherit from DelegatingHandle can now access the delegate Handle.
