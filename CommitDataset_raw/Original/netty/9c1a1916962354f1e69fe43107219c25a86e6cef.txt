Trim optional white space in CombinedHttpHeaders values

Motivation:

The updated HTTP/1.x RFC allows for header values to be CSV and separated by OWS [1]. CombinedHttpHeaders should remove this OWS on insertion.

[1] https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-7

Modification:

CombinedHttpHeaders doesn't account for the OWS and returns it back to the user as part of the value.

Result:

Fixes #6452
