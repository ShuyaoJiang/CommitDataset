Correctly handle unsigned int values returned from TCP_INFO

Motivation:

We used an int[] to store all values that are returned in the struct for TCP_INFO which is not good enough as it uses usigned int values.

Modifications:

- Change int[] to long[] and correctly cast values.

Result:

No more truncated values.
