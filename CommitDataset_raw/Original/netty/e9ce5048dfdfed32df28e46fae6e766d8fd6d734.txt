Correctly produce ssl alert when certificate validation fails on the client-side when using native SSL implementation. (#8949)

Motivation:

When the verification of the server cert fails because of the used TrustManager on the client-side we need to ensure we produce the correct alert and send it to the remote peer before closing the connection.

Modifications:

- Use the correct verification mode on the client-side by default.
- Update tests

Result:

Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/8942.
