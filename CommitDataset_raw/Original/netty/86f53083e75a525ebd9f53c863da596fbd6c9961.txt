[#5297] Ensure calling NioEventLoop.pendingTasks() and EpollEventLoop.pendingTasks() will not produce livelock

Motivation:

SingleThreadEventExecutor.pendingTasks() will call taskQueue.size() to get the number of pending tasks in the queue. This is not safe when using MpscLinkedQueue as size() is only allowed to be called by a single consumer.

Modifications:

Ensure size() is only called from the EventLoop.

Result:

No more livelock possible when call pendingTasks, no matter from which thread it is done.
