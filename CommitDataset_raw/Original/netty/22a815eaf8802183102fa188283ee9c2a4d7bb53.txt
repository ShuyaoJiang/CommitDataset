Revamp channel handler API

- Merged LifeCycleAwareChannelHandler into ChannelHandler
- Replaced ChannelUpstreamHandler and ChannelDownstreamHandler with
  ChannelReader and ChannelWriter
  - These two new interfaces are much more type-safe than its ancestor.
- Simplified channel state model as described in #68
- Handler creates send/receive buffer.
  - Previously, Netty created them, but it led to more memory copies and
    inflexibility.  I'm going to allow a handler to create a bounded
    queue for example.
  - It currently uses Queue<T> but I'll define a new interface and make
    ChannelBuffer implement it (e.g. Queue<Byte>)
- Introduced AttributeMap which replaces attachments in Channel and
  ChannelHandlerContext and ChannelLocal
