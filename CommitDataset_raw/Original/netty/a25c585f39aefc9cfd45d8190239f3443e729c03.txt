Fix overriden method not called in TrafficShaping

Motivation:
handlerAdded and handlerRemoved were overriden but super was never
called, while it should.
Also add one missing information in the toString method.

Modifications:
Add the super corresponding call, and add checkInterval to the
toString() method

Result;
super method calls are correctly passed to the super implementation
part.
