SwappedByteBuf.unwrap() should return wrapped buffer.

Motivation:

SwappedByteBuf.unwrap() not returned the wrapped buffer but the buffer that was wrapped by the original buffer. This is not correct.

Modifications:

Correctly return wrapped buffer and fix test.

Result:

SwappedByteBuf.unwrap() works as expected.
