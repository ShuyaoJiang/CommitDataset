Remove HpackDecoder.maxHeaderListSizeGoAway (#7911)

Motivation:

When a sender sends too large of headers it should not unnecessarily
kill the connection, as killing the connection is a heavy-handed
solution while SETTINGS_MAX_HEADER_LIST_SIZE is advisory and may be
ignored.

The maxHeaderListSizeGoAway limit in HpackDecoder is unnecessary because
any headers causing the list to exceeding the max size can simply be
thrown away. In addition, DefaultHttp2FrameReader.HeadersBlockBuilder
limits the entire block to maxHeaderListSizeGoAway. Thus individual
literals are limited to maxHeaderListSizeGoAway.

(Technically, literals are limited to 1.6x maxHeaderListSizeGoAway,
since the canonical Huffman code has a maximum compression ratio of
.625. However, the "unnecessary" limit in HpackDecoder was also being
applied to compressed sizes.)

Modifications:

Remove maxHeaderListSizeGoAway checking in HpackDecoder and instead
eagerly throw away any headers causing the list to exceed
maxHeaderListSize.

Result:

Fewer large header cases will trigger connection-killing.
DefaultHttp2FrameReader.HeadersBlockBuilder will still kill the
connection when maxHeaderListSizeGoAway is exceeded, however.
