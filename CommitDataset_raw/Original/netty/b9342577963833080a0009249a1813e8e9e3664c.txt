[#3784] Support hostname verification when using OpenSSLEngine

Motivation:

At the moment hostname verification is not supported with OpenSSLEngine.

Modifications:

- Allow to create OpenSslEngine with peerHost and peerPort informations.
- Respect endPointIdentificationAlgorithm and algorithmConstraints when set and get SSLParamaters.

Result:

hostname verification is supported now.
