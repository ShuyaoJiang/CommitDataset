Respect ClientAuth set via OpenSslEngine constructor

Motivation:

When ClientAuth is set via SslContextBuilder we pass it into the OpenSslEngine constructor. Due a bug we missed to call the correct native methods and so never enabled ClientAuth in this case.

Modifications:

Correctly call setClientAuth(...) in the constructor if needed.

Result:

client auth also works when configured via the SslContextBuilder and OPENSSL is used.
