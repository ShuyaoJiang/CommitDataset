DnsNameResovlerContext#followCname sending extra queries

Motivation:
When following a CNAME response DnsNameResovlerContext may issue a A and AAAA query. However the DnsNameResolverContext would have already issued a A and AAAA query to get the CNAME response, and this may result in 2 additional A/AAAA queries per CNAME response.

Modifications:
- DnsNameResovlerContext#followCname shouldn't issue 2 queries, but instead just a single query with the same record type as the original query

Result:
No more duplicate queries as a result of CNAME responses.
