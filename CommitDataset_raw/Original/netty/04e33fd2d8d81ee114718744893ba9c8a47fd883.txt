NioEventLoop closes channel even if channel is not registered

Motivation:
If a channel is deregistered from an NioEventLoop the associated SelectionKey is cancelled. If the NioEventLoop has yet to process a pending event as a result of that SelectionKey then the NioEventLoop will see the SelecitonKey is invalid and close the channel. The NioEventLoop should not close a channel if it is not registered with that NioEventLoop.

Modifications:
- NioEventLoop.processSelectedKeys should check that the channel is still registered to itself before closing the channel

Result:
NioEventLoop doesn't close a channel that is no longer registered to it when the SelectionKey is invalid
