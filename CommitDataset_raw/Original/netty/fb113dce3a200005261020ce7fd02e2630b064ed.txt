HttpPostRequestEncoder may return a slice which is not retained.

Motivation:

We miss to retain a slice before return it to the user and so an reference count error may accour later on.

Modifications:

Use readRetainedSlice(...) and so ensure we retain the buffer before hand it of to the user.

Result:

Fixes [#6626].
