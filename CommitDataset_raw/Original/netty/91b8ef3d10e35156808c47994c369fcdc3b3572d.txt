HTTP/2 PriorityStreamByteDistributor exceptions and reentry

Motivation:
PriorityStreamByteDistributor saves exception state and attempts to reset state. This could be simplified by just throwing a connection error and closing the connection. PriorityStreamByteDistributor also does not handle or detect re-entry in the distribute method.

Motivation:
- PriorityStreamByteDistributor propagate an INTERNAL_ERROR if an exception occurs during writing
- PriorityStreamByteDistributor to handle re-entry on the write method

Result:
PriorityStreamByteDistributor exception code state simplified, and re-entry is detected.
