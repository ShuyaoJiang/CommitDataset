OioSctpChannel iterating over selected keys

Motivation:
OioSctpChannel.doReadMessages is iterating over the selected keys, and ignoring each selected key. It is not known why this is needed and no other channel implementation does this.

Modifications:
- Stop iterating over selected keys, and just read like other channels

Result:
No unnecessary iteration in OioSctpChannel.doReadMessages.
