Epoll.isAvailable() must return false if sun.misc.Unsafe is not present.

Motivation:

Currently our epoll native transport requires sun.misc.Unsafe and so we need to take this into account for Epoll.isAvailable().

Modifications:

Take into account if sun.misc.Unsafe is present.

Result:

Only return true for Epoll.isAvailable() if sun.misc.Unsafe is present.
