HTTP/2 codec heap buffer usage

Motivation:
The HTTP/2 codec has a few static buffers sent over the network which are allocated on the heap. This results in a copy operation when the buffer is sent out on the network.

Modifications:
- Ensure these static buffers are allocated using direct memory.

Result:
No copy operation necessary when writing static buffers to network.
