PlatformDependent static initialization ExceptionInInitializerError

Motivation:
PlatformDependent allows some exceptions to escape during static initialization. If an exception escapes it will be translated into a java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError and render the application unable to run.

Modifications:
- Make sure to catch Throwable during static initialization.

Result:
PlatformDependent static initialization doesn't result in java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError.
