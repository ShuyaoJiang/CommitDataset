[#4110] Correct javadocs of MpscLinkedQueue

Motivation:

The javadocs are incorrect and so give false impressions of use-pattern.

Modifications:

- Fix javadocs of which operations are allowed from multiple threads concurrently.
- Let isEmpty() work concurrently.

Result:

Correctly document usage-patterns.
