SslHandler should call beginHanshake once for the initial handshake

Motivation:
Not all SSLEngine implementations permit beginHandshake being called while a handshake is in progress during the initial handshake. We should ensure we only go through the initial handshake code once to prevent unexpected exceptions from being thrown.

Modifications:
- Only call beginHandshake if there is not currently a handshake in progress

Result:
SslHandler's handshake method is compatible with OpenSSLEngineImpl in Android 5.0+ and 6.0+.
