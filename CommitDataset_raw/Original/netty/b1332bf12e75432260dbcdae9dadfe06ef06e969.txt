NativeLibraryLoader logging clarify

Motivation:
NativeLibraryLoader may only log a debug statement if the library is successfully loaded from java.library.path, but will log failure statements the if load for java.library.path fails which can mislead users to believe the load actually failed when it may have succeeded.

Modifications:
- Always load a debug statement when a library was successfully loaded

Result:
NativeLibraryLoader log statements more clear.
