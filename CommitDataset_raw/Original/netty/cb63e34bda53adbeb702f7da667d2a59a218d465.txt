Removing unnecessary sort in remote flow controller.

Motivation:

The DefaultHttp2RemoteFlowController's priority algorithm doesn't really need to sort the children by weight since it already fairly distributes data based on weight.

Modifications:

Removing the sorting in the priority algorithm and updating one test to allow a small bit of variability in the results.

Result:

Slight improvement on the performance of the priority algorithm.
