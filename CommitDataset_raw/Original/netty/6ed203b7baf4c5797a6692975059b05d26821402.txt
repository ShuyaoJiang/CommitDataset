NioServerSocketChannel.isActive() must return false after close() completes. (#9030)

Motivation:

When a Channel was closed its isActive() method must return false.

Modifications:

First check for isOpen() before isBound() as isBound() will continue to return true even after the underyling fd was closed.

Result:

Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/9026.
