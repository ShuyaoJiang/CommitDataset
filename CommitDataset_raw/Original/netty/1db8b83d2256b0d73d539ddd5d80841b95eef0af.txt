Cater for empty response bodies when performing response compression.

Motivation:
RFC 2616, 4.3 Message Body states that:
All 1xx (informational), 204 (no content), and 304 (not modified) responses MUST NOT include a
message-body. All other responses do include a message-body, although it MAY be of zero length.

Modifications:
HttpContentEncoder was previously modified to cater for HTTP 100 responses. This check is enhanced to
include HTTP 204 and 304 responses.

Result:
Empty response bodies will not be modified to include the compression footer. This footer messed with Chrome's
response parsing leading to "hanging" requests.
