[#5372] Ensure OpenSslClientContext / OpenSslServerContext can be garbage collected

Motivation:

OpenSslClientContext / OpenSslServerContext can never be garbage collected as both are part of a reference to a callback that is stored as global reference in jni code.

Modifications:

Ensure the callbacks are static and so not hold the reference.

Result:

No more leak due not collectable OpenSslClientContext / OpenSslServerContext
