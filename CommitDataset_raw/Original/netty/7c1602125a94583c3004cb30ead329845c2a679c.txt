Builder to construct DomainNameMapping.

Motivation:

DomainNameMapping.add() makes DomainNameMapping look like it's safe to call add() anytime, and this is never true. It's probably better deprecate add() and introduce DomainNameMappingBuilder.

Modifications:

Made an immutable implementation of DomainNameMapping;
Added Builder for immutable DomainNameMapping;
Replaced regex pattern with String::startsWith check;
Replaced HashMap with two arrays in ImmutableDomainNameMapping;
Deprecated mutable API;
Estimation for StringBuilder initial size in ImmutableDomainNameMapping#toString()
Added StringUtil#commonSuffixOfLength
Replaced unnecessary substrings creation in DomainNameMapping#matches with regionMatches

Result:

Clients will be able to create immutable instances of DomainNameMapping with builder API.
