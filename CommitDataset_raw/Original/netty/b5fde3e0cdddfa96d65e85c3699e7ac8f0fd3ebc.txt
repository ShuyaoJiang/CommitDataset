Add #ifdef statements so the compilation of the native code not fails on MacOS (#7895)

Motivation:

b818852cdb0ee56ce3cf939e2faa538d519baabd added support for IP_RECVORIGDSTADDR but did not include any #ifdef statements to ensure its usable at all (which is not the case on MacOS).

Modifications:

Add #ifdef statements to check for IP_RECVORIGDSTADDR.

Result:

Compilation works again on MacOS.
