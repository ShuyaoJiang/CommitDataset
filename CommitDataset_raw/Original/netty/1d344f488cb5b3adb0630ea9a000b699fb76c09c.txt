Fix ByteBufUtilBenchmark on utf8 encodings.

Motivation
----------
The performance tests for utf8 also used the getBytes on ASCII,
which is incorrect and also provides different performance numbers.

Modifications
-------------
Use CharsetUtil.UTF_8 instead of US_ASCII for the getBytes calls.

Result
------
Accurate and semantically correct benchmarking results on utf8
comparisons.
