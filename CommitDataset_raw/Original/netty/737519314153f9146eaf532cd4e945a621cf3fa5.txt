Don't update state of PromiseCombiner when finish(null) is called (#8843)

Motivation:

When we fail a call to PromiseCombiner.finish(...) because of a null argument we must not update the internal state before throwing.

Modifications:

- First do the null check and only after we validated that the argument is not null update the internal state
- Add test case.

Modifications:

Do not mess up internal state of PromiseCombiner when finish(...) is called with a null argument.

Result:

After your change, what will change.
