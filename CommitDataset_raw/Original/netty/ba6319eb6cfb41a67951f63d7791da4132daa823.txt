Fix FixedCompositeByteBuf handling when copying to direct buffers and streams

Motivation:

FixedCompositeByteBuf does not properly implement a number of methods for
copying its content to direct buffers and output streams

Modifications:

Replace improper use of capacity() with readableBytes() when computing offesets during writes

Result:

Copying works correctly
