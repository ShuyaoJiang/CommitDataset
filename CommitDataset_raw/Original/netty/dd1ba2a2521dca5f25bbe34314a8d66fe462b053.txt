HttpObjectDecoder resetRequested not updated after reset

Motivation:
HttpObjectDecoder maintains a resetRequested flag which is used to determine if internal state should be reset when a decode occurs. However after a reset is done the resetRequested flag is not set to false. This leads to all data after this point being discarded.

Modifications:
- Set resetRequested to false when a reset is done

Result:
HttpObjectDecoder can still function after a reset.
