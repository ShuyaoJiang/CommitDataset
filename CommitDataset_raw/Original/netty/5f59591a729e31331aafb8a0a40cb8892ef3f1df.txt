Fix sporadic assertion failure in SingleThreadEventLoopTest

Motivation:

SingleThreadEventLoopTest.testScheduleTaskAtFixedRate() fails often due to:

- too little tolerance
- incorrect assertion (it compares only with the previous timestamp)

Modifications:

- Increase the timestamp difference tolerance from 10ms to 20ms
- Improve the timestamp assertion so that the comparison is performed against the first recorded timestamp
- Misc: Fix broken Javadoc tag

Result:

More build stability
