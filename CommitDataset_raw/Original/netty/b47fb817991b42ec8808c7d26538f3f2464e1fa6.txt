EventLoop.schedule with big delay fails (#7402)

Motivation:

Using a very huge delay when calling schedule(...) may cause an Selector error when calling select(...) later on. We should gaurd against such a big value.

Modifications:

- Add guard against a very huge value.
- Added tests.

Result:

Fixes [#7365]
