Don't trigger IOException at ChunkedStream.isEndOfInput()

Related: #3368

Motivation:

ChunkedWriteHandler checks if the return value of
ChunkedInput.isEndOfInput() after calling ChunkedInput.close().

This makes ChunkedStream.isEndOfInput() trigger an IOException, which is
originally triggered by PushBackInputStream.read().

By contract, ChunkedInput.isEndOfInput() should not raise an IOException
even when the underlying stream is closed.

Modifications:

Add a boolean flag that keeps track of whether the underlying stream has
been closed or not, so that ChunkedStream.isEndOfInput() does not
propagate the IOException from PushBackInputStream.

Result:

Fixes #3368
