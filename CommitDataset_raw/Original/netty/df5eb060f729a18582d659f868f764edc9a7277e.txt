Only handle NXDOMAIN as failure when nameserver is authoritive or no other nameservers are left. (#8731)

Motivation:

When using multiple nameservers and a nameserver respond with NXDOMAIN we should only fail the query if the nameserver in question is authoritive or no nameservers are left to try.

Modifications:

- Try next nameserver if NXDOMAIN was returned but the nameserver is not authoritive
- Adjust testcase to respect correct behaviour.

Result:

Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/8261
