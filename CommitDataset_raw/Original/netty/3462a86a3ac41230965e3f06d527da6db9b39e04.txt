Ensure we release the previous retained AddressedEnvelope when we fail to notify the promise.

Motivation:

We need to ensure we release the AddressedEnvelope if we fail to notify the future (as it may be notified before because of an timeout). Otherwise we may leak.

Modifications:

Call release() if we fail to notify the future.

Result:

No more memory leak on notify failure.
