ReadOnlyHttpHeaders

Motivation:
For use cases that create headers, but do not need to modify them a read only variant of HttpHeaders would be useful and may be able to provide better iteration performance for encoding.

Modifications:
- Introduce ReadOnlyHttpHeaders that is backed by a flat array

Result:
ReadOnlyHttpHeaders exists for non-modifiable HttpHeaders use cases.
