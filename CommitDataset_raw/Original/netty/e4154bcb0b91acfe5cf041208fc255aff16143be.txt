[#5720] Static initializers can cause deadlock

Motivation:

SystemPropertyUtil requires InternalLoggerFactory requires ThreadLocalRandom requires SystemPropertyUtil. This can lead to a dead-lock.

Modifications:

Ensure ThreadLocalRandom does not require SystemPropertyUtil during initialization.

Result:

No more deadlock possible.
