[#2370] Periodically check for not alive Threads and free up their ThreadPoolCache

Motivation:
At the moment we create new ThreadPoolCache whenever a Thread tries either allocate or release something on the PooledByteBufAllocator. When something is released we put it then in its ThreadPoolCache. The problem is we never check if a Thread is not alive anymore and so we may end up with memory that is never freed again if a user create many short living Threads that use the PooledByteBufAllocator.

Modifications:
Periodically check if the Thread is still alive that has a ThreadPoolCache assinged and if not free it.

Result:
Memory is freed up correctly even for short living Threads.
