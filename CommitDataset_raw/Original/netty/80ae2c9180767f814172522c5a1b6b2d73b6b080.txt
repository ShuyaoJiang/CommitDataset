Add a test for handover from HTTP to Websocket

Motivation:
I was not fully reassured that whether everything works correctly when a websocket client receives the websocket handshake HTTP response and a websocket frame in a single ByteBuf (which can happen when the server sends a response directly or shortly after the connect). In this case some parts of the ByteBuf must be processed by HTTP decoder and the remaining by the websocket decoder.

Modification:
Adding a test that verifies that in this scenaria the handshake and the message are correctly interpreted and delivered by Netty.

Result:
One more test for Netty.
The test succeeds - No problems
