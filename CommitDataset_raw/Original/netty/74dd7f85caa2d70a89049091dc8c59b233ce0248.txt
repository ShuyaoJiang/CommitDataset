HTTP/2 Thread Context Interface Clarifications

Motivation:
It is currently assumed that all usages of the HTTP/2 codec will be from the same event loop context. If the methods are used outside of the assumed thread context then unexpected behavior is observed. This assumption should be more clearly communicated and enforced in key areas.

Modifications:
- The flow controller interfaces have assert statements and updated javadocs indicating the assumptions.

Result:
Interfaces more clearly indicate thread context limitations.
