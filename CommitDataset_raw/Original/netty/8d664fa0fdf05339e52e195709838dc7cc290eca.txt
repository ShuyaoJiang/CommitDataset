Include frame-pointer to improve epoll flamegraph tracing

Motivation:

When attempting to flamegraph netty w/ epoll it was noticed the stacks are lost going from
java to epoll lib.

Modifications:

added the -fno-omit-framepointer flag to compiler flags to ensure the fp is kept intact

Result:

Flamegraphs will now show native code in the same stack as java code using perf-java-flames
