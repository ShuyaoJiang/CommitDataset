AggregatedFullHttpMessage.replace should also copy a decoder result

Motivation:

HttpObjectAggregator yields full HTTP messgaes (AggregatedFullHttpMessages) that don't respect decoder result when copied/replaced.

Modifications:

Copy the decoding result over to a new instance produced by AggregatedFullHttpRequest.replace or AggregatedFullHttpResponse.replace .

Result:

DecoderResult is now copied over when an original AggregatedFullHttpMessage is being replaced (i.e., AggregatedFullHttpRequest.replace or AggregatedFullHttpResponse.replace is being called).

New unit tests are passing on this branch but are failing on master.
