EmptyByteBuf allows writing ByteBufs with 0 readable bytes

Motivation:

The contract of `ByteBuf.writeBytes(ByteBuf src)` is such that it will
throw an `IndexOutOfBoundsException if `src.readableBytes()` is greater than
`this.writableBytes()`. The EmptyByteBuf class will throw the exception,
even if the source buffer has zero readable bytes, in violation of the
contract.

Modifications:

Use the helper method `checkLength(..)` to check the length and throw
the exception, if appropriate.

Result:

Conformance with the stated behavior of ByteBuf.
