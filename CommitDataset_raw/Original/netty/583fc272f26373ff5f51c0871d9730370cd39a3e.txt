Fixed|SimpleChannelPool.close() should only return after complete. (#7927)

Motivation:

We need to ensure we only return from close() after all work is done as otherwise we may close the EventExecutor before we dispatched everything.

Modifications:

Correctly wait on operations to complete before return.

Result:

Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/7901.
