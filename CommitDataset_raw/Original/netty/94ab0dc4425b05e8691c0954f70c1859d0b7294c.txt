codec-http2: Better keep track of nameLength in HpackDecoder.decode

Motivation:

http/2 counts header sizes somewhat inconsistently.  Sometimes, headers
which are substantively less than the header list size will be measured
as longer than the header list size.

Modifications:

Keep better track of the nameLength of a given name, so that we don't
accidentally end up reusing a nameLength.

Result:

More consistent measurement of header list size.

Fixes #7511.
