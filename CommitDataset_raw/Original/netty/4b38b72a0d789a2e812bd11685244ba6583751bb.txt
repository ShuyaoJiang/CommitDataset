Fix incorrect name encoding/decoding in DNS records

Motivation:

- The decoded name should always end with a dot (.), but we currently
  strip it, which is incorrect.
  - (O) 0 -> "."
  - (X) 0 -> ""
  - (O) 5 netty 2 io 0 -> "netty.io."
  - (X) 5 netty 2 io 0 -> "netty.io"
- The encoded name should end with a null-label, which is a label whose
  length is 0, but we currently append an extra NUL, causing FORMERR(1)
  on a strict DNS server:
  - (O) . -> 0
  - (X) . -> 0 0
  - (O) netty.io. -> 5 netty 2 io 0
  - (X) netty.io. -> 5 netty 2 io 0 0

Modifications:

- Make sure to append '.' when decoding a name.
- Improve index checks so that the decoder can raise
  CorruptFrameException instead of IIOBE
- Do not encode extra NUL
- Add more tests

Result:

Robustness and correctness
