Correctly support SSLSession.getId() when using OpenSslEngine

Motivation:

At the moment SSLSession.getId() may always return an empty byte array when OpenSSLEngine is used. This is as we not set SSL_OP_NO_TICKET on the SSLContext and so SSL_SESSION_get_id(...) will return an session id with length of 0 if tickets are not used.

Modifications:

- Set SSL_OP_NO_TICKET by default and only clear it if the user requests the usage of session tickets.
- Add unit test

Result:

Ensure consistent behavior between different SSLEngine implementations.
