Handle partially decoded elements while streaming Json array

Motivation:

'insideString' and 'openBraces' need a proper handling when streaming
Json array over multiple writes and an element decoding was started but
not completed.
Related to #6969

Modifications:

If the idx is reset:
- 'insideString' has to be reset to 'false' in order to indicate that
  array element will be decoded from the beginning
- 'openBraces' has to be reset to '1' to indicate that Json array
  decoding is in progress.

Result:
Json array is properly decoded when in streaming mode
