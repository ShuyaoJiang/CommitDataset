Update CertificateRequestCallback usage to match new tcnative

Motiviation:

Previously the way how CertificateRequestCallback was working had some issues which could cause memory leaks and segfaults. Due of this tcnative code was updated to change the signature of the method provided by the interface.

Modifications:

Update CertificateRequestCallback implementations to match new interface signature.

Result:

No more segfaults / memory leaks when using boringssl or openssl >= 1.1.0
