Correctly skip OpenSsl* tests if OpenSsl.isAvailable() is false.

Motivation:

We missed to skip some tests for OpenSsl when OpenSsl.isAvailable() is false.

Modifications:

- Correctly skip tests when OpenSsl.isAvailable() is false.
- Simplify some code by using @BeforeClass.

Result:

Be able to compile netty even when OpenSsl is not present on the system.
