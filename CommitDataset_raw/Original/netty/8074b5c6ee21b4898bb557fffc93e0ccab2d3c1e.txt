[#2542] HTTP post request decoder does not support quoted boundaries

Motivation:
According to RFC2616 section 19, boundary string could be quoted, but
currently the PostRequestDecoder does not support it while it should.

Modifications:
Once the boundary is found, one check is made to verify if the boundary
is "quoted", and if so, it is "unqoted".

Note: in following usage of this boundary (as delimiter), quote seems no
more allowed according to the same RFC, so the reason that only the
boundary definition is corrected.

Result:
Now the boundary could be whatever quoted or not. A Junit test case
checks it.
