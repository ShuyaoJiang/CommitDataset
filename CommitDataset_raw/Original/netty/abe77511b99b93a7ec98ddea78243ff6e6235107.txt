Remove dead code in Http2CodecUtil (#8009)

Motivation:

The `ByteBuffer emptyPingBuf()` method of Http2CodecUtils is has been dead
code since DefaultHttp2PingFrame switched from using a ByteBuf to represent
the 8 octets to a long.

Modifications:

Remove the method and the unused static ByteBuf.

Result:

Less dead code.

Fixes #8002
