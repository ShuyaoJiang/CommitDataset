Only try to deregister from EventLoop when the native Channel was registered before.

Motivation:

We only can call eventLoop() if we are registered on an EventLoop yet. As we just did this without checking we spammed the log with an error that was harmless.

Modifications:

Check if registered on eventLoop before try to deregister on close.

Result:

Fixes [#6770]
