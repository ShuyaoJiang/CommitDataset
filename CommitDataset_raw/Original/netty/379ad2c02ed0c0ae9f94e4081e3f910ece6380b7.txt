Support preloading of tcnative share lib

Motivation:

Some applications may use alternative methods of loading the tcnative JNI symbols. We should support this use case.

Modifications:

Separate the loading and initialzation of the tcnative library so that each can fail independently.

Result:

Fixes #5043
