Correctly implement SelectedSelectionKeySet.Iterator remove()

Motivation:

We need to implement remove() by ourselves to make it work on Java7 as otherwise it will throw an AbstractMethodError. This is a followup of c1a335446daf5892eab2e134538ba0388162f18b.

Modifications:

Just implemented remove()

Result:

Works on Java7 as well.
