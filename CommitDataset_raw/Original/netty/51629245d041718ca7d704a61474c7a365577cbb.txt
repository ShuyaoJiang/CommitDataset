Call debugData.retain() before we forward the frame to the pipeline

Motivation:

We need to call debugData.retain() before we forward the frame to the pipeline as ByteToMessageDecoder will call release() on the buffer.

Modifications:

Correctly retain debugData and fix the unit test to test for it.

Result:

No more IllegalReferenceCountException when using the Http2FrameCodec.
