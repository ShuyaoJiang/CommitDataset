Cleanup HTTP/2 tests for Http2FrameCodec and Http2MultiplexCodec (#8646)

Motiviation:

Http2FrameCodecTest and Http2MultiplexCodecTest were quite fragile and often not went through the whole pipeline which made testing sometimes hard and error-prone.

Modification:

- Refactor tests to have data flow through the whole pipeline and so made the test more robust (by testing the while implementation).

Result:

Easier to write tests for the codecs in the future and more robust testing in general.

Beside this it also fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/6036.
