Fix IllegalReferenceCountException when using Http2MultiplexCodec and a DefaultHttp2GoAwayFrame with a non empty ByteBuffer is received. (#7894)

Motivation:

We incorrectly called frame.release() in onHttp2GoAwayFrame which could lead to IllegalReferenceCountExceptions.  The call of release() is inappropriate because the fireChannelRead() in onHttp2Frame() will handle it.

Modifications:

- Not call frame.release()
- Add a unit test

Result:
