Revamp io.netty.handler.codec.socksx

While implementing netty-handler-proxy, I realized various issues in our
current socksx package. Here's the list of the modifications and their
background:

- Split message types into interfaces and default implementations
  - so that a user can implement an alternative message implementations
- Use classes instead of enums when a user might want to define a new
  constant
  - so that a user can extend SOCKS5 protocol, such as:
    - defining a new error code
    - defining a new address type
- Rename the message classes
  - to avoid abbreviated class names. e.g:
    - Cmd -> Command
    - Init -> Initial
  - so that the class names align better with the protocol
    specifications. e.g:
    - AuthRequest -> PasswordAuthRequest
    - AuthScheme -> AuthMethod
- Rename the property names of the messages
  - so that the property names align better when the field names in the
    protocol specifications
- Improve the decoder implementations
  - Give a user more control over when a decoder has to be removed
  - Use DecoderResult and DecoderResultProvider to handle decode failure
    gracefully. i.e. no more Unknown* message classes
- Add SocksPortUnifinicationServerHandler since it's useful to the users
  who write a SOCKS server
  - Cleaned up and moved from the socksproxy example
