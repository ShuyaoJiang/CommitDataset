DnsNameResolver.resolveAll(...) should not include duplicates (#9021)

Motivation:

DnsNameResolver#resolveAll(String) may return duplicate results in the event that the original hostname DNS response includes an IP address X and a CNAME that ends up resolving the same IP address X. This behavior is inconsistent with the JDKâ€™s resolver and is unexpected to retrun a List with duplicate entries from a resolveAll(..) call.

Modifications:

- Filter out duplicates
- Add unit test

Result:

More consistent and less suprising behavior
