HttpProxyHandler: allow setting headers

Motivation:

In some environments, the HTTP CONNECT handshake requires special headers to work.

Modification:

Update HttpProxyHandler to accept a HttpHeaders argument.

Result:

The header is passed along in the HTTP CONNECT request, and the proxy request can be successfully completed.
