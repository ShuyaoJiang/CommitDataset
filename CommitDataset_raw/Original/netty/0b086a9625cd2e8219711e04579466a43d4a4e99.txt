Do not log on explicit no unsafe

Motivation:

When Netty components are initialized, Netty attempts to determine if it
has access to unsafe. If Netty is not able to access unsafe (because of
security permissions, or because the JVM was started with an explicit
flag to tell Netty to not look for unsafe), Netty logs an info-level
message that looks like a warning:

Your platform does not provide complete low-level API for accessing
direct buffers reliably. Unless explicitly requested, heap buffer will
always be preferred to avoid potential system unstability.

This log message can appear in applications that depend on Netty for
networking, and this log message can be scary to end-users of such
platforms. This log message should not be emitted if the application was
started with an explicit flag telling Netty to not look for unsafe.

Modifications:

This commit refactors the unsafe detection logic to expose whether or
not the JVM was started with a flag telling Netty to not look for
unsafe. With this exposed information, the log message on unsafe being
unavailable can be modified to not be emitted when Netty is explicitly
told to not look for unsafe.

Result:

No log message is produced when unsafe is unavailable because Netty was
told to not look for it.
