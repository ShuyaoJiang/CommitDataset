Rename (Server)Bootstrap.(child)initializer to (child)handler

- The handler you specify with initializer() is actually simply added
  to the pipeline and that's all.  It's ChannelInitializer which does
  additional work.  For example, a user can specify just a single
  handler with initializer() and it will still work.  This is especially
  common for Bootstrap, so I renamed initializer to handler, which makes
  more sense.
