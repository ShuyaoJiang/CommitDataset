Allow writing with void promise if IdleStateHandler is configured in pipeline.

Motivation:

Allow writing with void promise if IdleStateHandler is configured in the pipeline for read timeout events.

Modifications:

Better performance.

Result:

No more ChannelFutureListeners are created if IdleStateHandler is only configured for read timeouts allowing for writing to the channel with void promise.
