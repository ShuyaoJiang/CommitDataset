Disable test as it sometimes fails on the CI

Motivation:

Temporary disable test that wwas introduced as part of f60d08fd32b7287f65077f99a88bac645834098f as it sometimes fail on the CI. We need to figure out why it fails there (can not reproduce so far even on the CI after ssh into it).

Modifications:

Ignore test.

Result:

More stable builds until we figure out the flackyness.
