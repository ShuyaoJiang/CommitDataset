Move methods for decode hex dump into StringUtil

Motivation:

PR #6811 introduced a public utility methods to decode hex dump and its parts, but they are not visible from netty-common.

Modifications:

1. Move the `decodeHexByte`, `decodeHexDump` and `decodeHexNibble` methods into `StringUtils`.
2. Apply these methods where applicable.
3. Remove similar methods from other locations (e.g. `HpackHex` test class).

Result:

Less code duplication.
