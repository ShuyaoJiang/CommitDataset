Do not fail a DNS query promise prematurely

Motivation:

DnsNameResolverContext completes its DNS query promise automatically
when no queries are in progress, which means there's no need to fail the
promise explicitly.

Modifications:

- Do not fail a DNS query promise explicitly but add an informational
  trace

Result:

- Fixes #6600
- Unexpected exception on one question type does not fail the promise
  too soon. If the other question succeeds, the query will succeed,
  making the resolver more robust.
