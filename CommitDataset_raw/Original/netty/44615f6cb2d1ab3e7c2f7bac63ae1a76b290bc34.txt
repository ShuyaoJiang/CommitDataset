Optimizations for Http2FrameLogger

Motivation:

The logger was always performing a hex dump of the ByteBufs regarless whether or not the log would take place.

Modifications:

Fixed the logger to avoid serializing the ByteBufs and calling the varargs method if logging is not enabled.

Result:

The loggers should run MUCH faster when disabled.
