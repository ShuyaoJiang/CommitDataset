Added SlicedAbstractByteBuf that can provide fast-path for _get* and _set* methods

Motivation:

SlicedByteBuf can be used for any ByteBuf implementations and so can not do any optimizations that could be done
when AbstractByteBuf is sliced.

Modifications:

- Add SlicedAbstractByteBuf that can eliminate range and reference count checks for _get* and _set* methods.

Result:

Faster SlicedByteBuf implementations for AbstractByteBuf sub-classes.
