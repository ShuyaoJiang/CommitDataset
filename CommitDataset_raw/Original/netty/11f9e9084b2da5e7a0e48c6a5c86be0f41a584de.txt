[#3921] EmbeddedChannel should add ChannelHandlers once registered

Motivation:

Currently in EmbeddedChannel we add the ChannelHandlers before the Channel is registered which leads to have the handlerAdded(...) callback
be called from outside the EventLoop and also prevent the user to obtain a reference to the EventLoop in the callback itself.

Modifications:

Delay adding ChannelHandlers until EmbeddedChannel is registered.

Result:

Correctly call handlerAdded(...) after EmbeddedChannel is registered.
