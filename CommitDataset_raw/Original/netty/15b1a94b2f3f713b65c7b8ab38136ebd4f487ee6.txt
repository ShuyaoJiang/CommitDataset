Ensure native memory is released when OpenSslServercontext constructor throws exception

Motivation:

We need to ensure we do all checks inside of the try / catch block so we free native memory that was allocated in the constructor of the super class in a timely manner.
Modifications:

Move all checks inside of the try block.

Result:

Correctly release native memory (and not depend on the finalizer) when a check in the constructors fails
