Adjust tests to be able to build / test when using IBM J9 / OpenJ9 (#8900)

Motivation:

We should run a CI job using J9 to ensure netty also works when using different JVMs.

Modifications:

- Adjust PooledByteBufAllocatorTest to be able to complete faster when using a JVM which takes longer when joining Threads (this seems to be the case with J9).
- Skip UDT tests on J9 as UDT is not supported there.

Result:

Be able to run CI against J9.
