Implement the ByteBuf methods that should have been overridden

Motivation:

Some ByteBuf implementations do not override all necessary methods,
which can lead to potentially sub-optimal behavior.

Also, SlicedByteBuf does not perform the range check correctly due to
missing overrides.

Modifications:

- Add missing overrides
- Use unwrap() instead of direct member access in derived buffers for
  consistency
- Merge unwrap0() into unwrap() using covariant return type
- Deprecate AbstractDerivedByteBuf and its subtypes, because they were
  not meant to be public

Result:

Correctness
