Allow to get existing ChannelOption / AttributeKey from String

Motivation:

We should allow to get a ChannelOption/AttributeKey from a String. This will make it a lot easier to make use of configuration files in applications.

Modifications:

- Add exists(...), newInstance(...) method to ChannelOption and AttributeKey and alter valueOf(...) to return an existing instance for a String or create one.
- Add unit tests.

Result:

Much more flexible usage of ChannelOption and AttributeKey.
