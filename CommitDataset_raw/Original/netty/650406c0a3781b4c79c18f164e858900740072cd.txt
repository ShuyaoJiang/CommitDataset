Http2MultiplexCodec now propagates SETTINGS and GOAWAY frames in pipeline.

Motivation:

Allow the observation of SETTINGS frame by other handlers in the pipeline. For my particular use case this allows me to observe the value of MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS for a ChannelPool abstraction that supports HTTP/2 multiplexing. Beside this also forward GOAWAY frames.

Modification:

Always forward SETTINGS and GOAWAY frames

Result:

Settings / Goaway can now be observed in the parent channel. Previously it was not possible (to my knowledge) to capture the settings when using Http2MultiplexCodec.
