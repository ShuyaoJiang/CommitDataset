SocksCmdRequest and SocksCmdResponse are trying to convert host from IDN for the non-DOMAIN address types

Motivation:

In the SocksCmdRequest and SocksCmdResponse constructors a host param converts from IDN to ascii compatible form regardless address type.

Modifications:

Use `IDN#toASCII` only for `DOMAIN` address type.

Result:

More correct host handling in socks commands.
