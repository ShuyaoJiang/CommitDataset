Cleaning up HTTP/2 method names for max_concurrent_streams

Motivation:

The current documentation for Endpoint methods referring to concurrent streams and the SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS setting are a bit confusing.

Modifications:

Renamed a few of the methods and added more clear documentation.

Result:

Fixes #3451
