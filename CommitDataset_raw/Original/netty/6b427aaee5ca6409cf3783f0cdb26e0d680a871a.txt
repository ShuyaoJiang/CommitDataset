Improve client SNI in testSniWithApnHandler

Motivations
The test SniHandlerTest#testSniWithApnHandler() does not actually
involve SNI: given the client setup, the ClientHello in the form of hex
strings is not actually written to the wire, so the server never receives that.
We may need to write in somewhere else (e.g., channelActive()) instead of in
initChannel() in order for the hex strings to reach the server. So here
what's actually going on is an ordinary TLS C/S communication without SNI.

Modifications
The client part is modified to enable SNI by using an SslHandler with an
SSLEngine created by io.netty.handler.ssl.SslContext#newEngine(), where
the server hostname is specified. Also, more clauses are added to verify that
the SNI is indeed successful.

Results
Now the test verifies that both SNI and APN actually happen and succeed.
