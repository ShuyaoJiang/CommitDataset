Adding client auth to SslContextBuilder

Motivation:

To simplify the use of client auth, we need to add it to the SslContextBuilder.

Modifications:

Added a ClientAuth enum and plumbed it through the builder, down into the contexts/engines.

Result:

Client auth can be configured when building an SslContext.
