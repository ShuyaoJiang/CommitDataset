Correct filling an `origin` header for WS client

Motivation:
An `origin`/`sec-websocket-origin` header value in websocket client is filling incorrect in some cases:
- Hostname is not converting to lower-case as prescribed by RFC 6354 (see [1]).
- Selecting a `http` scheme when source URI has `wss`/`https` scheme and non-standard port.

Modifications:
- Convert uri-host to lower-case.
- Use a `https` scheme if source URI scheme is `wss`/`https`, or if source scheme is null and port == 443.

Result:
Correct filling an `origin` header for WS client.
