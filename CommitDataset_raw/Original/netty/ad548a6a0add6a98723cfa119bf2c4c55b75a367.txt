Fixing CorsHandler response Content-Length

Motivation:

https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/7253

Modifications:

Adding `Content-Length: 0` to `CorsHandler.forbidden()` and `CorsHandler.handlePreflight()`

Result:

Contexts that are terminated by the CorsHandler will always include a Content-Length header
