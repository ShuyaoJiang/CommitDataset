Remove or de-prioritize RC4 from default cipher suites

Motivation:

RC4 is not a recommended cipher suite anymore, as the recent research
reveals, such as:

- http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/

Modifications:

- Remove most RC4 cipher suites from the default cipher suites
- For backward compatibility, leave RC4-SHA, while de-prioritizing it

Result:

Potentially safer default
