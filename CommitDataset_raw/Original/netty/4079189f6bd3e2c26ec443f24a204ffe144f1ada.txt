Allow to offload / customize key signing operations when using BoringSSL. (#8943)

Motivation:

BoringSSL allows to customize the way how key signing is done an even offload it from the IO thread. We should provide a way to plugin an own implementation when BoringSSL is used.

Modifications:

- Introduce OpenSslPrivateKeyMethod that can be used by the user to implement custom signing by using ReferenceCountedOpenSslContext.setPrivateKeyMethod(...)
- Introduce static methods to OpenSslKeyManagerFactory which allows to create a KeyManagerFactory which supports to do keyless operations by let the use handle everything in OpenSslPrivateKeyMethod.
- Add testcase which verifies that everything works as expected

Result:

A user is able to customize the way how keys are signed.
