CompositeByteBuf.addComponent always assume reference count ownership

Motivation:
The current interface for CompositeByteBuf.addComponent is not clear under what conditions ownership is transferred when addComponent is called. There should be a well defined behavior so that users can ensure that no leaks occur.

Modifications:
- CompositeByteBuf.addComponent should always assume reference count ownership

Result:
Users that call CompositeByteBuf.addComponent do not have to independently check if the buffer's ownership has been transferred and if not independently release the buffer.
