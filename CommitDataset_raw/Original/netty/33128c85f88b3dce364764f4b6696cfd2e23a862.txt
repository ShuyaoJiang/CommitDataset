Add SSLEngineTest to ensure Signature Algorithms are present during KeyManager calls. (#8965)

Motivation:

We had a bug which could case ExtendedSSLSession.getPeerSupportedSignatureAlgorithms() return an empty array when using BoringSSL. This testcase verifies we correctly return algorithms after the fix in https://github.com/netty/netty-tcnative/pull/449.

Modifications:

Add testcase to verify behaviour.

Result:

Ensure we correctly retuen the algorithms.
