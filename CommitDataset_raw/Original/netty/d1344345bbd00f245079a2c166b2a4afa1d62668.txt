DnsResolver.resolve(...) fails when ipaddress is used.

Motivation:

DnsResolver.resolve(...) fails when an InetSocketAddress is used that was constructed of an ipaddress string.

Modifications:

Don't try to lookup when the InetSocketAddress was constructed via an ipaddress.

Result:

DnsResolver.resolve(...) works in all cases.
