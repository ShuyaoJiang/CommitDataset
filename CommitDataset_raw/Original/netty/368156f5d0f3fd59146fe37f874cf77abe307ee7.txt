Another round of the new API design

- Channel now creates a ChannelPipeline by itself

  I find no reason to allow a user to use one's own pipeline
  implementation since I saw nobody does except for the cases where a
  user wants to add a user attribute to a channel, which is now covered
  by AttributeMap.

- Removed ChannelEvent and its subtypes because they are replaced by
  direct method invocation.
- Replaced ChannelSink with Channel.unsafe()
- Various getter renaming (e.g. Channel.getId() -> Channel.id())
- Added ChannelHandlerInvoker interface
- Implemented AbstractChannel and AbstractServerChannel
- Some other changes I don't remember
