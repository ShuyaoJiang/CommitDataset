Respect -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack when using epoll transport

Motivation:

On a system where ipv4 and ipv6 are supported a user may want to use -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true to restrict it to use ipv4 only.
This is currently ignored with the epoll transport.

Modifications:

Respect java.net.preferIPv4Stack system property.

Result:

-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true will have the effect the user is looking for.
