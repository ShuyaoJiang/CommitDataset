Adapt Http2ServerDowngrader to work with clients

Motivation:
Http2ServerDowngrader is specifically built for server channels where
inbound Http2StreamFrames are converted into HttpRequests, and outbound
HttpResponses are converted into Http2StreamFrames. It can be easily
made to be more generic to work with client channels where inbound
Http2StreamFrames are converted into HttpResponses, and outbound
HttpRequests are converted into Http2StreamFrames.

Modification:
- Renamed Http2ServerDowngrader to a more general
  Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec
- Made it take in an "isServer" parameter to determine whether encoding
  inbound Http2StreamFrames should create HttpRequests (for server) or
  HttpResponses (for client)
- Norman fixed a leak in the unit test. Thanks! :-)

Result:
Now Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec can be used to translate
Http2StreamFrame to HttpObject for both server and client.
