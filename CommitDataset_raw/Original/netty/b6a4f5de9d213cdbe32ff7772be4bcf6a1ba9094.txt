Refactor of HttpUtil and HttpHeaderUtil

Motivation:
There currently exists http.HttpUtil, http2.HttpUtil, and http.HttpHeaderUtil. Having 2 HttpUtil methods can be confusing and the utilty methods in the http package could be consolidated.

Modifications:
- Rename http2.HttpUtil to http2.HttpConversionUtil
- Move http.HttpHeaderUtil methods into http.HttpUtil

Result:
Consolidated utilities whose names don't overlap.
