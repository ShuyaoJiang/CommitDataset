Refactor the pipeline API to support stacked codecs

- Previous API did not support the pipeline which contains multiple
  MessageToStreamEncoders because there was no way to find the closest
  outbound byte buffer.  Now you always get the correct buffer even if
  the handler that provides the buffer is placed distantly.
  For example:
  
    Channel -> MsgAEncoder -> MsgBEncoder -> MsgCEncoder
  
  Msg(A|B|C)Encoder will all have access to the channel's outbound
  byte buffer.  Previously, it was simply impossible.

- Improved ChannelBufferHolder.toString()
