[#4755] Make WebSocketClientCompressionHandler @Sharable

Motivation:

WebSocketClientCompressionHandler is stateless so it should be @Sharable.

Modifications:

Add @Sharable annotation to WebSocketClientCompressionHandler, make constructor private and add static field to get the instance.

Result:

Less object creation.
