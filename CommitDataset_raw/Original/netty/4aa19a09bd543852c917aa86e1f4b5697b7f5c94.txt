Implement SSLSession.invalidate() and isValid() for OpenSSLEngine.

Motivation:

The SSLSession allows to invalidate a SSLSession and so disallow resume of a session. We should support this for OpenSSLEngine as well.

Modifications:

- Correctly implement SSLSession.isValid() and invalidate() in OpenSSLEngine
- Add unit test.

Result:

Invalidate of SSL sessions is supported when using OpenSSL now.
