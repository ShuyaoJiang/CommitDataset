Add FixedCompositeByteBuf which can be used to write an array of ByteBuf in an efficient way.

This implementation does not produce as much GC pressure as CompositeByteBuf and so is prefered,
for writing an array of ByteBufs. Be aware that FixedCompositeByteBuf is readonly.

When using this in a project that make heavy use of CompositeByteBuf for writes we was able to cut
down allocation to a half.
