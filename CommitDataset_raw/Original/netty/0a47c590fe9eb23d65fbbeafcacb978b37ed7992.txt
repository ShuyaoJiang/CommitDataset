HttpHeaders valuesIterator and contains improvements

Motivation:
In order to determine if a header contains a value we currently rely
upon getAll(..) and regular expressions. This operation is commonly used
during the encode and decode stage to determine the transfer encoding
(e.g. HttpUtil#isTransferEncodingChunked). This operation requires an
intermediate collection and possibly regular expressions for the
CombinedHttpHeaders use case which can be expensive.

Modifications:
- Add a valuesIterator to HttpHeaders and specializations of this method
for DefaultHttpHeaders, ReadOnlyHttpHeaders, and CombinedHttpHeaders.

Result:
Less intermediate collections and allocation overhead when determining
if HttpHeaders contains a name/value pair.
