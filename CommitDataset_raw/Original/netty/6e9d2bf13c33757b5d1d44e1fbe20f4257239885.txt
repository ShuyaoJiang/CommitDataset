Correctly set the alert type depending of the CertificateException

Motivation:

Depending on the actual CertificateException we should set the correct alert type so it will be sent back to the remote peer and so make it easier for them to fix it.

Modification:

Correctly set the alert and not always just use a general alert.

Result:

It's easier for the remote peer to fix the problems.
