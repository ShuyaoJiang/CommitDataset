Use a single queue in UniformStreamByteDistributor

Motivation:

The UniformStreamByteDistributor currently processes all zero-length frames, regardless of add order. This means that we would always send HEADERS for all streams, possibly taking away bandwidth for streams that actually have data.

Modifications:

Empty frames are now treated the same as any other frame except that the algorithm will pop off the any empty frames at the head of the queue.

Result:

Empty frames require no extra processing.
