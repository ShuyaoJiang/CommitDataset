Ensure we not sent duplicate certificates when using OpenSslEngine

Motivation:

We need to ensure we not set duplicated certificates when using OpenSslEngine.

Modifications:

- Skip first cert in chain when set the chain itself and so not send duplicated certificates
- Add interopt unit tests to ensure no duplicates are send.

Result:

No more duplicates.
