[#3806] Setting WRITE_BUFFER_LOW_WATER_MARK before WRITE_BUFFER_HIGH_WATER_MARK results in an internal Exception

Motivation:

Setting the WRITE_BUFFER_LOW_WATER_MARK before WRITE_BUFFER_HIGH_WATER_MARK results in an internal Exception (appears only in the logs) if the value is larger than the default high water mark value. The WRITE_BUFFER_HIGH_WATER_MARK call appears to have no effect in this context.

Setting the values in the reverse order works.

Modifications:

- deprecated ChannelOption.WRITE_BUFFER_HIGH_WATER_MARK and
ChannelOption.WRITE_BUFFER_LOW_WATER_MARK.
- add one new option called ChannelOption.WRITE_BUFFER_WATER_MARK.

Result:
The high/low water mark values limits caused by default values are removed.
