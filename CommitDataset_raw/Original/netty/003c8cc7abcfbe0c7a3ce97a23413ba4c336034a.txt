Expose all defaults on PooledByteBufAllocator

Motivation:
Most, but not all defaults are statically exposed on
PooledByteBufAllocator.  This makes it cumbersome to make a custom
allocator where most of the defaults remain the same.

Modification:
Expose useCacheForAllThreads, and Direct preferred.  The latter is
needed because it is under the internal package, and public code
should probably not depend on it.

Result:
More customizeable allocators
