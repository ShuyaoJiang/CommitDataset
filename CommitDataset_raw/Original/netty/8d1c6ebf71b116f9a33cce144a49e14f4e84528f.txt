Only do priming read if there is no space in dsts buffers.

Motivation:

A SSL_read is needed to ensure the bio buffer is flushed, for this we did a priming read. This can be removed in many cases. Also ensure we always fill as much as possible in the destination buffers.

Modifications:

- Only do priming read if capacity of all dsts buffers is zero
- Always produce as must data as possible in the dsts buffers.

Result:

Faster code.
