PlatformDependent String char[] optimization

Motivation:
PlatformDependent0 has an optimization which grabs the char[] from a String. Since this code was introduced http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/254 has been gaining momentum in JDK 9. This JEP changes the internal storage from char[] to byte[], and thus the existing char[] only based optimizations will not work.

Modifications:
- The ASCII encoding char[] String optimizations should also work for byte[].

Result:
ASCII encoding char[] String optimizations don't break if the underlying storage in String is byte[].
