SocketStringEchoTest improvements

Motivation:
SocketStringEchoTest has been observed to fail and it has numerous issues which when resolved may help reduce the test failures.

Modifications:
- A volatile counter and a spin/sleep loop is used to trigger test termination. Incrementing a volatile is generally bad practice and can be avoided in this situation. This mechanism can be replaced by a promise. This mechanism should also trigger upon exception or channel inactive.
- Asserts are done in the Netty threads. Although these should result in a exceptionCaught the test may not observe these failures because it is spinning waiting for the count to reach the desired value.

Result:
Cleaner test.
