Proper shutdown of HTTP2 encoder when channelInactive

Motivation:

The problem is described in https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/605. Basically, when using `StreamBufferingEncoder` there is a chance of creating zombie streams that never get closed.

Modifications:

Change `Http2ConnectionHandler`'s `channelInactive` handling logic to shutdown the encoder/decoder before shutting down the active streams.

Result:

Fixes https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/605
