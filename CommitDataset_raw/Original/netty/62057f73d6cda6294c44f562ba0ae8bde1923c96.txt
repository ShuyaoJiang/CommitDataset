Fix handling of non-auto read for ByteToMessageDecoder and SslHandler

Motivation:

Our automatically handling of non-auto-read failed because it not detected the need of calling read again by itself if nothing was decoded. Beside this handling of non-auto-read never worked for SslHandler as it always triggered a read even if it decoded a message and auto-read was false.

This fixes [#3529] and [#3587].

Modifications:

- Implement handling of calling read when nothing was decoded (with non-auto-read) to ByteToMessageDecoder again
- Correctly respect non-auto-read by SslHandler

Result:

No more stales and correctly respecting of non-auto-read by SslHandler.
