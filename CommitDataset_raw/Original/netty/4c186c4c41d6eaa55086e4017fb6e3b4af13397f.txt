Make netty-transport-native-epoll-*-linux-x86_64.jar working in OSGi

Motivation:

Currenlty, netty-transport-native-epoll-*-linux-x86_64.jar is not packed as OSGi bundle
and thus not working in OSGi environment.

Modifications:

In netty-transport-native-epoll's pom.xml added configuration
to attach manifest to the jar with a native library.
In netty-common's pom.xml added configuration instruction (DynamicImport-Package)
to maven bnd plugin to make sure the native code is loaded from
netty-transport-native-epoll bundle.

Result:

The netty-transport-native-epoll-*-linux-x86_64.jar is a bundle (MANIFEST.MF attached)
and the inluced native library can be successfuly loaded in OSGi environment.
Fixing #5119
