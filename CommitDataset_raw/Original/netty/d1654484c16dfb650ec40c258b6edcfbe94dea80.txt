Correctly convert between openssl / boringssl and java cipher names when using TLSv1.3 (#8485)

Motivation:

We did not correctly convert between openssl / boringssl and java ciphers when using TLV1.3 which had different effects when either using openssl or boringssl.
 - When using openssl and TLSv1.3 we always returned SSL_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL as cipher name
 - When using boringssl with TLSv1.3 we always returned an incorrect constructed cipher name which does not match what is defined by Java.

Modifications:

 - Add correct mappings in CipherSuiteConverter for both openssl and boringssl
 - Add unit tests for CipherSuiteConvert
 - Add unit in SSLEngine which checks that we do not return SSL_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL ever and that server and client returns the same cipher name.

Result:

Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/8477.
