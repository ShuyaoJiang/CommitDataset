Fix the life cycle mapping problem with m2e

Motivation:

It should be frictionless to import our project into Eclipse

Modifications:

Exclude the plugins with missing life cycle mapping. They are not useful
for use with IDE anyway.

Result:

Fixes #2488
Netty is imported into Eclipse without a problem.
