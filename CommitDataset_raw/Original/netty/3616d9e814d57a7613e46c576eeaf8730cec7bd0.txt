Correctly handle wildcard address when bind to socket and using native transport

Motivation:

When a wildcard address is used to bind a socket and ipv4 and ipv6 are usable we should accept both (just like JDK IO/NIO does).

Modifications:

Detect wildcard address and if so use in6addr_any

Result:

Correctly accept ipv4 and ipv6
