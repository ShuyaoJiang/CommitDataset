Add a test case to check sub strings' AsciiString hash code

Motivation:

AsciiString.hashCode(o) , if "o" is a subString, the hash code is not always same, when netty’s version is 4.1.1.Final and jdk’s version is 1.6.

Modifications:

Use a test to assert hash codes are equal between a new string and any sub string (a part of  a char array),If their values are equal.

Result:

Create a test method to AsciiStringCharacterTest.
