AsciiString optimized hashCode

Motivation:
The AsciiString.hashCode() method can be optimized. This method is frequently used while to build the DefaultHeaders data structure.

Modification:
- Add a PlatformDependent hashCode algorithm which utilizes UNSAFE if available

Result:
AsciiString hashCode is faster.
