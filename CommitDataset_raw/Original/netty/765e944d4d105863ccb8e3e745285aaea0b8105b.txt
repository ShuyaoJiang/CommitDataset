HTTP/2 limit streams in all states

Motivation:
SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS does not apply to idle streams and thus we do not apply any explicit limitations on how many idle streams can be created. This may allow a peer to consume an undesirable amount of resources.

Modifications:
- Each Endpoint should enforce a limit for streams in a any state. By default this limit will be the same as SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS but can be overridden if necessary.

Result:
There is now a limit to how many IDLE streams can be created.
