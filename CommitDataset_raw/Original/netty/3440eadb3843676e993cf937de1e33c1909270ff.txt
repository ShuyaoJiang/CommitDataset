Http2ConnectionHandler should propagate channelActive and channelInactive events.

Motivation:

The Http2ConnectionHandler incorrectly doesn't propagate channelActive and channelInactive events and thus breaks the pipeline
for other ChannelHandler.

Modification:

- Add calls to super.channelActive() and super.channelInactive().
- Remove unused methods.

Result:

- Http2ConnectionHandler can be used with other ChannelHandlers.
