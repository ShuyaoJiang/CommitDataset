Return the new buffer's capacity is same with the requested capacity

- Rename capacity variables to reqCapacity or normCapacity to distinguish if its the request capacity or the normalized capacity
- Do not reallocate on ByteBuf.capacity(int) if reallocation is unnecessary; just update the index range.
- Revert the workaround in DefaultChannelHandlerContext
