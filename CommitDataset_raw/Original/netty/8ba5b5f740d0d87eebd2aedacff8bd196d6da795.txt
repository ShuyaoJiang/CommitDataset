Update Default Cipher List

Motivation:
Our default cipher list has not been updated in a while. We current support some older ciphers not commonly in use and we don't support some newer ciphers which are more commonly used.

Modifications:
- Update the default list of ciphers for JDK and OpenSSL.

Result:
Default cipher list is more likely to connect to peers.
