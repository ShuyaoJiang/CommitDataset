Support compiling netty with Java9

Motivation:

Java9 will be released soon so we should ensure we can compile netty with Java9 and run all our tests. This will help to make sure Netty will be usable with Java9.

Modification:

- Add some workarounds to be able to compile with Java9, note that the full profile is not supported with Java9 atm.
- Remove some usage of internal APIs to be able to compile on java9
- Not support Alpn / Npn and so not run the tests when using Java9 for now. We will do a follow up PR to add support.

Result:

Its possible to build netty and run its testsuite with Java9.
