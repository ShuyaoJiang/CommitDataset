[#5882] Ensure we even process tasks if processing of ready channels throws an Exception in event loop.

Motivation:

If an exception is thrown while processing the ready channels in the EventLoop we should still run all tasks as this may allow to recover. For example a OutOfMemoryError may be thrown and runAllTasks() will free up memory again. Beside this we should also ensure we always allow to shutdown even if an exception was thrown.

Modifications:

- Call runAllTasks() in a finally block
- Ensure shutdown is always handles.

Result:

More robust EventLoop implementations for NIO and Epoll.
