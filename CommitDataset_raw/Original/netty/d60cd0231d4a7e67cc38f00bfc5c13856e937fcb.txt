HttpProxyHandler generates invalid CONNECT url and Host header when address is resolved

Motivation:

HttpProxyHandler uses `NetUtil#toSocketAddressString` to compute
CONNECT url and Host header.

The url is correct when the address is unresolved, as
`NetUtil#toSocketAddressString` will then use
`getHoststring`/`getHostname`. If the address is already resolved, the
url will be based on the IP instead of the hostname.

Thereâ€™s an additional minor issue with the Host header: default port
443 should be omitted.

Modifications:

* Introduce NetUtil#getHostname
* Introduce HttpUtil#formatHostnameForHttp to format an
InetSocketAddress to
HTTP format
* Change url computation to favor hostname instead of IP
* Introduce HttpProxyHandler ignoreDefaultPortsInConnectHostHeader
parameter to ignore 80 and 443 ports in Host header

Result:

HttpProxyHandler performs properly when connecting to a resolved address
