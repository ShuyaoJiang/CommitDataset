Don't try to use UnixResolverDnsServerAddressStreamProvider when on Windows.

Motivation:

We should not try to use UnixResolverDnsServerAddressStreamProvider when on Windows as it will log some error that will produce noise and may confuse users.

Modifications:

Just use DefaultDnsServerAddressStreamProvider if windows is used.

Result:

Less noise in the logs. This was reported in vert.x: https://github.com/eclipse/vert.x/issues/2204
