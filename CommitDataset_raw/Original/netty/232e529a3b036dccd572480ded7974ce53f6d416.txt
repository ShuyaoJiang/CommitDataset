Fix missing version properties of transport-epoll in all-in-one JAR

Related: #2952

Motivation:

META-INF/io.netty.versions.properties in netty-all-*.jar does not
contain the version information about the netty-transport-epoll module.

Modifications:

Fix a bug in the regular expression in pom.xml, so that the artifacts
with a classifier is also included in the version properties file.

Result:

The version information of all modules are included in the version
properties file, and Version.identify() does not miss
netty-transport-epoll.
