[#2308] Use SelectorProvider.open*() to open NIO channels and so remove condition when create new NIO channels.

Motivation:
At the moment we use SocketChannel.open(), ServerSocketChannel.open() and DatagramSocketChannel.open(...) within the constructor of our
NIO channels. This introduces a bottleneck if you create a lot of connections as these calls delegate to SelectorProvider.provider() which
uses synchronized internal. This change removed the bottleneck.

Modifications:
Obtain a static instance of the SelectorProvider and use SelectorProvider.openSocketChannel(), SelectorProvider.openServerSocketChannel() and
SelectorProvider.openDatagramChannel(). This eliminates the bottleneck as SelectorProvider.provider() is not called on every channel creation.

Result:
Less conditions when create new channels.
