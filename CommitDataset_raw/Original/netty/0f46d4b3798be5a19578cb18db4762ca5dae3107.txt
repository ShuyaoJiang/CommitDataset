Revert 25c7a783a788b04f148c56f12d6efe1e11d093cd and fix #1064 differently

- Rename inbound/outboundBufferFreed to inbound/OutboundShutdown which makes more sense
- Move DefaultChannelHandlerContext.isInbound/OutboundBufferFreed() to DefaultChannelPipeline
- Fix a problem where invokeFreeInbound/OutboundBuffer() sets inbound/outboundShutdown too early (this was the direct cause of #1064)
- Remove the volatile modifier - DCHC.prev/next are volatile and that's just enough
