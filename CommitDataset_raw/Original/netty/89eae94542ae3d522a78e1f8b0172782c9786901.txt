Allow to extend IdleStateHandler and so provide more details for IdleStateEvents

Motivation:

Sometimes it is useful to include more details in the IdleStateEvents that are produced by the IdleStateHandler. For this users should be able to create their own IdleStateEvents that encapsulate more informations.

Modifications:

- Make IdleStateEvent constructor protected and the class non-final
- Add protected method to IdleStateHandler that users can override and so create their own IdleStateEvents.

Result:

More flexible and customizable IdleStateEvents / IdleStateHandler
