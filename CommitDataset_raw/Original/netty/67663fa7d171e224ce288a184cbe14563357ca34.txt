HttpContentDecoder must continue read when it did not produce any mesâ€¦ (#8922)

Motivation:

When HttpContentDecoder (and so HttpContentDecompressor) does not produce any message we need to make sure it calls ctx.read() if auto read is false to not stale.

Modifications:

- Keep track if we need to call ctx.read() or not
- Add unit test

Result:

Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/8915.
