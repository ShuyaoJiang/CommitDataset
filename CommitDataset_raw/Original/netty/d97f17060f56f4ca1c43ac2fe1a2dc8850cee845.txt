Support non chunked HTTP request bodies larger than Integer.MAX_VALUE.

Motivation:

Request bodies can easily be larger than Integer.MAX_VALUE in practice.
There's no reason, or intention, for Netty to impose this artificial constraint.

Worse, it currently does not fail if the body is larger than this value;
it just silently only reads the first Integer.MAX_VALUE bytes and discards the rest.

This restriction doesn't effect chunked transfers, with no Content-Length header.

Modifications:

Force the use of `long HttpUtil.getContentLength(HttpMessage, long)` instead of
`long HttpUtil.getContentLength(HttpMessage, long)`.

Result:

Netty will support HTTP request bodies of up to Long.MAX_VALUE length.
