Adding method to assert XML decoder framing works

Motivation:

In an effort to better understand how the XmlFrameDecoder works, I consulted the tests to find a method that would reframe the inputs as per the Javadocs for that class. I couldn't find any methods that seemed to be doing it, so I wanted to add one to reinforce my understanding.

Modification:

Add a new test method to XmlFrameDecoder to assert that the reframing works as described.

Result:

New test method is added to XmlFrameDecoder
