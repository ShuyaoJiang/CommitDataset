Fix false-positive leak detection report when ReferenceCountedOpenSslEngine constructor throws.

Motivation:

We need to ensure we only create the ResourceLeak when the constructor not throws.

Modifications:

Ensure ResourceLeakDetector.track(...) is only called if the constructor of ReferenceCoundedOpenSslEngine not throws.

Result:

No more false-positves.
