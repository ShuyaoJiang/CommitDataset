Make DelegatingChannelPromiseNotifier use Vararg overload

Motivation:
ErrorProne complains that the array override doesn't match the
vararg super call.  See http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/Overrides

Additionally, almost every other Future uses the vararg form, so
it would be stylistically consistent to keep it that way.

Modifications:
Use vararg override.

Result:
Cleaner, less naggy code.
