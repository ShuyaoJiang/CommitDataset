Overhaul - Split ChannelHandler & Merge ChannelHandlerContext

- Extracted some handler methods from ChannelInboundHandler into
  ChannelStateHandler
- Extracted some handler methods from ChannelOutboundHandler into
  ChannelOperationHandler
- Moved exceptionCaught and userEventTriggered are now in
  ChannelHandler
  
- Channel(Inbound|Outbound)HandlerContext is merged into
  ChannelHandlerContext
- ChannelHandlerContext adds direct access methods for inboud and
  outbound buffers
  - The use of ChannelBufferHolder is minimal now.
    - Before: inbound().byteBuffer()
    - After: inboundByteBuffer()
    - Simpler and better performance
    
- Bypass buffer types were removed because it just does not work at all
  with the thread model.
  - All handlers that uses a bypass buffer are broken.  Will fix soon.

- CombinedHandlerAdapter does not make sense anymore either because
  there are four handler interfaces to consider and often the two
  handlers will implement the same handler interface such as
  ChannelStateHandler.  Thinking of better ways to provide this feature
