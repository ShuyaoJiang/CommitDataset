Only try to call SSL.setHostnameValidation(...) if needed. (#8074)

Motivation:

As the used OpenSSL version may not support hostname validation we should only really call SSL.setHostNameValidation(...) if we detect that its needed.

Modifications:

Only call SSL.setHostNameValidation if it was disabled before and now it needs to be enabled or if it was enabled before and it should be disabled now.

Result:

Less risk of an exception when using an OpenSSL version that does not support hostname validation.
