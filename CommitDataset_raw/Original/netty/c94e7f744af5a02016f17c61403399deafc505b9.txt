DefaultChannelPipeline needs to release objects

Motiviation:
If user events or excpetions reach the tail end of the pipeline they are not released. This could result in buffer leaks.

Motivation:
- Use the ReferenceCountUtil.release to release objects for the userEventTriggered and exceptionCaught methods on DefaultChannelPipeline

Result:
2 less areas where buffer leaks can occur.
