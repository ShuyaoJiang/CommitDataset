SSLHandler may throw AssertionError if writes occur before channelActâ€¦ (#8486)

Motivation:

If you attempt to write to a channel with an SslHandler prior to channelActive being called you can hit an assertion. In particular - if you write to a channel it forces some handshaking (through flush calls) to occur.

The AssertionError only happens on Java11+.

Modifications:

- Replace assert by an "early return" in case of the handshake be done already.
- Add unit test that verifies we do not hit the AssertionError anymore and that the future is correctly failed.

Result:

Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/8479.
