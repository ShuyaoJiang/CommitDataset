Reorder PlatformDependent.isRoot() check

Motivation:

isRoot() is an expensive operation. We should avoid calling it if
possible.

Modifications:

Move the isRoot() checks to the end of the 'if' block, so that isRoot()
is evaluated only when really necessary.

Result:

isRoot() is evaluated only when SO_BROADCAST is set and the bind address
is anylocal address.
