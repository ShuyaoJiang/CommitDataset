HTTP/2 UniformStreamByteDistributor negative window shouldn't write

Motivation:
If the stream window is negative UniformStreamByteDistributor may write data. This is prohibited by the RFC https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-6.9.2.

Modifications:
- UniformStreamByteDistributor should use StreamState.isWriteAllowed()

Result:
UniformStreamByteDistributor is more complaint with HTTP/2 RFC.
