Native Transport Netty Class Package Prefix

Motivation:
transport-native-epoll finds java classes from JNI using fully qualified class names. If a shaded version of Netty is used then these lookups will fail.

Modifications:
- Allow a prefix to be appended to Netty class names in JNI code.

Result:
JNI code can be used with shaded version of Netty.
