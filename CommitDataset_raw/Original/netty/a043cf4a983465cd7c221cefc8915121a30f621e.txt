Catch exceptions from PlatformDependent#getSystemClassLoader

Motivation:
PlatformDependent#getSystemClassLoader may throw a wide variety of exceptions based upon the environment. We should handle all exceptions and continue initializing the slow path if an exception occurs.

Modifications:
- Catch Throwable in cases where PlatformDependent#getSystemClassLoader is used

Result:
Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/6038
