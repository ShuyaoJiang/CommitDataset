[#2577] ChannelOutboundBuffer.addFlush() unnecessary loop through all entries on multiple calls

Motivation:

If ChannelOutboundBuffer.addFlush() is called multiple times and flushed != unflushed it will still loop through all entries that are not flushed yet even if it is not needed anymore as these were marked uncancellable before.

Modifications:

Check if new messages were added since addFlush() was called and only if this was the case loop through all entries and try to mark the uncancellable.

Result:

Less overhead when ChannelOuboundBuffer.addFlush() is called multiple times without new messages been added.
