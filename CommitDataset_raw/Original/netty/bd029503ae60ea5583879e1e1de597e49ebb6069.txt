asm 6.0_BETA was released so we should use it when building on java9

Motivation:

We used asm 6.0_ALPHA when building on java9 as the latest stable release not works with java9. asm 6.0_BETA was just released so we should update.

Modifications:

Upgrade asm version

Result:

Not use ALPHA release anymore
