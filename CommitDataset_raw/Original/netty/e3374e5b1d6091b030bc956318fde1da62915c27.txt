Removing direct access to HTTP/2 child streams.

Motivation:

We've removed access to the activeStreams collection, we should do the same for the children of a stream to provide a consistent interface.

Modifications:

Moved Http2StreamVisitor to a top-level interface. Removed unnecessary child operations from the Http2Stream interface so that we no longer require a map structure.

Result:

Cleaner and more consistent interface for iterating over child streams.
