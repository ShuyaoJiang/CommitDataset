Adjust Content-Length header when encoding Full Responses

Motivation:
If a full HttpResponse with a Content-Length header is encoded by the HttpContentEncoder subtypes the Content-Length header is removed and the message is set to Transfer-Encoder: chunked. This is an unnecessary loss of information about the message content.

Modifications:
- If a full HttpResponse has a Content-Length header, the header is adjusted after encoding.

Result:
Complete messages continue to have the Content-Length header after encoding.
