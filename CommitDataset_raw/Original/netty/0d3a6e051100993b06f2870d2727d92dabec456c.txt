HTTP/2 Decoder reduce preface conditional checks

Motivation:
The DefaultHttp2ConnectionDecoder class is calling verifyPrefaceReceived() for almost every frame event at all times.
The Http2ConnectionHandler class is calling readClientPrefaceString() on every decode event.

Modifications:
- DefaultHttp2ConnectionDecoder should not have to continuously call verifyPrefaceReceived() because it transitions boolean state 1 time for each connection.
- Http2ConnectionHandler should not have to continuously call readClientPrefaceString() because it transitions boolean state 1 time for each connection.

Result:
- Less conditional checks for the mainstream usage of the connection.
