Avoid infinite loop in HTTP/2 distributor toString()

Motivation:

Although effectively unused, the toString() of
WeightedFairQueueByteDistributor.State is useful for debugging. It
accidentally had an infinite loop, as it would recurse infinitely
between a parent and its child, which makes it less useful for
debugging.

Modifications:

Prune the infinite loop by using the parent's streamId instead of the
parent's toString().

Result:

Faster, less stack-overflowing toString()
