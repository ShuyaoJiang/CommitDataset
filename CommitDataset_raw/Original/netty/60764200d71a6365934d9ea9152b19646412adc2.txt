Do not throw an exception when failed to get a header

Motivation:

It is often very expensive to instantiate an exception. TextHeader
should not raise an exception when it failed to find a header or when
its header value is not valid.

Modification:

- Change the return type of the getter methods to Integer and Long so
  that null is returned when no header is found or its value is invalid
- Update Javadoc

Result:

- Fixes #2758
- No unnecessary instantiation of exceptions
