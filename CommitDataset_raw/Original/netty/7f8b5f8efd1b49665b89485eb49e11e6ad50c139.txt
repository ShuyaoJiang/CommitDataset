[#4351] Add warnings for Attribute.remove() and Attribute.getAndRemove()

Motivation:

Using Attribute.remove() and Attribute.getAndRemove() in a multi-threaded enviroment has its drawbacks. Make sure we document these.

Modifications:

Add javadocs and mark Attribute.remove() and Attribute.getAndRemove() as @Deprecated.

Result:

Hopefully less suprising behaviour.
