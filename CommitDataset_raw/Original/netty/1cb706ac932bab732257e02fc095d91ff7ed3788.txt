HTTP/2 HPACK Header Name Validation and Trailing Padding

Motivation:
The HPACK code currently disallows empty header names. This is not explicitly forbidden by the HPACK RFC https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7541. However the HTTP/1.x RFC https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2 and thus HTTP/2 both disallow empty header names, and so this precondition check should be moved from the HPACK code to the protocol level.
HPACK also requires that string literals which are huffman encoded must be treated as an encoding error if the string has more than 7 trailing padding bits https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7541#section-5.2, but this is currently not enforced.

Result:
- HPACK to allow empty header names
- HTTP/1.x and HTTP/2 header validation should not allow empty header names
- Enforce max of 7 trailing padding bits

Result:
Code is more compliant with the above mentioned RFCs
