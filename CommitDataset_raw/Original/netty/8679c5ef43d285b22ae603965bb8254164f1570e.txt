CleanerJava9 should be able to do its job even with a SecurityManager installed. (#8204)

Motivation:

CleanerJava9 currently fails whever a SecurityManager is installed. We should make use of AccessController.doPrivileged(...) so the user can give it the correct rights.

Modifications:

Use doPrivileged(...) when needed.

Result:

Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/8201.
