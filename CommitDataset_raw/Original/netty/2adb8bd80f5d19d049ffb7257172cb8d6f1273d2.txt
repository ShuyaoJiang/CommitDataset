Use Parameterized to run SslHandler tests with different SslProviders.

Motivation:

At the moment use loops to run SslHandler tests with different SslProviders which is error-prone and also make it difficult to understand with which provider these failed.

Modifications:

- Move unit tests that should run with multiple SslProviders to extra class.
- Use junit Parameterized to run with different SslProvider combinations

Result:

Easier to understand which SslProvider produced test failures
