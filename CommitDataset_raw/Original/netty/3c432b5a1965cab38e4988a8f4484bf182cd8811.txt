TCP_NOTSENT_LOWAT older kernel compatibility

Motiviation:
TCP_NOTSENT_LOWAT is only supported in linux kernel 3.12 or newer. The addition of this socket option prevents older kernels from building.

Modifications:
- Conditionally define TCP_NOTSENT_LOWAT if it is not defined

Result:
Kernels older than 3.12 can still compile the EPOLL module.
