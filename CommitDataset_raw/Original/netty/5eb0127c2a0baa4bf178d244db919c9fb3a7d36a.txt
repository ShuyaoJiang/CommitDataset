A new ChannelHandler that allows the user to control the flow of messages if upstream handlers emit more than one event for each read()

Motivation:

Some handlers such as HttpObjectDecoder can emit more than one event per read()
which leads to problems in downstream handlers that expect only one event and hope
that ChannelConfig#setAutoRead(false) prevents further events being sent while they're
processing the one they've just received.

Modifications:

A new handler called FlowControlHandler that feeds off read() and isAutoRead() and acts
as a holding buffer if auto reading gets turned off and more events arrive while auto reading
is off.

Result:

Fixes issues such as #4895.
