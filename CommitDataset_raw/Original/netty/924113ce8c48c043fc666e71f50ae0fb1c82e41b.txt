Make DefaultEventExecutor usable by users.

Motivation:

There's no reason to keep our users from using DefaultEventExecutor directly.  It should be actually very useful to them.

Modifications:

Make DefaultEventExecutor public and add useful public constructors.

Result:

DefaultEventExecutor got usable by anyone, yielding more value as a generic library.
