EDNS Client Subnet is not encoded correctly when source prefix length is not a multiple of 8.

Motivation:
When the ECS source prefix length is not a mutiple of 8, the last byte the address inside the
ECS OPT record is not padded properly.

Modifications:
DefaultDnsRecordEncoder.padWithZeros(...) was modified to add padding from the least
significant bits.

Result:
ECS encoding bug fixed.
