Fixed rfc violation about sending extension frame in the middle of headers

Motivation:

At rfc7540 5.5, it said that it's not permitted to send extension
frame in the middle of header block and need be treated as
protocol error

Modifications:

When received a extension frame, in netty it's called unknown frame,
will verify that is there an headersContinuation exists

Result:

When received a extension frame in the middle of header block,
will throw connection error and closed the connection
