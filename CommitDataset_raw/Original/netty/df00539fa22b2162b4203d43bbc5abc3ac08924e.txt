Allow to load PrivateKey via OpenSSL Engine (#8200)

Motivation:

OpenSSL itself has an abstraction which allows you to customize some things. For example it is possible to load the PrivateKey from the engine. We should support this.

Modifications:

Add two new static methods to OpenSslX509KeyManagerFactory which allow to create an OpenSslX509KeyManagerFactory that loads its PrivateKey via the OpenSSL Engine directly.

Result:

More flexible usage of OpenSSL possible
