[#6141] OpenSSLContext Mutual Auth does not announce acceptable CAs

Motivation:

Openssl provider should behave same as JDK provider when mutual authentication is required and a specific set of trusted Certificate Authorities are specified. The SSL handshake should return back to the connected peer the same list of configured Certificate Authorities.

Modifications:

Correctly set the CA list.

Result:

Correct and same behaviour as the JDK implementation.
