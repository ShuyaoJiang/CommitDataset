Make results of handler proxy tests reproducible

Motivation:

`ProxyHandlerTest` relies on random values to run tests: first to
shuffle collection of test items and lately to set configuration
flag for `AUTO_READ`. While the purpose of randomization is clear,
it's still impossible to reproduce the same sequence of test cases
when something went wrong. For `AUTO_READ` it's even impossible
to tell what flag was set when the particular test failed.

Modifications:

* Test runner now log seed values that was used for shuffling,
  so you can take one and put in your tests to "freeze" them
  while debugging (pretty common approach with randomized tests)

* `SuccessItemTest` is split into 2 different use cases:
  for AUTO_READ flag set to "on" and "off"

Result:

You can reproduce specific tests results now.
