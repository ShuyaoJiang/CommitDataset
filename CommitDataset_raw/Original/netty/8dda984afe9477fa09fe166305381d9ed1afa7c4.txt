Null out references to tmpNioBuf and chunk to allow quicker collecting

Motivation:

In PooledByteBuf we missed to null out the chunk and tmpNioBuf fields before recycle it to the Recycler. This could lead to keep objects longer alive then necessary which may hold a lot of memory.

Modifications:

Null out tmpNioBuf and chunk before recycle.

Result:

Possible to earlier GC objects.
