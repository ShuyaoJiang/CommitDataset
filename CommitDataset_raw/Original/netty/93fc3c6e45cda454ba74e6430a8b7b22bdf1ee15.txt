Make IntObjectHashMap extend Map

Motivation:

It would be useful to support the Java `Map` interface in our primitive maps.

Modifications:

Renamed current methods to "pXXX", where p is short for "primitive". Made the template for all primitive maps extend the appropriate Map interface.

Result:

Fixes #3970
