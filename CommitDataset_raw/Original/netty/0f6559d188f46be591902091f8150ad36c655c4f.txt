[#3780] Handle ChannelInitializer exception in exceptionCaught()

Motivation:

At the moment we directly closed the Channel when an exception accoured durring initChannel(...) without giving the user any way to do extra or special handling.

Modifications:

Handle the exception in exceptionCaught(...) of the ChannelInitializer which will by default log and close the Channel. This way the user can override this.

Result:

More felixible handling of exceptions.
