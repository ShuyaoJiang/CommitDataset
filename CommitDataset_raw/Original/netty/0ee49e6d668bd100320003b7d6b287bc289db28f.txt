Eliminate noisy logging when using sun.misc.Unsafe and running on pre Java9

Motivation:

We should only try to load jdk.internal.misc.Unsafe if we run on Java9+ to eliminate noise in the log.

Modifications:

- Move javaVersion() and related methods to PlatformDependent0 to be able to use these in the static initializer without creating a cycle.
- Only try to load jdk.internal.misc.Unsafe when running in Java9+

Result:

Less noise in the log when running pre java9.
