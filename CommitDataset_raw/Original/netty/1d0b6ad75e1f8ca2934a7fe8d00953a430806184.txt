DefaultPromiseTest dead code removal

Motivation:
DefaultPromiseTest has dead code which was left over from a code restructure. Shared code between 2 tests was moved into a common method, but some code which was not cleaned up in each of these methods after the code was moved.

Modifications:
- Delete dead code in DefaultPromiseTest

Result:
Less dead code
