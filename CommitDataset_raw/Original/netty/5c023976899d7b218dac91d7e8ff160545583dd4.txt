Support private key encrypted with empty password

Motivation:

A user may use a private key which is encrypted with an empty password. Because of this we should only handle a null password in a special way.

Modifications:

- Correctly handle private key that is encrypted with empty password.
- Make OpenSsl*Context implementions consistent in terms of initialization in the constructor.

Result:

Correctly support private key that is encrypted with empty password.
