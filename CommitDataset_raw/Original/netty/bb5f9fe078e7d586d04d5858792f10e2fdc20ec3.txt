Scoring loopback addresses as 0 in DefaultChannelId

Motivation:

As described in #3490, [compareAddresses](https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/master/transport/src/main/java/io/netty/channel/DefaultChannelId.java#L182)  seems to allow loopback addresses to score high, disallowing replacing the loopback address.

Modifications:

Changed [scoreAddress](https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/master/transport/src/main/java/io/netty/channel/DefaultChannelId.java#L283) to score loopback addresses as 0.

Result:

Fixes #3490
