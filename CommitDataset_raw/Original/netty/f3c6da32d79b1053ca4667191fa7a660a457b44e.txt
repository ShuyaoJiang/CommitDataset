Fix concurrency issue in DnsNameResolver when DefaultDnsCache is used.

Motivation:

We need to ensure we only call List.* methods in the synchronized block as the returned List may not be thread-safe.

Modifications:

Do not call isEmpty() outside of the synchronized block.

Result:

Fixes [#7583]
