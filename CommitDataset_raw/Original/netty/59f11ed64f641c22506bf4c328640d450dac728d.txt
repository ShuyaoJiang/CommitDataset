Optimize AbstractChannel and related classes

- AbstractChannel.doRead() is split into two versions so that the
  implementation doesn't have to validate the buffer type.
- Optimized ChannelBufferHolder a little bit
- Reduced GC related with flush future notification
  - Added FlushCheckpoint and DefaultChannelFuture implements it
    opportunistically
