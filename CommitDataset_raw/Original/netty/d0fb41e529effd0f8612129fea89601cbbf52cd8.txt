Adjust testsuite-osgi to resolve bundles from local build (#8944)

Motivation:

testsuite-osgi currently resolve its bundles from the local / remote maven repository, which means you will need to do `mvn install` before it can pick up the bundles. Beside this this also means that you may pick up old versions if you forgot to call `install` before running it.

Modifications:

Use alta-maven-plugin to be able to resolve bundles from the local build directory during the build.

Result:

No need to install jars before running the OSGI testsuite and ensure we always test with the latest jars.
