Strict thread model / Allow assign an executor to a handler

- Add EventExecutor and make EventLoop extend it
- Add SingleThreadEventExecutor and MultithreadEventExecutor
- Add EventExecutor's default implementation
- Fixed an API design problem where there is no way to get non-bypass
  buffer of desired type
