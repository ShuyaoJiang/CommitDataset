Http2ConnectionDecoder remove localSettings setter method

Motivation:
Http2ConnectionDecoder#localSettings(Http2Settings) is not used in codec-http2 and currently results in duplicated code.

Modifications:
- Remove Http2ConnectionDecoder#localSettings(Http2Settings)

Result:
Smaller interface and less duplicated code.
