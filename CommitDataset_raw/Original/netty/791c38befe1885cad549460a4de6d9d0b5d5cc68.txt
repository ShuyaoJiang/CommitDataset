[#2359] EpollSocketChannel.remoteAddress0() is always null on accepted EpollSocketChannels

Motivation:
EpollSocketChannel.remoteAddress0() is always null on accepted EpollSocketChannels as we not set it excplicit.

Modifications:
Correctly retrieve the local and remote address when accept new channel and store it

Result:
EpollSocketchannel.remoteAddress0() and EpollSocketChannel.localAddress0() return correct addresses
