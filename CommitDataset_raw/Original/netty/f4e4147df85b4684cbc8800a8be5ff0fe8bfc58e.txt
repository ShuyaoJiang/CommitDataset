LocationAwareSlf4jLogger does not correctly format log message. (#8595)

Motivation:

We did miss to use MessageFormatter inside LocationAwareSlf4jLogger and so {} was not correctly replaced in log messages when using slf4j.
This regression was introduced by afe0767e9c150369cd6ea150b5cc1a9021fd5c3c.

Modifications:

- Make use of MessageFormatter
- Add unit test.

Result:

Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/8483.
