[#4373] Fix assert error when trying to release Channel to closed FixedChannelPool

Motivation:

Once a FixedChannelPool was closed we must not allow to acquire or release Channels to prevent assert errors.

Modifications:

Fail release and acquire calls when FixedChannelPool is closed.

Result:

No more assert errors.1
