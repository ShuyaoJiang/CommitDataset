[#1865] Only use internalNioBuffer when one of the read* or write* methods are used. This is neccessary to prevent races as those can happen when a slice or duplicate is shared between different Channels
that are not assigned to the same EventLoop. In general get* operations should always be safe to be used from different Threads.

This aslo include unit tests that show the issue
