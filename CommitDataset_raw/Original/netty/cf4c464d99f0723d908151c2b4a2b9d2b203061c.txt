Modify HttpObjectDecoder to allow parsing the HTTP headers in multiple steps.

Motivation:
At the moment the whole HTTP header must be parsed at once which can lead to multiple parsing of the same bytes. We can do better here and allow to parse it in multiple steps.

Modifications:

 - Not parse headers multiple times
 - Simplify the code
 - Eliminate uncessary String[] creations
 - Use readSlice(...).retain() when possible.

Result:

Performance improvements as shown in the included benchmark below.
