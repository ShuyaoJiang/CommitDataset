[#3687] Correctly store WebSocketServerHandshaker in Channel attributes

Motivation:

As we stored the WebSocketServerHandshaker in the ChannelHandlerContext it was always null and so no close frame was send if WebSocketServerProtocolHandler was used.

Modifications:

Store WebSocketServerHAndshaker in the Channel attributes and so make it visibile between different handlers.

Result:

Correctly send close frame.
