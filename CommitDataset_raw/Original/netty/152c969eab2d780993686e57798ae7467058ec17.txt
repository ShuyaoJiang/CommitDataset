Make Bootstrap and ServerBootstrap thread-safe

- Additional fix for: #970
- Use LinkedHashMap again to save memory consumption
- ServerBootstrap now makes a copy of child parameters so that modifying ServerBootstrap after bind() does not affect the already-bound servers. This also makes child channel initialization potentially faster due to reduced garbage iterator.
