Strip http 'expect' headers when expectation response is produced

Motivation:

HttpObjectAggregator differs from HttpServerExpectContinueHandler's handling
of expect headers by not stripping the 'expect' header when a response
is generated.

Modifications:

HttpObjectAggregator now removes the 'expect' header in cases where it generates
a response.

Result:

Consistent and correct behavior between HttpObjectAggregator and HttpServerExpectContinueHandler.
