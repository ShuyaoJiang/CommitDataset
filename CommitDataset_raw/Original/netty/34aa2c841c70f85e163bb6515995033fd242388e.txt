Don't use sun.misc.Unsafe when IKVM.NET is used (#9042)

Motivation:

IKVM.NET seems to ship a bug sun.misc.Unsafe class, for this reason we should better disable our sun.misc.Unsafe usage when we detect IKVM.NET is used.

Modifications:

Check if IKVM.NET is used and if so do not use sun.misc.Unsafe by default.

Result:

Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/9035 and https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/8916.
