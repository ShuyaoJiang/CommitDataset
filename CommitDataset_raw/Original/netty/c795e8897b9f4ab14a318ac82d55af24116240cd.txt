Convert Http2Error.STREAM_CLOSED to ClosedChannelException when using child channels

Motivation:

We should convert Http2Exceptions that are produced because of STREAM_CLOSED to ClosedChannelException when hand-over to the child channel to make it more consistent with other transports.

Modifications:

- Check if STREAM_CLOSED is used and if so create a new ClosedChannelException (while preserve the original exception as cause) and use it in the child channel
- Ensure STREAM_CLOSED is used in DefaultHttp2RemoteFlowController when writes are failed because of a closed stream.
- Add testcase

Result:

More consistent and correct exception usage.
