Reject the first SETTINGS ack on HTTP/2 Preface

Motivation:

Http2ConnectionHandler verifies if the first frame after the preface is
a SETTINGS frame.  However, it does not reject the SETTING ack frame
which is not expected actually.

Modifications:

Reject a SETTINGS-ack frame as well

Result:

When the first frame is a SETTINGS-ack frame, connection does not
proceed to further frame handling. (simplicity)
