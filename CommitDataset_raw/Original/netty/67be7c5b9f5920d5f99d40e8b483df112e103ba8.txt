Log why it was not possible to use ByteBuffer.cleaner

Motivation:

We should log why we can not use ByteBuffer.cleaner and so maybe allow the user to fix it.

Modifications:

- Use Unsafe to access the field
- Log the exception when we can not use ByteBuffer.cleaner

Result:

Easier to debug why using cleaner is not possible.
