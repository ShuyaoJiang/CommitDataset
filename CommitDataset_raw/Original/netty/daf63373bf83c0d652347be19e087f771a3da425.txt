AbstractChannelHandlerContext doesn't need to extend DefaultAttributeMap (#8960)

Motivation:

It appears this was an oversight, maybe was valid at some point in the past. Noticed while reviewing #8958.

Modifications:

Change AbstractChannelHandlerContext to not extend DefaultAttributeMap.

Result:

Simpler hierarchy, eliminate unused attributes field from each context instance.
