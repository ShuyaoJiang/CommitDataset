Correct semantic of LocalChannel.doWrite(...) and remove memory copy

Motivation:

The semantic of LocalChannel.doWrite(...) were a bit off as it notified the ChannelFuture before the data was actual moved to the peer buffer.

Modifications:

- Use our MPSC queue as inbound buffer
- Directly copy to data to the inbound buffer of the peer and either success or fail the promise after each copy.

Result:

Correct semantic and less memory copies.
