Recognizing TLS Extension "HeartBeat" as Valid TLS Packet

Motivation:

The widely used SSL Implementation, OpenSSL, already supports Heartbeat Extension; both sending and responding to Heartbeat Messages. But, since Netty is not recognizing that extension as valid packet, peers won't be able to use this extension.

Modification:

Update SslUtils.java to recognize Heartbeat Extension as valid tls packet.

Result:

With this change, softwares using Netty + OpenSSL will be able to respond for TLS Heartbeat requests (actually taken care by OpenSSL - no need of any extra implementation from Clients)
