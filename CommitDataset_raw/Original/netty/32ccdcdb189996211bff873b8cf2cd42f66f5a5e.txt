Make sure the local / remote InetSocketAddres can be obtained. Part of [#2262]

Motivation:
Make sure the remote/local InetSocketAddress can be obtained correctly

Modifications:
Set the remote/local InetSocketAddress after a bind/connect operation was performed

Result:
It is possible to still access the informations even after the fd became invalid. This mirror the behaviour of NIO.
