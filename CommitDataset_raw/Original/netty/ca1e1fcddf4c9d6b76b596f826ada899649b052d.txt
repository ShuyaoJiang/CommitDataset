Only try to match SSLException message when debug logging is enabled.

Motivation:

We only want to log for the particular case when debug logging is enabled so we not need to try to match the message if this is not the case.

Modifications:

Guard with logger.isDebugEnabled()

Result:

Less overhead when debug logging is not enabled.
