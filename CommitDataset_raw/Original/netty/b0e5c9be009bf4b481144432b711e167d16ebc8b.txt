[#2605] Use SO_REUSEADDR on EpollServerSocketChannel to match defaults of java.nio.ServerSocketChannel impl

Motivation:

When using openjdk and oracle jdk's nio (while using the nio transport) the ServerSocketChannel uses SO_REUSEADDR by default. Our native transport should do the same to make it easier to switch between the different implementations and get the expected result.

Modification:

Change EpollServerSocketChannelConfig to set SO_REUSEADDR on the created socket.

Result:

SO_REUSEADDR is used by default on servers.
