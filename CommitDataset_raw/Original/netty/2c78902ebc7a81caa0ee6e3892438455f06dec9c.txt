LzmaFrameEncoderTest leak due to LzmaInputStream close behavior

Motivation:
c1932a8537b742aaf15a7cfacf9f76ad8239f3c7 made an assumption that the LzmaInputStream which wraps a ByteBufInputStream would delegate the close operation to the wrapped stream. This assumption is not true and thus we still had a leak. An issue has been logged with our LZMA dependency https://github.com/jponge/lzma-java/issues/14.

Modifications:
- Force a close on the wrapped stream

Result:
No more leak.
