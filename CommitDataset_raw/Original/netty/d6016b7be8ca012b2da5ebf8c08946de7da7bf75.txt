[#3457] Proper fix for IllegalStateException caused by closed file descriptor / channel

Motivation:

During 6b941e9bdbc1b1a9090c280bc6c44903ff7c7b67 I introduced a regression that could cause an IllegalStateException.
A non-proper fix was commited as part of #3443. This commit add a proper fix.

Modifications:

Remove FileDescriptor.INVALID and add FileDescriptor.isOpen() as replacement. Once FileDescriptor.close() is called isOpen() will return false.

Result:

No more IllegalStateException caused by a close channel.
