AbstractByteBuf.ensureWritable(...) should check if buffer was released

Motivation:

AbstractByteBuf.ensureWritable(...) should check if buffer was released and if so throw an IllegalReferenceCountException

Modifications:

Ensure we throw in all cases.

Result:

More consistent and correct behaviour
