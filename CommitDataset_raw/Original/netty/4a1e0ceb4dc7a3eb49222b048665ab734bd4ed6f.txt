[5382] HttpContentEncoder should not set chunked transfer-encoding for HTTP/1.0

Motivation:

When using HttpContentCompressor and the HttpResponse is protocol version 1.0, HttpContentEncoder.encode() should not set the transfer-encoding header to chunked. Chunked transfer-encoding is not valid for HTTP 1.0 - this causes ERR_CONTENT_DECODING_FAILED errors in chrome and similar failures in IE.

Modifications:

Skip HTTP/1.0 messages

Result:

Be able to serve HTTP/1.0 as well when HttpContentEncoder is in the pipeline.
