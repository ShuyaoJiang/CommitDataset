Improved error message in FixedChannelPool

Motivation:

`FixedChannelPool` allows users to configure `acquireTimeoutMillis`
and expects given value to be greater or equal to zero when timeout
action is supplied. However, validation error message said that
value is expected to be greater or equal to one. Code performs
check against zero.

Modifications:

Changed error message to say that value greater or equal to
zero is expected. Added test to check that zero is an acceptable
value.

Result:

Exception with right error message is thrown.
