Make CompatibleMarshallingDecoder discard the inbound buffer once TooLongFrameException is raised

(See #768)

Once too long object is received, CompatibleMarshallingDecoder has to
discard all input from now on, just like MarshallingDecoder does.
Otherwise, the decoder will raise more exceptions because the decoder
has no idea anymore where the object starts.

Before this fix, SerialThreadLocalCompatibleMarshallingDecoderTest
logged many additional exceptions raised by the decoder after test is
finished.
