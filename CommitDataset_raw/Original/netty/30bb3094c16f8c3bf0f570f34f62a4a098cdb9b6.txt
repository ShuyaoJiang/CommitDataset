[#5227] Fix race-condition in PooledByteBufAllocatorTest

Motivation:

PooledByteBufAllocatorTest.testNumThreadCachesWithNoDirrectArenas() had a race as it just used LockSupport.parkNanos(). We should better use a CountdownLatch and so be sure we really have init everything.

Modifications:

Replace LockSupport.parkNanos(...) with CountdownLatch usage

Result:

No more race in test.
