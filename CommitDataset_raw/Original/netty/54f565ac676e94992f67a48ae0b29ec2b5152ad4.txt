Allow to use native transports when sun.misc.Unsafe is not present onâ€¦ (#8231)

* Allow to use native transports when sun.misc.Unsafe is not present on the system

Motivation:

We should be able to use the native transports (epoll / kqueue) even when sun.misc.Unsafe is not present on the system. This is especially important as Java11 will be released soon and does not allow access to it by default.

Modifications:

- Correctly disable usage of sun.misc.Unsafe when -PnoUnsafe is used while running the build
- Correctly increment metric when UnpooledDirectByteBuf is allocated. This was uncovered once -PnoUnsafe usage was fixed.
- Implement fallbacks in all our native transport code for when sun.misc.Unsafe is not present.

Result:

Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/8229.
