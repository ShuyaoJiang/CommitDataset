Add support for ExtensionRegistryLite in ProtobufDecoder

Motivation:

ExtensionRegistry is a subclass of ExtensionRegistryLite.  The ProtobufDecoder
doesn't use the registry directly, it simply passes it through to the Protobuf
API.  The Protobuf calls in question are themselves written in terms
ExtensionRegistryLite not ExtensionRegistry.

Modifications:

Require ExtensionRegistryLite instead of ExtensionRegistry in ProtobufDecoder.

Result:

Consumers can use ExtensionRegistryLite with ProtobufDecoder.
