Expose channel count for FixedChannelPool (#8059)

Motivation:

We use FixedChannelPool in production, and we believe we have a leak that doesn't return sockets to the pool (but they should be closed), thus blocking us from creating new connections when we need them. I haven't confirmed this yet, but right now I have to resort to reflection to access this field which makes me sad.

Modification:

Expose the acquiredChannelCount field through a getter method.

Result:

Allows introspection of the pool size in FixedChannelPool.
