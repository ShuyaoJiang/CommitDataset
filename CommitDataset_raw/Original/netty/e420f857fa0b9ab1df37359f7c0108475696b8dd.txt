Optimize DefaultHeaders#toString and implement HttpHeaders#toString

Motivation:

For debugging/logging purpose, it would be convenient to have
HttpHeaders#toString implemented.

DefaultHeaders does implement toString be the implementation is suboptimal and allocates a Set for the names and Lists for values.

Modification:

* Introduce HeadersUtil#toString that provides a convenient optimized helper to implement toString for various headers implementations
* Have DefaultHeaders#toString and HttpHeaders#toString delegate their toString implementation to HeadersUtil

Result:

Convenient HttpHeaders#toString. Optimized DefaultHeaders#toString.
