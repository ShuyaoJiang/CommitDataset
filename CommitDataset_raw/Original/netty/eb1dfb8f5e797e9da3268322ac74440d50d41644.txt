SingleThreadEventLoopTest failures

Motivation:
Some unit tests in SingleThreadEventLoopTest rely upon Thread.sleep for sequencing events between threads. This can be unreliable and result in spurious test failures if thread scheduling does not occur in a fair predictable manner.

Modifications:
- Reduce the reliance on Thread.sleep in SingleThreadEventLoopTest

Result:
Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/5851
