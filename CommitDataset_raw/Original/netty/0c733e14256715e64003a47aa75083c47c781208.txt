[#2363] Correctly null out SelectionKey[] when selectAgain

Motivation:

The prefix fix of #2363 did not correctly handle the case when selectAgain is true and so missed to null out entries.

Modifications:

Move the i++ from end of loop to beginning of loop

Result:

Entries in the array will be null out so allow to have these GC'ed once the Channel close
