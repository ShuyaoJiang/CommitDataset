Add interopt tests between Conscrypt and OpenSSL SSLEngine implementations. (#8919)

Motivation:

In the past we found a lot of SSL related bugs because of the interopt tests we have in place between different SSLEngine implementations. We should have as many of these interopt tests as possible for this reason.

Modifications:

- Add interopt tests between Conscrypt and OpenSSL SSLEngine implementations

Result:

More tests for SSL.
