Selective Message Aggregation (#8793)

Motivation

Implementations of MessageAggregator (HttpObjectAggregator in particular) may wish to
selectively aggrerage requests and responses on a case-by-case basis such as for example
only POST requests or only responses of a certain content-type.

Modifications

Adding a flag to MessageAggregator that toggles between true/false depending on if aggregation
is desired for the current message or not.

Result

Fixes #8772
