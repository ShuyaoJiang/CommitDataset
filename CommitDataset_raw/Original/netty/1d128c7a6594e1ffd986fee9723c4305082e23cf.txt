Switch to netty-tcnative 2.0.0 which uses different package names

Motivation:

Previous versions of netty-tcnative used the org.apache.tomcat namespace which could lead to problems when a user tried to use tomcat and netty in the same app.

Modifications:

Use netty-tcnative which now uses a different namespace and adjust code to some API changes.

Result:

Its now possible to use netty-tcnative even when running together with tomcat.
