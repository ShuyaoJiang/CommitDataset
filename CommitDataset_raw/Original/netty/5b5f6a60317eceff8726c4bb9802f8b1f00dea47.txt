Allow non-default Http/2 server initial settings

Motivation:

Currently it is not possible to have an Http/2 server send non default
initial settings to clients when doing the initial connection handshake

Modifications:

Add additional constructors to Http2Codec allowing users to specify the
initial settings to send to the client and apply locally

Result:

You can now specify non default initial settings
