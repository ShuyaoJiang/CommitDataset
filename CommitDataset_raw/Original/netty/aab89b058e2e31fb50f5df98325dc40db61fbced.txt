Ensure Netty is usable on Java7

Motivation:

When adding SNIMatcher support we missed to use static delegating methods and so may try to load classes that not exists in Java7. Which will lead to errors.

Modifications:

- Correctly only try to load classes when running on java8+
- Ensure Java8+ related tests only run when using java8+

Result:

Fixes [#6700]
