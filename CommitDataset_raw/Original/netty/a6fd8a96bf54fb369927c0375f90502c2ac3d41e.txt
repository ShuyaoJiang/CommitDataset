Set default CONTENT_TYPE when it is absent in multipart request body

Motivation:

I am use netty as a http server, it fail to decode some POST request when the request absent Content-Type in the multipart/form-data body.

Modifications:

Set content_type with default application/octet-stream to parse the uploaded file data when the Content-Type is absent in multipart request body

Result:

Can decode the http request as normal.
