[#5892] Correct handle HttpMessage that is EOF terminated

Motivation:

We need to ensure we not add the Transfer-Encoding header if the HttpMessage is EOF terminated.

Only add the Transfer-Encoding header if an Content-Length header is present.

Result:

Correctly handle HttpMessage that is EOF terminated.
