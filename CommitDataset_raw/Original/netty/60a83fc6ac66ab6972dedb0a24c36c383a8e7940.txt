Fix packagine issues in all-in-one JAR

Motivation:

- dependencyVersionsDir property is not resolved during the build
  process. The build doesn't fail because of this, but it creates an
  ugly directory.
- All-in-one JAR contains libnetty-tcnative.so, which is not part of the
  all-in-one JAR.

Modifications:

- Fix an incorrect property name
  (dependencyVersionDir -> dependencyVersionsDir)
- Exclude libnetty-tcnative.so
- Remove unnecessary includes in source expanding configuration

Result:

- Cleaner pom.xml
- We do not ship libnetty-tcnative.so in all-in-one JAR anymore, which
  is correct, because strictly speaking the native library belongs to
  org.apache.tomcat.jni package.
