Cleanup transport-native-epoll code.

Motivation:

The code of transport-native-epoll missed some things in terms of static keywords, @deprecated annotations and other minor things.

Modifications:

- Add missing @deprecated annotation
- Not using FQCN in javadocs
- Add static keyword where possible
- Use final fields when possible
- Remove throws IOException from method where it is not needed.

Result:

Cleaner code.
