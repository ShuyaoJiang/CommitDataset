Allow to write CompositeByteBuf directly via EpollDatagramChannel. Related to [#2719]

Motivation:

On linux it is possible to use the sendMsg(...) system call to write multiple buffers with one system call when using datagram/udp.

Modifications:

- Implement the needed changes and make use of sendMsg(...) if possible for max performance
- Add tests that test sending datagram packets with all kind of different ByteBuf implementations.

Result:

Performance improvement when using CompoisteByteBuf and EpollDatagramChannel.
