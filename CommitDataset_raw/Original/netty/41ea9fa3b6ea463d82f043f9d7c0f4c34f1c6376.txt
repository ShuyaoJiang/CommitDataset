Ensure SSLErrorTest also works with boringssl

Motivation:

boringssl uses different messages for the ssl alerts which are all uppercase. As we try to match case as well this fails in SSLErrorTest as we expect lower-case.

This test was introduced by 9b7fb2f3620449c8cfafa62fd294cb82600f043a.

Modifications:

Ensure we first translate everything to lower-case before doing the assert.

Result:

SSLErrorTest also pass when boringssl is used.
