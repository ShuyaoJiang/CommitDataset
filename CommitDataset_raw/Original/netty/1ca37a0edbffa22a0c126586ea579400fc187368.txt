Correctly detect exeception cause when using BoringSSL in SslErrorTest (#8970)

Motivation:

e9ce5048dfdfed32df28e46fae6e766d8fd6d734 added a testcase to ensure we correctly send the alert in all cases but did use a too strict message matching which did not work for BoringSSL as it not uses whitespaces but underscores.

Modifications:

Make the message matching less strict.

Result:

Test pass also when using BoringSSL.
