Revert "Only call ctx.fireChannelReadComplete() if ByteToMessageDecoder decoded at least one message."

This reverts commit d63bb4811ed8ccd5d9e45853f3ac6aee9da7ecab as this not covered correctly all cases and so could lead to missing fireChannelReadComplete() calls. We will re-evalute d63bb4811ed8ccd5d9e45853f3ac6aee9da7ecab and resbumit a pr once we are sure all is handled correctly
