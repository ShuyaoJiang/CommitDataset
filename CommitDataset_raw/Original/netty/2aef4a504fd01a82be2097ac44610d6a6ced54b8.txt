Minimize object allocation when calling AbstractByteBuf.toString(..., Charset)

Motivation:

Calling AbstractByteBuf.toString(..., Charset) is used quite frequently by users but produce a lot of GC.

Modification:

- Use a FastThreadLocal to store the CharBuffer that are needed for decoding.
- Use internalNioBuffer(...) when possible

Result:

Less object creation / Less GC
