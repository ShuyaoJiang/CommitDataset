[#3888] Use 2 * cores as default minimum for pool arenas.

Motivation:

At the moment we use 1 * cores as default mimimum for pool arenas. This can easily lead to conditions as we use 2 * cores as default for EventLoop's when using NIO or EPOLL. If we choose a smaller number we will run into hotspots as allocation and deallocation needs to be synchronized on the PoolArena.

Modifications:

Change the default number of arenas to 2 * cores.

Result:

Less conditions when using the default settings.
