TCP_NOTSENT_LOWAT socket option support

Motiviation:
Linux provides the TCP_NOTSENT_LOWAT socket option. This can be used to control how much unsent data is queued in the tcp kernel buffers. This can be important when application level protocols (SPDY, HTTP/2) have their own priority mechanism and don't want data queued in the kernel.

Modifications:
- The epoll module will have an additional socket option TCP_NOTSENT_LOWAT
- There will be JNI methods to control the underlying linux socket option mechanism

Result:
Linux EPOLL module exposes the TCP_NOTSENT_LOWAT socket option.
