Use AuthoritativeDnsServerCache for creating the new redirect stream. (#8316)

* Use AuthoritativeDnsServerCache for creating the new redirect stream.

Motivation:

At the moment if a user wants to provide custom sorting of the nameservers used for redirects it needs to be implemented in two places. This is more complicated as it needs to be.

Modifications:

- Just delegate to the AuthoritativeDnsServerCache always as we fill it before we call newRedirectDnsServerStream anyway.

Result:

Easier way for the user to implement custom sorting.
