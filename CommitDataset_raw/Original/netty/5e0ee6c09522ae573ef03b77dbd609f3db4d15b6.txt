Fix missing ResourceLeak.close() in AbstractDnsMessage

Motivation:

ResourceLeak.close() must be called when a reference-counted resource is
deallocated, but AbstractDnsMessage.deallocate() forgot to call it.

Modifications:

Call ResourceLeak.close() for the tracked AbstractDnsMessage instances

Result:

Fix the false resource leak warnings
