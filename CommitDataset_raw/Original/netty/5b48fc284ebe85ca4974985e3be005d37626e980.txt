Make OIO/NIO/EPOLL autoReadClear consistent

Motivation:
OIO/NIO use a volatile variable to track if a read is pending. EPOLL does not use a volatile an executes a Runnable on the event loop thread to set readPending to false. These mechansims should be consistent, and not using a volatile variable is preferable because the variable is written to frequently in the event loop thread.
OIO also does not set readPending to false before each fireChannelRead operation and may result in reading more data than the user desires.

Modifications:
- OIO/NIO should not use a volatile variable for readPending
- OIO should set readPending to false before each fireChannelRead

Result:
OIO/NIO/EPOLL are more consistent w.r.t. readPending and volatile variable operations are reduced
