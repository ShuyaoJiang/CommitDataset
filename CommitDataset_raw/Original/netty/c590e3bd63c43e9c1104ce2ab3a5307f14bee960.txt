HTTP/2 relax test timeouts

Motivation:
Build failures have been observed with 2 second timeouts on the CI servers. We should make the timeouts longer to reduce false positive test failures due to tests timing out prematurely.

Modifications:
- Increase timeouts from 2 and 3 seconds to 5 seconds.

Result:
Less false positive test failures.
