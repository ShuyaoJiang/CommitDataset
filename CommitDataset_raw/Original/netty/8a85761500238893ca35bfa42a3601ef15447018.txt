Don't use VM.maxDirectMemory() on IBM J9 / Eclipse OpenJ9 to retrieve direct memory limit (#7966)

Motivation:

On J9 / OpenJ9 netty initializes this value with 64M, even the direct accessible memory is actually unbounded.

Modifications:

Skip usage of VM.maxDirectMemory() on J9 / OpenJ9

Result:

More correct direct memory limit detection. Fixes #7654.
