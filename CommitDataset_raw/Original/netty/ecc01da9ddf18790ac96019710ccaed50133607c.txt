[#3968] Disallow pass-through of non ByteBufs in SslHandler

Motivation:

We pass-through non ByteBuf when SslHandler.write(...) is called which can lead to have unencrypted data to be send (like for example if a FileRegion is written).

Modifications:

- Fail ChannelPromise with UnsupportedMessageException if a non ByteBuf is written.

Result:

Only allow ByteBuf to be written when using SslHandler.
