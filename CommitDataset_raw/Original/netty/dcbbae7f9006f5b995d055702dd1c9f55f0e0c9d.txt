Added QueryStringDecoder.rawPath() and rawQuery()

Motivation:

Before this commit, it is impossible to access the path component of the
URI before it has been decoded.  This makes it impossible to distinguish
between the following URIs:

/user/title?key=value
/user%2Ftitle?key=value

The user could already access the raw uri value, but they had to calculate
pathEndIdx themselves, even though it might already be cached inside
QueryStringDecoder.

Result:

The user can easily and efficiently access the undecoded path and query.
