Use Triple DES in JdkSslContext cipher suite list.

Motivation:

JdkSslContext used SSL_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA in its cipher suite list.
OpenSslServerContext used DES-CBC3-SHA in the same place in its cipher suite
list, which is equivalent to SSL_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA.

This means the lists were out of sync. Furthermore, using
SSL_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA is not desirable as it uses DES, a weak cipher. Triple
DES should be used instead.

Modifications:

Replace SSL_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA with SSL_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA in
JdkSslContext.

Result:

The JdkSslContext and OpenSslServerContext cipher suite lists are now in sync.
Triple DES is used instead of DES, which is stronger.
