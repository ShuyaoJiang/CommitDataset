Add a new constructor without handler parameter to TrafficCounter

Related: #3476

Motivation:

Some users use TrafficCounter for other uses than we originally
intended, such as implementing their own traffic shaper.  In such a
case, a user does not want to specify an AbstractTrafficShapingHandler.

Modifications:

- Add a new constructor that does not require an
  AbstractTrafficShapingHandler, so that a user can use it without it.
- Simplify TrafficMonitoringTask
- Javadoc cleanup

Result:

We open the possibility of using TrafficCounter for other purposes than
just using it with AbstractTrafficShapingHandler.  Eventually, we could
generalize it a little bit more, so that we can potentially use it for
other uses.
