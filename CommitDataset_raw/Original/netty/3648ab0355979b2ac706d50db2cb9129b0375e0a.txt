Add comments for ApplicationProtocolConfig

Motivation:
The behavior for SelectorFailureBehavior and SelectedListenerFailureBehavior enum values are not clear. Additional comments would clarify the expected behavior.

Modifications:
- Add comments for each value in SelectedListenerFailureBehavior and SelectorFailureBehavior which clarify the expected behavior

Result:
The behavior of SelectedListenerFailureBehavior and SelectorFailureBehavior are more clearly communicated.
