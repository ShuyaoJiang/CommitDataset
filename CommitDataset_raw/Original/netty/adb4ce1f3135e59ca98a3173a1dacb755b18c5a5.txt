Use MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.6 when compile native transport on MacOS (#8379)

Motivation:

MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.6 needs to be used as everything before is not supported in 10.14 anymore. 10.6 was released 2009 so this should be a safe thing to do.

Modifications:

Use MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.6

Result:

Be able to compile on MacOS 10.14
