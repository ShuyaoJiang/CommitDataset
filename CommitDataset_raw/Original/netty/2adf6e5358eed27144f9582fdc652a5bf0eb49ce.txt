Better parsing for STOMP body with no length.

Motivation:

The STOMP decoder used to fail when parsing a frame with no content-length
and a body split across multiple packets.

Modifications:

Support contentLength of -1 (indicating indeterminate length) and added a
check to getContentLength.  Moved the NUL byte searching from the
readHeaders() method out to the main decoder loop.

Result:

A STOMP frame can be properly parsed even if it's missing the
content-length header and the NUL byte is in a later packet.
