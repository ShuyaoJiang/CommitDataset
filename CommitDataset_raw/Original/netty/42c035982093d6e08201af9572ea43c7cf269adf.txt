Do not prefer empty MAC address

Motivation:

When comparing MAC addresses searching for the best MAC address, if
locally-administered address (e.g., from a Docker container) is compared
against an empty MAC address, the empty MAC address will be marked as
preferred. In cases this is the only available MAC address, this leaves
Netty using a random machine ID instead of using a perfectly valid
machine ID from the locally-adminstered address.

Modifications:

This commit modifies the MAC address logic so that the empty MAC address
is not preferred over a locally-administered address. This commit also
simplifies the comparison logic here.

Result:

Empty MAC addresses will not be preferred over locally-administered
addresses thus permitting the default machine ID to be the
locally-adminstered MAC address if it is the only available MAC address.
