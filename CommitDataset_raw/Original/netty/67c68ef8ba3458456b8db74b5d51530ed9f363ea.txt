CorsHandler should release HttpRequest after processing preflight/error.

Motivation:
Currently, when the CorsHandler processes a preflight request, or
respondes with an 403 Forbidden using the short-curcuit option, the
HttpRequest is not released which leads to a buffer leak.

Modifications:
Releasing the HttpRequest when done processing a preflight request or
responding with an 403.

Result:
Using the CorsHandler will not cause buffer leaks.
