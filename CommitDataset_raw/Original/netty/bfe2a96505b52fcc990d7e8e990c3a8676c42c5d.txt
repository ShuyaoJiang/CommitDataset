Fix AssertionError from AsyncSocketChannel.beginRead()

An AssertionError is triggered by a ByteBuf when beginRead() attempts to
access the buffer which has been freed already.  This commit ensures the
buffer is not freed before performing an I/O operation.

To determine if the buffer has been freed, UnsafeByteBuf.isFreed() has
been added.
