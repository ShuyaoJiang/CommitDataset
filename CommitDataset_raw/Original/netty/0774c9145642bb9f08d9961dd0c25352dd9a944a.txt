Support the little endian floats and doubles by ByteBuf

Motivation:
`ByteBuf` does not have the little endian variant of float/double access methods.

Modifications:
Add support for little endian floats and doubles into `ByteBuf`.

Result:
`ByteBuf` has get/read/set/writeFloatLE() and get/read/set/writeDoubleLE() methods. Fixes [#6576].
