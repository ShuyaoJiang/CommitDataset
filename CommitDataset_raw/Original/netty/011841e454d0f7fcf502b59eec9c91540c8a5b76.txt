ReadOnlyUnsafeDirectByteBuf.memoryAddress() should not throw

Motivation:

We need the memoryAddress of a direct buffer when using our native transports. For this reason ReadOnlyUnsafeDirectByteBuf.memoryAddress() should not throw.

Modifications:

- Correctly override ReadOnlyUnsafeDirectByteBuf.memoryAddress() and hasMemoryAddress()
- Add test case

Result:

Fixes [#7672].
