Fix incorrectly encoded empty SOCKS5 address (#8292)

Motivation:

If you encode a SOCKS5 message like new DefaultSocks5CommandResponse(FAILURE, DOMAIN, "", 0)
you correctly get a result of 05010003000000.
But if the bndAddr is null, for example like new DefaultSocks5CommandResponse(FAILURE, DOMAIN)
the encoded result is 0501000301000000 which means the domain name has a length of one and consists of a 0-byte.

Modification:

With this commit it is also correctly encoded as a string of 0 length.

Result:

Correctly encode empty SOCKS5 address
