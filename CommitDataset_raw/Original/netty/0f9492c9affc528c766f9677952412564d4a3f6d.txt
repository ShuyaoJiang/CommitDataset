Add first-class Little Endian support to ByteBuf and descendants

As discussed in	#3209, this PR adds Little Endian accessors
to ByteBuf and descendants.

Corresponding accessors were added to UnsafeByteBufUtil,
HeapByteBufferUtil to avoid calling `reverseBytes`.

Deprecate `order()`, `order(buf)` and `SwappedByteBuf`.
