EpollDatagramChannel avoid getOption

Motivation:
EpollDatagramChannel uses getOption in the isActive method. getOption is backed by a relatively large conditional if/else if block and this conditional checking can be avoided in the epoll transport.

Modifications:
- Add EpollDatagramChannelConfig#getActiveOnOpen and use this in EpollDatagramChannel

Result:
Conditional checking due to getOption is removed from EpollDatagramChannel.
