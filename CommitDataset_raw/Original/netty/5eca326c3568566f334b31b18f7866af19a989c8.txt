Do not treat errors as decoder exception

Motivation: Today when Netty encounters a general error while decoding
it treats this as a decoder exception. However, for fatal causes this
should not be treated as such, instead the fatal error should be carried
up the stack without the callee having to unwind causes.

Modifications: Instead of translating any error to a decoder exception,
we let those unwind out the stack (note that finally blocks still
execute).

Result: Fatal errors will not be treated as innocent decoder exceptions.
