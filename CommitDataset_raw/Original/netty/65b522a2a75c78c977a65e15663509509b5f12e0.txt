Better buffer leak reporting

- Remove the reference to ResourceLeak from the buffer implementations
  and use wrappers instead:
  - SimpleLeakAwareByteBuf and AdvancedLeakAwareByteBuf
  - It is now allocator's responsibility to create a leak-aware buffer.
  - Added AbstractByteBufAllocator.toLeakAwareBuffer() for easier
    implementation
- Add WrappedByteBuf to reduce duplication between *LeakAwareByteBuf and
  UnreleasableByteBuf
- Raise the level of leak reports to ERROR - because it will break the
  app eventually
- Replace enabled/disabled property with the leak detection level
  - Only print stack trace when level is ADVANCED or above to avoid user
    confusion
- Add the 'leak' build profile, which enables highly detailed leak
  reporting during the build
- Remove ResourceLeakException which is unsed anymore
