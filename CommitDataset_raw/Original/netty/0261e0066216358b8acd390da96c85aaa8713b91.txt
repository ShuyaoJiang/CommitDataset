Allow to call AbstractDiskHttpData.setContent(Unpooled.EMPTY_BUFFER) multiple times. (#7890)

Motivation:

It should be possible to call setContent(Unpooled.EMPTY_BUFFER) multiple times just like its possible to do the same with a non empty buffer.

Modifications:

- Correctly reset underlying storage if called multiple times.
- Add tests

Result:

Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/6418
