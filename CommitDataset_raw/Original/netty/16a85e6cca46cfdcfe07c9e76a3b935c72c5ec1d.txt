[#2307] Remove synchronized bottleneck in SingleThreadEventExecutor.execute(...)

Motivation:
Remove the synchronization bottleneck in startThread() which is called by each execute(..) call from outside the EventLoop.

Replace the synchronized block with the use of AtomicInteger and compareAndSet loops.

Result:
Less conditions during SingleThreadEventExecutor.execute(...)
