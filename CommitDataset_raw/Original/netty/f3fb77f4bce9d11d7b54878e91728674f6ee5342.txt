Have microbenchmarks produce a deployable artifact. Fix some minor miscellaneous issues.

Motivation:
Allows for running benchmarks from built jars which is useful in development environments that only take released artifacts.

Modifications:
Move benchmarks into 'main' from 'test'
Add @State annotations to benchmarks that are missing them
Fix timing issue grabbing context during channel initialization

Result:
Users can run benchmarks more easily.
