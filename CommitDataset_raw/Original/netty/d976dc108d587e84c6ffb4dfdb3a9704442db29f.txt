codec-http2: Improve h1 to h2 header conversion

Motivation:

Netty could handle "connection" or "te" headers more gently when
converting from http/1.1 to http/2 headers.  Http/2 headers don't
support single-hop headers, so when we convert from http/1.1 to http/2,
we should drop all single-hop headers.  This includes headers like
"transfer-encoding" and "connection", but also the headers that
"connection" points to, since "connection" can be used to designate
other headers as single-hop headers.  For the "te" header, we can more
permissively convert it by just dropping non-conforming headers (ie
non-"trailers" headers) which is what we do for all other headers when
we convert.

Modifications:

Add a new blacklist to the http/1.1 to http/2 conversion, which is
constructed from the values of the "connection" header, and stop
throwing an exception when a "te" header is passed with a non-"trailers"
value.  Instead, drop all values except for "trailers".  Add unit tests
for "connection" and "te" headers when converting from http/1.1 to http/2.

Result:

This will improve the h2c upgrade request, and also conversions from
http/1.1 to http/2.  This will simplify implementing spec-compliant
http/2 servers that want to share code between their http/1.1 and http/2
implementations.

[Fixes #7355]
