Add explicit message when `noexec` prevents library loading.

Motivation:

Docker's `--tmpfs` flag mounts the temp volume with `noexec` by default,
resulting in an UnsatisfiedLinkError.  While this is good security
practice, it is a surprising failure from a seemingly innocuous flag.

Modifications:

Add a best-effort attempt in `NativeLibraryLoader` to detect when temp
files beng loaded cannot be executed even when execution permissions
are set, often because the `noexec` flag is set on the volume.

Requires numerous additional exclusions to the Animal Sniffer config
for Java7 POSIX permissions manipulation.

Result:

Fixes [#6678].
