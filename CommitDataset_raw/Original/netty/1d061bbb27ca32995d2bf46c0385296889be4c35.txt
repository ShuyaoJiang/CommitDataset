Hide password in exception messages of SocksAuthRequest

Related: #3504

Motivation:

There are two places in the SocksAuthRequest constructor where an
IllegalArgumentException is thrown with a password as part of the
exception message.

This constitutes mishandling of confidential information, which can
compromise user privacy and is flagged as critical by security scanners.

Modifications:

Mask the password in the exception messages

Result:

No unexpected password leak
