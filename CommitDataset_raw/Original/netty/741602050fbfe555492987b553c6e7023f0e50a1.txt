Don't replace all 'connection' headers when sending h2c upgrade request (#7824)

Motivation:

There may be meaningful 'connection' headers that exist on a request
that is used to attempt a HTTP/1.x upgrade request that will be
clobbered.

Modifications:

HttpClientUpgradeHandler uses the `HttpHeaders.add` instead of
`HttpHeaders.set` when adding the 'upgrade' field.

Result:

Fixes #7823, existing 'connection' headers are preserved.
