Unpooled and Wrapped Buffer Leak

Motivation:
There are a few buffer leaks related to how Unpooled.wrapped and Base64.encode is used.

Modifications:
- Fix usages of Bas64.encode to correct leaks
- Clarify interface of Unpooled.wrapped* to ensure reference count ownership is clearly defined.

Result:
Reference count code is more clearly defined and less leaks are possible.
