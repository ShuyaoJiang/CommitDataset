More precise calculate the maximum record size when using SslProvider.OPENSSL* and so decrease mem usage.

Motivation:

We used ca 2k as maximum overhead for encrypted packets which is a lot more then what is needed in reality by OpenSSL. This could lead to the need of more memory.

Modification:

- Use a lower overhead of 86 bytes as defined by the spec and openssl itself
- Fix unit test to use the correct session to calculate needed buffer size

Result:

Less memory usage.
