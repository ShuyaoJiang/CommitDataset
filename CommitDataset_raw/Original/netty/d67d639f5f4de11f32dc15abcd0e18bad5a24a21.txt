Add integration test for shading native libraries. (#8123)

Motivation:

It's easy to break the support for shading native libs as shown in https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/8090. We should have some testing to ensure all works as expected.

Modification:

Add new testsuite which verifies that shading our native transports work as expected.

Result:

Include test to verify shading of native code.
