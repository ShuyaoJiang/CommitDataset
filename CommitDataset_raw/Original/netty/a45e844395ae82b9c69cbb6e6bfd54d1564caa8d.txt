HttpResponseStatus reasonPhrase equals usage

Motivation:
HttpResponseStatus.reasonPhrase returns an AsciiString, but was compared using equals to a String. Other usages of the reasonPhrase also use the toString() method when not necessary.

Modifications:
- Use the contentEquals method

Result:
Correct comparison, and no toString() when not needed.
