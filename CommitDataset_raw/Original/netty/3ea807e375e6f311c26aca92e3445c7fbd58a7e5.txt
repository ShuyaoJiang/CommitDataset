Flush LZ4FrameEncoder buffer when channel flush() is received.

Motivation:

LZ4FrameEncoder maintains an internal buffer of incoming data compress, and only writes out compressed data when a size threshold is reached. LZ4FrameEncoder does not override the flush() method, and thus the only way to flush data down the pipeline is via more data or close the channel.

Modifications:

Override the flush() function to flush on demand. Also overrode the allocateBuffer() function so we can more accurately size the output buffer (instead of needing to potatntially realloc via buffer.ensureWritable()).

Result:

Implementation works as described.
