Buffer Leaks in Compression Tests

Motivation:
The unit tests for the compression encoders/decoders may write buffers to an EmbeddedChannel but then may not release buffer or close the channel after the test. This may result in buffer leaks.

Modifications:
- Call channel.finishAndReleaseAll() after each test

Result:
Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/6007
