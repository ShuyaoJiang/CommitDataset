SSLSession.putValue / getValue / removeValue / getValueNames must be thread-safe. (#8648)

Motivation:

SSLSession.putValue / getValue / removeValue / getValueNames must be thread-safe as it may be called from multiple threads. This is also the case in the OpenJDK implementation.

Modifications:

Guard with synchronized (this) blocks to keep the memory overhead low as we do not expect to have these called frequently.

Result:

SSLSession implementation is thread-safe.
