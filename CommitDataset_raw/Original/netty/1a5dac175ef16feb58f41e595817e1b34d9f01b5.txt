Correctly register for EPOLLRDHUP when construct EpollSocketChannel from FileDescriptor

Motivation:

We missed to register for EPOLLRDHUP events when construct the EpollSocketChannel from an existing FileDescriptor. This could cause to miss connection-resets.

Modifications:

Add Native.EPOLLRDHUP to the events we are interested in.

Result:

Connection-resets are detected correctly.
