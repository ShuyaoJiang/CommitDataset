Correctly test for non-auto-read correctness in testsuite

Motiviation:

Our tests for non-auto-read did actually not test this correctly as auto-read was never disabled on the Bootstrap and ServerBootstrap.

Modifications:

- Correctly disable auto-read on Bootstrap and ServerBootstrap
- Fix tests to call ChannelHandlerContext.read() once a Channel becomes active.

Result:

Correctly test that non-auto-read works.
