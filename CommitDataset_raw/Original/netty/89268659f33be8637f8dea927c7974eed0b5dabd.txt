[#4836] Enforce 64bit JDK when build netty.

Motivation:

As we only provide tcnative jars for 64bit we should enforce 64bit when try to build netty, to make it easier for the user to understand why the build fails.

Modifications:

Add enforce rule.

Result:

Ensure 64bit is used when build netty.
