ByteString arrayOffset method

Motivation:
The ByteString class currently assumes the underlying array will be a complete representation of data. This is limiting as it does not allow a subsection of another array to be used. The forces copy operations to take place to compensate for the lack of API support.

Modifications:
- add arrayOffset method to ByteString
- modify all ByteString and AsciiString methods that loop over or index into the underlying array to use this offset
- update all code that uses ByteString.array to ensure it accounts for the offset
- add unit tests to test the implementation respects the offset

Result:
ByteString and AsciiString can represent a sub region of a byte[].
