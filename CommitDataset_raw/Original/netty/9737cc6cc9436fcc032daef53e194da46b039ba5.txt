Include error code and message in GOAWAY events.

Motivation:

The Connection.Listener GOAWAY event handler currently provides no additional information, requiring applications to hack in other ways to get at the error code and debug message.

Modifications:

Modified the Connection.Listener interface to pass on the error code and message that triggered the GOAWAY.

Result:

Application can now use Connection.Listener for all GOAWAY processing.
