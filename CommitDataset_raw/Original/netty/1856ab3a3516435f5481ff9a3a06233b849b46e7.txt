Make DnsNameResolverTest.testQueryMx() more robust

Motivation:

DNS servers seem to reply with ServFail(2) response code when it is
busy.

Modifications:

- Retry when response code is ServFail instead of failing the test
- Try all DNS servers instead of retrying twice only

Result:

testQueryMx() is less likely to fail due to public DNS server problems
