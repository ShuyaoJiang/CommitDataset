[#5566] Ensure using a ChannelInitializer via ServerBootstrap.handler(...) produce correct ordering.

Motivation:

When a ChannelInitializer is used via ServerBootstrap.handler(...) the users handlers may be added after the internal ServerBootstrapAcceptor. This should not happen.

Modifications:

Delay the adding of the ServerBootstrapAcceptor until the initChannel(....) method returns.

Result:

Correct order of handlers in the ServerChannels ChannelPipeline.
