Add dependency management for missing entries

Motivation:

The bom does not provide entries for a number of netty modules, in
particular those that are deployed with classifiers. As a result, they
can't be used without defining a version.

Modifications:

Provide dependency management for the missing modules.

Result:

Fixes [#6852]
