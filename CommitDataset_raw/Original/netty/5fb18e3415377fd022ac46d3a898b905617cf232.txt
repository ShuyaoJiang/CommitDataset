InboundHttp2ToHttpAdapter leak and logic improvements

Motivation:
In HttpConversionUtil's toHttpRequest and toHttpResponse methods can
allocate FullHttpMessage objects, and if an exeception is thrown during
the header conversion then this object will not be released. If a
FullHttpMessage is not fired up the pipeline, and the stream is closed
then we remove from the map, but do not release the object. This leads
to a ByteBuf leak. Some of the logic related to stream lifetime management
and FullHttpMessage also predates the RFC being finalized and is not correct.

Modifications:
- Fix leaks in HttpConversionUtil
- Ensure the objects are released when they are removed from the map.
- Correct logic and unit tests where they are found to be incorrect.

Result:
Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/4780
Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/3619
