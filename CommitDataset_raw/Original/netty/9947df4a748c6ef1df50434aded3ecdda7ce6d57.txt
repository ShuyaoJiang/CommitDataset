Add test for correctly handling SSLSessionBindingEvent when acting on thâ€¦ (#8649)


Motivation:

During some other work I noticed we do not have any tests to ensure we correctly use SSLSessionBindingEvent. We should add some testing.

Modifications:

- Added unit test to verify we correctly implement it.
- Ignore the test when using Conscrypt as it not correctly implements it.

Result:

More tests for custom SSL impl.
