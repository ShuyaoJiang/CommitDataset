Recycler will produce npe error when multiple recycled at different thread

Motivation:

Recycler may produce a NPE when the same object is recycled multiple times from different threads.

Modifications:

- Check if the id has changed or if the Stack became null and if so throw an IllegalStateException
- Add unit test

Result:

Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/8220.
