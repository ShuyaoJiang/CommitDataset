Fix timestamp parsing in HttpHeaderDateFormatter

Motivation:
code assumes a numeric value of 0 means no digits were read between separators, which fails for timestamps like 00:00:00.
also code accepts invalid timestamps like 0:0:000

Modifications:
explicitly check for number of digits between separators instead of relying on the numeric value.
also add tests.

Result:
timestamps with 00 successfully parse, timestamps with 000 no longer
