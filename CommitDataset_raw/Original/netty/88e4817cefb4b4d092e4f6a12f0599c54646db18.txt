Include correct dependencies for testsuite-shading on windows. (#8491)

Motivation:

We missed to include a profile for windows which means that we did not have the correct dependencies setup.

Modifications:

- Add missing profile
- Add assumeFalse(...) to ensure we do only test the native transpot shading on non windows platforms.
- Explicit specify dependency on netty-common

Result:

Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/8489.
