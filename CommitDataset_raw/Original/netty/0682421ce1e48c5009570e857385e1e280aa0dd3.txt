Remove unused classes

- ChannelPipelineFactory will be replaced with sometime else when I
  refactory the bootstrap package
- FileRegion is going away.  A user can deregister a channel and perform
  such operations by him/herself.  If this turns out to be too
  difficult, I'll introduce a new 'sendfile' operation to the outbound
  handler.
