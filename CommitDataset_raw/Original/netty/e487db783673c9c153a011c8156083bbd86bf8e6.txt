Use the ByteBufAllocator when copy a ReadOnlyByteBufferBuf and so also be able to release it without the GC when the Cleaner is present.

Motivation:

In ReadOnlyByteBufferBuf.copy(...) we just allocated a ByteBuffer directly and wrapped it. This way it was not possible for us to free the direct memory that was used by the copy without the GC.

Modifications:

- Ensure we use the allocator when create the copy and so be able to release direct memory in a timely manner
- Add unit test
- Depending on if the to be copied buffer is direct or heap based we also allocate the same type on copy.

Result:

Fixes [#7103].
