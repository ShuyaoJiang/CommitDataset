Change client id validation range in codec-mqtt

Motivation:

In MQTT 3.1 specification, "The Client Identifier (Client ID) is between
1 and 23 characters long, and uniquely identifies the client to the
server". But, current client id validation length is 0~23. It must be
1~23. The empty string is invalid client id in MQTT 3.1

Modifications:

Change isValidClientId method. Add MIN_CLIENT_ID_LENGTH.

Result:

The validation check for client id length is between 1 and 23.
