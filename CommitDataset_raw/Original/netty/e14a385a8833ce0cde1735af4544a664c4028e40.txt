Add support for SNIHostName when using Java8+

Motivation:

Java8 added support for using SNIHostName with SSLParameters. We currently ignore it in OpenSslEngine.

Modifications:

Use reflection to support SNIHostName.

Result:

People using Java8 can use SNIHostName even when OpenSslEngine is used.
