Implement toString() for all HttpMessage implementations

Related: #3019

Motivation:

We have multiple (Full)HttpRequest/Response implementations and only
some of them implements toString() properly.

Modifications:

- Add the reusable string converter for HttpMessages to HttpMessageUtil
- Implement toString() of (Full)HttpRequest/Response implementations
  properly using HttpMessageUtil

Result:

Prettier string representation is returned by HttpMessage
implementations.
