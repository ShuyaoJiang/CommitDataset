Allow to disable only heap or direct buffer pool

- Fixes #1315

If a user specifies the arena size of 0, the pool is now disabled
instead of raising an IllegalArgumentException. Using this, you can
disable only heap or direct buffer pool easily. Once disabled,
PooledByteBufAllocator will delegate the allocation request to
UnpooledByteBufAllocator.
