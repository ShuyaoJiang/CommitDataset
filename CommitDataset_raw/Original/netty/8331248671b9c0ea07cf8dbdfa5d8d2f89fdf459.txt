ChannelInitializer may be invoked multiple times when used with custom EventExecutor. (#8620)

Motivation:

The ChannelInitializer may be invoked multipled times when used with a custom EventExecutor as removal operation may be done asynchronously. We need to guard against this.

Modifications:

- Change Map to Set which is more correct in terms of how we use it.
- Ensure we only modify the internal Set when the handler was removed yet
- Add unit test.

Result:

Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/8616.
