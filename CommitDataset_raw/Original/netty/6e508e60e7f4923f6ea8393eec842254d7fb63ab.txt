Move generic unix classes/interfaces out of epoll package

Motivation:

As we plan to have other native transports soon (like a kqueue transport) we should move unix classes/interfaces out of the epoll package so we
introduce other implementations without breaking stuff before the next stable release.

Modifications:

Create a new io.netty.channel.unix package and move stuff over there.

Result:

Possible to introduce other native impls beside epoll.
