Remove id from DnsQueryContextManager whenever the promise is fullfilled.

Motivation:

We did not handle the case when the query was cancelled which could lead to an exhausted id space. Beside this we did not not cancel the timeout on failed promises.

Modifications:

- Do the removal of the id from the manager in a FutureListener so its handled in all cases.
- Cancel the timeout whenever the original promise was full-filled.

Result:

Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/8013.
