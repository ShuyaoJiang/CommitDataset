Rename the old LinkedTransferQueue to LegacyLinkedTransferQueue and fork
the "current" implementation of LinkedTransferQueue (from Doug Lea).
Introduce a QueueFactory which will load the right implementation
depending on the JVM version. This will make sure that the one with the
best performance is choosen and the code also works with java 5. See
