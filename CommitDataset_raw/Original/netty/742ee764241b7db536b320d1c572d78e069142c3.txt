RedisDecoder infinite loop

Motivation:
RedisDecoder can get into an infinite loop while decoding bulk strings if the final \r and \n to indicate the end of content are split on ByteBuf boundaries.

Modifications:
- We should break out of the decode loop if remainingBulkLength is 0 and we don't have enough data to read EOL

Result:
No more infinite loop in RedisDecoder#decodeBulkStringContent.
