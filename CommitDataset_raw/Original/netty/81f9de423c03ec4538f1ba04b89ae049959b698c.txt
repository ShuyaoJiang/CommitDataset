HostsFileParser should allow both IPv4 and IPv6 for a given host

Motivation:

HostsFileParser only retains the first address for each given hostname.
This is wrong, and itâ€™s allowed to have both an IPv4 and an IPv6.

Modifications:

* Have `HostsFileParser` now return a `HostsFileEntries` that contains IPv4 entries and IPv6 entries
* Introduce `ResolvedAddressTypes` to describe resolved address types preferences
* Add a new `ResolvedAddressTypes` parameter to `HostsFileEntriesResolver::address` to account for address types preferences
* Change `DnsNameResolver` constructor to take a `ResolvedAddressTypes`, allowing for a null value that would use default
* Change `DnsNameResolverBuilder::resolvedAddressTypes` to take a `ResolvedAddressTypes`
* Make `DnsNameResolver::resolvedAddressTypes` return a `ResolvedAddressTypes`
* Add a static `DnsNameResolverBuilder::computeResolvedAddressTypes` to ease converting from `InternetProtocolFamily`

Result:

We now support hosts files that contains IPv4 and IPv6 pairs for a same
hostname.
