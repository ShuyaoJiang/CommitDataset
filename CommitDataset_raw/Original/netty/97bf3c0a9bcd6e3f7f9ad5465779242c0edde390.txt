Correctly throw IndexOutOfBoundsException when dst.remaining() is too big.

Motivation:

In some ByteBuf implementations we not correctly implement getBytes(index, ByteBuffer).

Modifications:

Correct code to do what is defined in the javadocs and adding test.

Result:

Implementation works as described.
