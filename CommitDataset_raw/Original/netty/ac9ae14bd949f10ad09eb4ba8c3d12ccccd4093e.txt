HTTP/2 SimpleChannelPromiseAggregator failure condition

Motivation:
If a SimpleChannelPromiseAggregator is failed before any new promises are generated, the failure is not propegated through to the aggregated promise.

Modifications:
- Failures should be allowed to occur even if no new promises have been generated

Result:
Failures are always allowed.
