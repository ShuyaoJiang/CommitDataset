HTTP/2 Connection Listener Unchecked Exceptions

Motivation:
The DefaultHttp2Connection is not checking for RuntimeExceptions when invoking Http2Connection.Listener methods. This is a problem for a few reasons: 1. The state of DefaultHttp2Connection will be corrupted if a listener throws a RuntimeException. 2. If the first listener throws then no other listeners will be notified, which may further corrupt state that is updated as a result of listeners being notified.

Modifications:
- Document that RuntimeExceptions are not supported for Http2Connection.Listener methods, and will be logged as an error.
- Update DefaultHttp2Connection to handle and exception for each listener that is notified, and be sure that 1 listener throwing an exception does not prevent others from being notified.

Result:
More robust DefaultHttp2Connection.
