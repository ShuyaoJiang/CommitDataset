Make JsonObjectDecoder discard everything after stream corruption

Motivation:

There's no way to recover from a corrupted JSON stream. The current
implementation will raise an infinite exception storm when a peer sends
a large corrupted stream.

Modification:

Discard everything once stream corruption is detected.

Result:

Fixes a buffer leak
Fixes exception storm
