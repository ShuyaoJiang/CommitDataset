Fix buffer leak in DefaultFullBinaryMemcacheRequest/Response

Motivation:

DefaultFullBinaryMemcacheRequest/Response overrides release(), retain(),
and touch() methods without calling its super, resulting in a leak of
the extras.

Modifications:

When overriding release(), retain(), and touch(), ensure to call super.

Result:

Fixes #2533 by fixing the buffer leak
