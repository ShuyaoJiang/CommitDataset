Avoid implicit allocations in Http2FrameLogger when logging is disabled (#7937)

Motivation:

Integer autoboxing in this class (and possibly also the varargs arrays)
showed non-negligible CPU and garbage contribution when profiling a gRPC
service. grpc-java currently hardcodes use of Http2FrameLogger, set at
DEBUG level.

Modifications:

Wrap offending log statements in conditional blocks.

Result:

Garbage won't be produced by Http2FrameLogger when set to a disabled
logging level.
