Load Conscrypt method via reflection only once

Motivation:

The code did reflection every method call which made the code slower and
harder to read with additional cases to consider.

Modifications:

Instead of loading the method and then throwing it away, save the Method
reference instead of the Class reference. Then also use more precise
exception handling for the method invocation.

Result:

Simpler, speedier code.
