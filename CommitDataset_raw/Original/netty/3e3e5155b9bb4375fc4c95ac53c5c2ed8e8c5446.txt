Check if Log level is enabled before creating log statements (#8022)

Motivation

There is a cost to concatenating strings and calling methods that will be wasted if the Logger's level is not enabled.

Modifications

Check if Log level is enabled before producing log statement. These are just a few cases found by RegEx'ing in the code.

Result

Tiny bit more efficient code.
