Use ByteBuf.readSlice(...).retain() to minimize memory copies.

Motivation:
At the moment we call ByteBuf.readBytes(...) in these handlers but with optimizations done as part of 25e0d9d we can just use readSlice(...).retain() and eliminate the memory copy.

Modifications:
Replace ByteBuf.readBytes(...) usage with readSlice(...).retain().

Result:
Less memory copies.
