Workaround IBM's J9 JVM getSupportedCipherSuites() returning SSL_ prefix cipher names

Motivation:
IBM's J9 JVM utilizes a custom cipher naming scheme with SSL_ prefix [1] instead of the TLS_ prefix defined by TLS RFCs and the JSSE cihper suite names [2]. IBM's documentation says that the SSL_ prefix are "interchangeable" with cipher names with the TLS_ prefix [1]. To work around this issue we parse the supported cipher list and see an SSL_ prefix we can also add the same cipher with the TLS_ prefix. For more details see a discussion on IBM's forums [3] and IBM's issue tracker [4].

Modifications:
- When parsing the supported cipher list to get the supported ciphers and we encounter a SSL_ prefix we should also add a TLS_ prefix cipher.
- Remove SSL_ prefix ciphers from Http2SecurityUtil.

Result:
Work around for IBM JVM's custom naming scheme covers more cases for supported cipher suites.
