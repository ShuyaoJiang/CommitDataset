Preserve the host name of address when parsing /etc/hosts file

Motivation:

When an InetNameResolver resolves a name, it is expected to reserve the
requested host name in the resolved InetAddress.

DefaultHostsFileEntriesResolver does not preserve the host name. For
example, resolving 'localhost' will return an InetAddress whose address
is '127.0.0.1', but its getHostString() will not return 'localhost' but
just '127.0.0.1'.

Modifications:

Fix the construction of parsed InetAddresses in HostsFileParser

Result:

Host name is preserved in the resolved InetAddress
