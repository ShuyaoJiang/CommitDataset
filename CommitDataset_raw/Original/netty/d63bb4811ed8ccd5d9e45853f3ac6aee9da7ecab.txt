Only call ctx.fireChannelReadComplete() if ByteToMessageDecoder decoded at least one message.

Motivation:

Its wasteful and also confusing that channelReadComplete() is called even if there was no message forwarded to the next handler.

Modifications:

- Only call ctx.fireChannelReadComplete() if at least one message was decoded
- Add unit test

Result:

Less confusing behavior. Fixes [#4312].
