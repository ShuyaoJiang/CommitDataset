Allow to disable caching in PooledByteBufAllocator for non FastThreadLocalThreads

Motivation:

If a user allocates a lot from outside the EventLoop we may end up creating a lot of caches in the PooledByteBufAllocator. This may be wasteful and so it may be useful for an other to configure that caches should only be used from within EventLoops.

Modifications:

Add new constructor which allows to configure the caching behaviour.

Result:

More flexible configuration of PooledByteBufAllocator possible
