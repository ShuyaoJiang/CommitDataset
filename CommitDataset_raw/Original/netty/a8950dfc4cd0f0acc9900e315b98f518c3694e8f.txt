InternalThreadLocalMap.arrayList should create a reusable ArrayList only if arrayList field is NULL.

Motivation:

InternalThreadLocalMap.arrayList returns a new ArrayList every time it's called that defeats the purpose of having a reusable ArrayList.

Modification:

Modified InternalThreadLocalMap.arrayList to create an ArrayList only if arrayList field is NULL.

Result:

InternalThreadLocalMap.arrayList now creates a reusable ArrayList only if arrayList field is NULL.
