PlatformDependent ASCII hash code broken on big endian machines

Motivation:
PlatformDependent has a hash code algorithm which utilizes UNSAFE for performance reasons. This hash code algorithm must also be consistent with CharSequence objects that represent a collection of ASCII characters. In order to make the UNSAFE versions and CharSequence versions the endianness should be taken into account. However the big endian code was not correct in a few places.

Modifications:
- Correct bugs in PlatformDependent class related to big endian ASCII hash code computation

Result:
Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/5925
