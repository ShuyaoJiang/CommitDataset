Add support for byte order to LengthFieldPrepender

Motivation:

While the LengthFieldBasedFrameDecoder supports a byte order the LengthFieldPrepender does not.
That means that I can simply add a LengthFieldBasedFrameDecoder with ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN to my pipeline
but have to write my own Encoder to write length fields in little endian byte order.

Modifications:

Added a constructor that takes a byte order and all other parameters.
All other constructors delegate to this one with ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN.
LengthFieldPrepender.encode() uses this byte order to write the length field.

Result:

LengthFieldPrepender will write the length field in the defined byte order.
