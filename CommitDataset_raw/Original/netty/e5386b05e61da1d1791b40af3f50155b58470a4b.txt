Move Hex dump related util from ByteBufUtil to inner class

Motivation:

Initialisation of the ByteBufUtil class, a class frequently used is
delayed because a significant number of String operations is performed to
fill a HEXDUMP_ROWPREFIXES array. This array also sticks to the Strings
forever.
It is quite likely that applications never use the hexdump facility.

Modification:

Moved the static initialisation and references to a static inner class.
This delays initialisation (and memory usage) until actually needed.
The API is kept as is.

Result:

Faster startup time, less memory usage for most netty using applications.
