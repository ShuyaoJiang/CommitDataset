ByteToMessageDecoder#handlerRemoved may release cumulation buffer prematurely

Motivation:
ByteToMessageDecoder#handlerRemoved will immediately release the cumulation buffer, but it is possible that a child class may still be using this buffer, and therefore use a dereferenced buffer.

Modifications:
- ByteToMessageDecoder#handlerRemoved and ByteToMessageDecoder#decode should coordinate to avoid the case where a child class is using the cumulation buffer but ByteToMessageDecoder releases that buffer.

Result:
Child classes of ByteToMessageDecoder are less likely to reference a released buffer.
