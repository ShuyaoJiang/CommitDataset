Adding explicit comment about case statement

Motivation:

When compiling this code and running it through errorprone[1], this message appears:
```
StringUtil.java:493: error: [FallThrough] Switch case may fall through; add a `// fall through` comment if it was deliberate
                    case LINE_FEED:
                    ^
    (see http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/FallThrough)
```
By adding that comment, it silences the error and also makes clear the intention of that statement.

Modification:

Add simple comment.

Result:

Errorprone is happier with the code.
