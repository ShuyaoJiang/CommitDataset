Update links from code.google.com to github.com

Motivation:

This pull request does not solve any problem but we find that several links in the code refer to project websites under the domain of http://code.google.com which are either moved to github or not maintained anymore.

Modification:

Update the project links from code.google.com to the relevant project in github.com
