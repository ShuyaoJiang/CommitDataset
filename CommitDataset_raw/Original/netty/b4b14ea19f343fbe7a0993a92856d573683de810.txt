Ensure backward-compability with 4.0

Motivation:

Each different *ChannelOption did extend ChannelOption in 4.0, which we changed in 4.1. This is a breaking change in terms of the API so we need to ensure we keep the old hierarchy.

Modifications:

- Let all *ChannelOption extend ChannelOption
- Add back constructor and mark it as @deprecated

Result:

No API breakage between 4.0 and 4.1
