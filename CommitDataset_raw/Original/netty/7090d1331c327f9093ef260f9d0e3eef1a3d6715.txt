Clear disabled SSL protocols before enabling provided SSL protocols

Motivation:

Attempts to enable SSL protocols which are currently disabled fail when using the OpenSslEngine. Related to https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/4736

Modifications:

Clear out all options that have disabled SSL protocols before attempting to enable any SSL protocol.

Result:

setEnabledProtocols works as expected.
