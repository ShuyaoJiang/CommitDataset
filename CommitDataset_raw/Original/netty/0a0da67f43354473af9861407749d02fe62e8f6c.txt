Introduce SingleThreadEventLoop.registeredChannels (#8428)

Motivation:

Systems depending on Netty may benefit (telemetry, alternative even loop scheduling algorithms) from knowing the number of channels assigned to each EventLoop.

Modification:

Expose the number of channels registered in the EventLoop via SingleThreadEventLoop.registeredChannels.

Result:

Fixes #8276.
