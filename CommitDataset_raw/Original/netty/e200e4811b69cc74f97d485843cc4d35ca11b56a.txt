SocketRstTest fails due to exception message check

Motivation:
For lack of a better way the SocketRstTest inspects the content of the exception message to check if a RST occurred. However on windows the exception message is different than on other Unix based platforms and the assertion statement fails.

Modifications:
- Hack another string check in the unit test

Result:
SocketRstTest passes on windows
