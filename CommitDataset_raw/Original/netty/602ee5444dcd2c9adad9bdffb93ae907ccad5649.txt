NetUtil valid IP methods to accept CharSequence (#7827)

* NetUtil valid IP methods to accept CharSequence

Motivation:
NetUtil has methods to determine if a String is a valid IP address. These methods don't rely upon String specific methods and can use CharSequence instead.

Modifications:
- Use CharSequence instead of String for the IP validator methods.
- Avoid object allocation in AsciiString#indexOf(char,int) and reduce
byte code

Result:
No more copy operation required if a CharSequence exists.
