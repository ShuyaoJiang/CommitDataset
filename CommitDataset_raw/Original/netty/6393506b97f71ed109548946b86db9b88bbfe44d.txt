Extract SocketAdress logic from NameResolver

Motivation:

As discussed in #4529, NameResolver design shouldn't be resolving SocketAddresses (or String name + port) and return InetSocketAddresses. It should resolve String names and return InetAddresses.
This SocketAddress to InetSocketAddresses resolution is actually a different concern, used by Bootstrap.

Modifications:

Extract SocketAddress to InetSocketAddresses resolution concern to a new class hierarchy named AddressResolver.
These AddressResolvers delegate to NameResolvers.

Result:

Better separation of concerns.

Note that new AddressResolvers generate a bit more allocations because of the intermediate Promise and List<InetAddress>.
