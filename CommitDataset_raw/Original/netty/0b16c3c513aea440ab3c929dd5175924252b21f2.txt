Add a possibility to create HttpMessage instances with pre-existing Headers

Motivation:

Allow passing HttpHeaders instance to DefaultHttpMessage
in order to avoid eager creation of Headers to
allow users reuse their Headers instance.

Modifications:

Added a constructor with HttpHeaders to DefaultHttpMessage,
Modified DefaultHttpResponse and DefaultHttpRequest
to receive HttpHeaders instances.
Modified DefaultFullHttpReqest and DefaultFullHttpResponse
to receive HttpHeaders, and updated `duplicate` and
`copy` to use new constructors.

Result:

Users can now pass HttpHeaders instance when
constructing Http Requests and Responses.
