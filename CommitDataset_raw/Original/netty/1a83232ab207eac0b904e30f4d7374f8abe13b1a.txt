[#3463] EpollSocketChannel.localAddress() returns always null if Native.connect() was not able to connect directly

Motivation:

Due a a regression that was introduced by b898bdd we failed to set the localAddress if the connect did not success directly.

Modifications:

Correct set localAddress in doConnect(...)

Result:

Be able to get the localAddress in all cases.
