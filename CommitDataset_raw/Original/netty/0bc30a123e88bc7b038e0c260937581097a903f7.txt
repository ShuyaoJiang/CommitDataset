Eliminate usage of releaseLater(...) to reduce memory usage during tests

Motiviation:

We used ReferenceCountUtil.releaseLater(...) in our tests which simplifies a bit the releasing of ReferenceCounted objects. The problem with this is that while it simplifies stuff it increase memory usage a lot as memory may not be freed up in a timely manner.

Modifications:

- Deprecate releaseLater(...)
- Remove usage of releaseLater(...) in tests.

Result:

Less memory needed to build netty while running the tests.
