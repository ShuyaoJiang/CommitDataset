DefaultHttp2Headers should throw exception of type Http2Exception

Motivation:
The DefaultHttp2Headers code is throwing a IllegalArgumentException if an invalid character is detected. This is being ignored by the HTTP/2 codec instead of generating a GOAWAY.

Modifications:
- Throw a Http2Exception of type PROTOCOL_ERROR in accordance with https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-8.1.2.6
- Update examples which were building invalid headers

Result:
More compliant with https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-8.1.2.6
