Replace infinite Iterable/Iterator with dedicated types

Related: #4065

Motivation:

DnsNameResolver was using a special Iterable/Iterator implementation
that yields an infinite stream of DNS server addresses. However, this
seems to cause confusion.

Modifications:

- Make DnsServerAddresses an abstract class with an abstract stream()
  method that returns DnsServerAddressStream
- Add DnsServerAddressStream that yields DNS server address infinitely
- Remove DnsServerResolver(Group) constructors that accept only a single
  server address, which wasn't very useful in practice
- Extract the DnsServerAddresses implementations to top level
- DnsServerAddresses.defaultAddresses() now returns DnsServerAddresses.
  - Add DnsServerAddresses.defaultAddressList() instead

Result:

Less confusion and more explicitness
