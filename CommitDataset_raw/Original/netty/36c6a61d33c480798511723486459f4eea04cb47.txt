HTTP/2 remove unnecessary buffer operations

Motivation:
codec-http2 has some helper methods to write to ByteBuf in a big endian fashion. This is the default memory structure for ByteBuf so these helper methods are not necessary.

Modifications:
- remove writeUnsignedInt and writeUnsignedShort

Result:
codec-http2 has less ByteBuf helper methods which are not necessary.
