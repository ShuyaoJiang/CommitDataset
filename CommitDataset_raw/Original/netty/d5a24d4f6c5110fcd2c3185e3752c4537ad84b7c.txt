Make SslHandler work when autoRead is turned off

Related: #2958

Motivation:

SslHandler currently does not issue a read() request when it is
handshaking. It makes a connection with autoRead off stall, because a
user's read() request can be used to read the handshake response which
is invisible to the user.

Modifications:

- SslHandler now issues a read() request when:
  - the current handshake is in progress and channelReadComplete() is
    invoked
  - the current handshake is complete and a user issued a read() request
    during handshake
- Rename flushedBeforeHandshakeDone to flushedBeforeHandshake for
  consistency with the new variable 'readDuringHandshake'

Result:

SslHandler should work regardless whether autoRead is on or off.
