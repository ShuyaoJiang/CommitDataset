Run all tests in SSLEngineTest with heap, direct and mixed buffers

Motivation:

As we use different execution path in our SSLEngine implementation depending on if heap, direct or mixed buffers are used we should run the tests with all of them.

Modification:

Ensure we run all tests with different buffer types.

Result:

Better test-coverage
