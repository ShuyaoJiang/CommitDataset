Fail build when Illegal reflective access is detected (#8933)

Motivation:

We want to make the experience as smooth as possible for our users when using Java9+ and so should ensure we do not produce any 'Illegal reflective access' errors when using netty.

Modifications:

Add jvmArgs when running our tests that will deny reflective access and so will fail the build at the end due not be able to load some classes.

Result:

Ensure we do not produce any illegal refelctive access errors when using java9+
