Removing a SeekAheadNoBackArrayException to avoid exception handling

Motivation:

A `SeekAheadNoBackArrayException` used as check for `ByteBuf#hasArray`. The catch of exceptions carries a large overhead on stack trace filling, and this should be avoided.

Modifications:

- Remove the class `SeekAheadNoBackArrayException` and replace its usage with `if` statements.
- Use methods from `ObjectUtils` for better readability.
- Make private methods static where it make sense.
- Remove unused private methods.

Result:

Less of exception handling logic, better performance.
