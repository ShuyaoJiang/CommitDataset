Throw NoSuchBufferException instead of returning null

- Exception in this case makes a user less confusing
- To reduce the overhead of filling the stack trace,
  NoSuchBufferException has a public pre-constructed instance.
  - This is necessary because codec framework sometimes need to support
    both type of outbound buffers.
- Fixed a bug where SpdyFrameEncoder did not handle ping messages
- Reduced memory copy in codec embedder (EmbeddedChannel)
