Mark transport-rxtx as @deprecated

Motivation:

transport-rxtx has no tests and there is really no easy way to add some. Beside this this transport is not really well maintained.

Modifications:

Mark transport-rxtx as @deprecated so we can drop it in next major version.

Result:

Notify users of plan to drop the transport.
