Get memory address from Unsafe for OpenSSL

Motivation:
Profiling tcnative SSL code showed a non trivial percentage (1%)
of time spent in JNI code for InstaceOf.   This turned out to be
from `Buffer.address` which makes a JNI call, which safely checks
on each call that The ByteBuffer is direct.

Modification:
Prefer using the address field of the pojo rather than looking it
up with JNI.  This is the same approach taken by the `OpenSsl`
class.

Result:
Less JNI overhead
