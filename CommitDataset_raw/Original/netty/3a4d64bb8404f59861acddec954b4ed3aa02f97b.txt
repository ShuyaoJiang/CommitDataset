Allow to receive a ChannelGroupFuture that will be notified once all Channels are closed.

Motivation:

It's useful to be able to be notified once all Channels that are part of the ChannelGroup are notified. This can for example be useful if you want to do a graceful shutdown.

Modifications:

- Add ChannelGroup.newCloseFuture(...) which will be notified once all Channels are notified that are part of the ChannelGroup at the time of calling.

Result:

Easier to be notified once all Channels within a ChannelGroup are closed.
