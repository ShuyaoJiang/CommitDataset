[#3623] CompositeByteBuf.iterator() should return optimized Iterable

Motivation:

CompositeByteBuf.iterator() currently creates a new ArrayList and fill it with the ByteBufs, which is more expensive then it needs to be.

Modifications:

- Use special Iterator implementation

Result:

Less overhead when calling iterator()
