Add workaround for bug in older linux kernels handling epoll_wait(...)

Motivation:

Older linux kernels have problems handling a large value for epoll_wait(...) and so wait for ever.

Modifications:

Adjust timeout on the fly if a too big value is passed in.

Result:

Correctly works also on older kernels.
