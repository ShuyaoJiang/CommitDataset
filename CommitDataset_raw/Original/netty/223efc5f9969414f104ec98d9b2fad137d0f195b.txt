Clean up the examples

Motivation:

The examples have not been updated since long time ago, showing various
issues fixed in this commit.

Modifications:

- Overall simplification to reduce LoC
  - Use system properties to get options instead of parsing args.
  - Minimize option validation
  - Just use System.out/err instead of Logger
  - Do not pass config as parameters - just access it directly
  - Move the main logic to main(String[]) instead of creating a new
    instance meaninglessly
    - Update netty-build-21 to make checkstyle not complain
  - Remove 'throws Exception' clause if possible
- Line wrap at 120 (previously at 80)
- Add an option to enable SSL for most examples
- Use ChannelFuture.sync() instead of await()
- Use System.out for the actual result. Use System.err otherwise.
- Delete examples that are not very useful:
  - applet
  - websocket/html5
  - websocketx/sslserver
  - localecho/multithreaded
- Add run-example.sh which simplifies launching an example from command
  line
- Rewrite FileServer example

Result:

Shorter and simpler examples.  A user can focus more on what it actually
does than miscellaneous stuff.  A user can launch an example very
easily.
