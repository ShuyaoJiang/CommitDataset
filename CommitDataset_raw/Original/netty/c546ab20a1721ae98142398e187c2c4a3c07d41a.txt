Ensure ByteToMessageDecoder.Cumulator implementations always release in buffer. (#8325)

Motivation:

We need to ensure the Cumulator always releases the input buffer if it can not take over the ownership of it as otherwise it may leak.

Modifications:

- Correctly ensure the buffer is always released.
- Add unit tests.

Result:

Ensure buffer is always released.
