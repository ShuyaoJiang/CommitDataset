Motivation: (#7848)

It is possible to create streams in the half-closed state where the
stream state doesn't reflect that the request headers have been sent by
the client or the server hasn't received the request headers. This
state isn't possible in the H2 spec as a half closed stream must have
either received a full request or have received the headers from a
pushed stream. In the current implementation, this can cause the stream
created as part of an h2c upgrade request to be in this invalid state
and result in the omission of RST frames as the client doesn't believe
it has sent the request to begin with.

Modification:

The `DefaultHttp2Connection.activate` method checks the state and
modifies the status of the request headers as appropriate.

Result:

Fixes #7847.
