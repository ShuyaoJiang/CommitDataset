Removed HeapByteBuffer address field check.

Motivation:

In JDK9 heap byte buffers have an address field, so we have to remove
the current check as it is invalid in JDK9.

Modifications:

Removed the address field check for heap byte buffers.

Result:
Netty continues to find sun.misc.Unsafe in JDK9 as in previous JDKs.
