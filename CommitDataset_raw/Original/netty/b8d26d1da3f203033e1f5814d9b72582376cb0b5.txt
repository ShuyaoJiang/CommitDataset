Avoid unnecessary call to ByteBuf.isReadable() from ByteToMessageDecoder

Motivation:

This will avoid one unncessary method invokation which will slightly improve performance.

Modifications:

Instead of calling isReadable we just check for the value of readableBytes()

Result:

Nothing functionally speaking change.
