Allow to create Epoll*Channel from FileDescriptor

Motivation:

Sometimes it's useful to be able to create a Epoll*Channel from an existing file descriptor. This is especially helpful if you integrade some c/jni code.

Modifications:

- Add extra constructor to Epoll*Channel implementations that take a FileDescriptor as an argument
- Make Rename EpollFileDescriptor to NativeFileDescriptor and make it public
- Also ensure we obtain the correct remote/local address when create a Channel from a FileDescriptor

Result:

It's now possible to create a FileDescriptor and instance a Epoll*Channel via it.
