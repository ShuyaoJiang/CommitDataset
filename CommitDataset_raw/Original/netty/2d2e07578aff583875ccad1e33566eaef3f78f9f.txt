Remove HashMap for lookup name / ctx from DefaultChannelPipeline to reduce memory footprint

Motivation:

If you start to have 1M+ concurrent connections memory footprint can be come a big issue. We should try to reduce it as much as possible in the core of netty.

Modifications:

- Remove HashMap that was used to store name to ctx mapping. This was only used for validation and access a handler by name. As a pipeline is not expected to be very long (like 100+ handlers) we can just walk the linked list structure to find the ctx with a given name.

Result:

Less memory footprint of the DefaultChannelPipeline.
