Include Http 1 request in error message

Motivation:

When An HTTP server is listening in plaintext mode, it doesn't have
a chance to negotiate "h2" in the tls handshake.  HTTP 1 clients
that are not expecting an HTTP2 server will accidentally a request
that isn't an upgrade, which the HTTP/2 decoder will not
understand.  The decoder treats the bytes as hex and adds them to
the error message.

These error messages are hard to understand by humans, and result
in extra, manual work to decode.

Modification:

If the first bytes of the request are not the preface, the decoder
will now see if they are an HTTP/1 request first.  If so, the error
message will include the method and path of the original request in
the error message.

In case the path is long, the decoder will check up to the first
1024 bytes to see if it matches.  This could be a DoS vector if
tons of bad requests or other garbage come in.  A future optimization
would be to treat the first few bytes as an AsciiString and not do
any Charset decoding.  ByteBuf.toCharSequence alludes to such an
optimization.

The code has been left simple for the time being.

Result:

Faster identification of errant HTTP requests.
