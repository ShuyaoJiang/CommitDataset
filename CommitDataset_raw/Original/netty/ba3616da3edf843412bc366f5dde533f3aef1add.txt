Apply appropriate methods for writing CharSequence into ByteBuf

Motivation:

1. `ByteBuf` contains methods to writing `CharSequence` which optimized for UTF-8 and ASCII encodings. We can also apply optimization for ISO-8859-1.
2. In many places appropriate methods are not used.

Modifications:

1. Apply optimization for ISO-8859-1 encoding in the `ByteBuf#setCharSequence` realizations.
2. Apply appropriate methods for writing `CharSequences` into buffers.

Result:

Reduce overhead from string-to-bytes conversion.
