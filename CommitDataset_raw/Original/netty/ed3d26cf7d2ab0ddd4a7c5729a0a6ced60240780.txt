[#3837] Null out ByteBuffer[] array once done

Motivation:

the ByteBuffer[] that we keep in the ThreadLocal are never nulled out which can lead to have ByteBuffer instances sit there forever.
This is even a bigger problem if nioBuffer() of ByteBuffer returns a new ByteBuffer that can not be destroyed by ByteBuffer.release().

Modifications:

Null out ByteBuffer array after processing.

Result:

No more dangling references after done.
