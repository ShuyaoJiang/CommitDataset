Fix HttpUtil.isKeepAlive to behave correctly when Connection is a comma separated list (#8924)

Motivation:

According to the specification, the "Connection" header's syntax is:

"
The Connection header field's value has the following grammar:

     Connection        = 1#connection-option
     connection-option = token

Connection options are case-insensitive.
"
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-6.1

This means that Connection's value can have at least one element or
a comma separated list with elements
When calculating whether the connection can remain open,
HttpUtil.isKeepAlive(HttpMessage) should take this into account.

Modifications:

- Check for "close" and "keep-alive" in a comma separated list
- Add unit test

Result:

HttpUtil.isKeepAlive(HttpMessage) works correctly when "Connection: Upgrade, close"
