Prefer JDK ThreadLocalRandom implementation over ours.

Motivation:

We have our own ThreadLocalRandom implementation to support older JDKs . That said we should prefer the JDK provided when running on JDK >= 7

Modification:

Using ThreadLocalRandom implementation of the JDK when possible.

Result:

Make use of JDK implementations when possible.
