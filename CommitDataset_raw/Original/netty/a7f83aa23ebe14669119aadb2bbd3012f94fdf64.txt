HTTP/2 Example Needs FullHttpRequest

Motivation:
The HTTP/2 hello world example server should be expecting a FullHttpRequest when falling back to HTTP/1.x mode.

Modifications:
- HelloWorldHttp1Handler should process FullHttpRequestObjects
- Http2ServerInitializer should insert an HttpObjectAggregator into the pipeline if no upgrade was attempted

Result:
Responses from the HelloWorldHttp1Handler should only come after full HTTP requests are received.
