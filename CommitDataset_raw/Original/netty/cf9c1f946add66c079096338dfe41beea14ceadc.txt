Deleting redundant needsFlush boolean

Motivation:

In ChunkedWriteHandler, there is a redundant variable that servers
no purpose. It implies that under some conditions you might not want
to flush.

Modifications:

Removed the variable and the if condition that read it. The boolean
was always true so just removing the if statement was fine.

Result:

Slightly less misleading code.
