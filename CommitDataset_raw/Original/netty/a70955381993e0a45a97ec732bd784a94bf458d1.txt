Allow to use EmbeddedChannel.schedule*(...)

Motivation:

At the moment when EmbeddedChannel is used and a ChannelHandler tries to schedule and task it will throw an UnsupportedOperationException. This makes it impossible to test these handlers or even reuse them with EmbeddedChannel.

Modifications:

- Factor out reusable scheduling code into AbstractSchedulingEventExecutor
- Let EmbeddedEventLoop and SingleThreadEventExecutor extend AbstractSchedulingEventExecutor
- add EmbbededChannel.runScheduledPendingTasks() which allows to run all scheduled tasks that are ready

Result:

Embeddedchannel is now usable even with ChannelHandler that try to schedule tasks.
