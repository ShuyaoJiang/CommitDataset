[#3364] Not use VoidChannelPromise in SslHandler to guard against IllegalStateException

Motivation:

SslHandler adds a pending write with an empty buffer and a VoidChannelPromise when a user flush and not pending writes are currently stored. This may produce an IllegalStateException later if the user try to add a ChannelFutureListener to the promise in the next ChannelOutboundHandler.

Modifications:

Replace ctx.voidPromise() with ctx.newPromise()

Result:

No more IllegalStateException possible
