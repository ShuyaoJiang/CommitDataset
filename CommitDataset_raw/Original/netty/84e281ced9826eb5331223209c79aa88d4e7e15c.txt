fix one java doc issue: extra }

Motivation:

There is one extra } for WriteBufferWaterMark's javadoc:
{@linkplain #high}  high water mark}

The generated javadoc will show the content: "the high high water mark}"

Modifications:

remove the }

Result:
The generated javadoc will show the content: "the high water mark" instead of "the high high water mark}"
