Improvement : WebSocketServerProtocolHandshakeHandler.getWebSocketLocation now applies concat optimization and WebSocket path check moved to separated method.

Motivation:

Make code easier to read, make WebSocketServerProtocolHandshakeHandler.getWebSocketLocation method faster.

Modification:

WebSocket path check moved to separate method. Get header operation moved out from concat operation.

Result:

WebSocketServerProtocolHandshakeHandler.getWebSocketLocation is faster as OptimizeStringConcat could be applied. Code easier to read.
