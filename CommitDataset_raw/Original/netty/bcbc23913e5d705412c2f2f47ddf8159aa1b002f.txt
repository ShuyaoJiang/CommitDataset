Better fix for TrafficShapingHandlerTest

Motivation:
The test procedure is unstable when testing quick time (factor less or equal to 1). Changing to default 10ms in this case will force time to be correct and time to be checked only when factor is >= 2.

Modifications:
When factor is <= 1, minimalWaitBetween is 10ms

Result:
Hoping this version is finally stable.
