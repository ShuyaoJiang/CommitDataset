Cleanup SSL test. (#8301)

Motivation:

I noticed that we had some errors showing up in a test (which did not fail it tho) because we tried to full-fill the promise multiples times.

Modifications:

Use trySuccess(...) as we may produce multiple exceptions.

Result:

Less errors during test-run.
