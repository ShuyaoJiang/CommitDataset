- Replaced pipeline factories with initializers
- Ported essential parts related with HTTP to the new API
- Replaced ChannelHandlerAdapter.combine() with CombinedChannelHandler
- Fixed a bug where ReplayingDecoder does not notify the next handler
- Fixed a bug where ReplayingDecoder calls wrong callDecode() method
- Added a destination buffer as an argument to AbstractChannel.doRead()
  for easier implementation
- Fixed a bug where NioSocketChannel did not try to increase the inbound
  buffer size (moved the logic to AbstractChannel)
