Ensure ChannelHandlerContext.attr(...) and ChannelHandlerContext.hasAttr(...) has no semantic change

Motivation:

The ChannelHandlerContext.attr(...) and ChannelHandlerContext.hasAttr(...) delegated to Channel for the attributes which is a semantic change compared to 4.0 releases. We should not change the semantic to not break users applications when upgrading to 4.1.0

Modifications:

- Revert semantic change
- Mark ChannelHandlerContext.attr(...) and hasAttr(...) as @deprecated so we can remove these later

Result:

Semantic of attribute operations on ChannelHandlerContext is the same in 4.1 as in 4.0 again.
