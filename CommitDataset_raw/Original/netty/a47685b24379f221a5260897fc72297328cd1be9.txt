Use bitwise operation when sampling for resource leak detection.

Motivation:

Modulo operations are slow, we can use bitwise operation to detect if resource leak detection must be done while sampling.

Modifications:

- Ensure the interval is a power of two
- Use bitwise operation for sampling
- Add benchmark.

Result:

Faster sampling.
