Change minimum JDK version for compilation to 1.8

Motivation:

We previously changed netty to always compile with java7 as otherwise source compatibility was broken.

This was reported in [#3548] but was fixed in the meantime:
- https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8029240
- https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8030855

Modifications:

Change minimum JDK version for compilation to 1.8

Result:

Easier to maintain code.
