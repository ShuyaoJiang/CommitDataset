fix 5868 -fix DefaultHostsFileEntriesResolverTest to pass on windows 7

Motivation:

Windows 7 hosts file is empty by default (at least on my machine? see
http://serverfault.com/questions/4689/windows-7-localhost-name-resolution-is-handled-within-dns-itself-why
for details and reasoning.

the test relies on the file containing an entry for localhost.

Modifications:

refactor class code to 1st normalize the input host name and then look it up, change the test to verify
that hostnames are normalized in a case-insensitive way before being looked up (which was the intent
of the original test)

Result:

test should pass on vanilla windows 7 (and any other machine with no
localhost in the hosts file). no effect anywhere else or on actual netty
code.
