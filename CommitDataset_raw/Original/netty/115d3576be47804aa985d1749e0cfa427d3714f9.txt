Update the public DNS server list

Motivation:

Some DNS servers in DnsNameResolverTest are outdated and some of them
returns NoError for non-existent domains.

Modifications:

- Update the DNS server list from http://meo.ws/dnsrec.php again
- Update the web-scraper script

Result:

DnsNameResolverTest.testNegativeTtl() should not fail anymore.
