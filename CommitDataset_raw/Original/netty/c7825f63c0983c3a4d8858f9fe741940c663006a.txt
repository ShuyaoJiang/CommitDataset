Fix a bug in DefaultPromise.notifyLateListener() where the listener is not notified

Motivation:

When (listeners == null && lateListeners == null) and (stackDepth >= MAX_LISTENER_STACK_DEPTH), the listener is not notified at all. The discard client does not work.

Modification:

Make sure to submit the notification task.

Result:

The discard client works again and all listeners are notified.
