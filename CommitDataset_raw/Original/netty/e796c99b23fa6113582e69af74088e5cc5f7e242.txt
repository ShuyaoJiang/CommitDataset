Add unit tests for HTTP and SPDY headers

Motivation:

When attempting to retrieve a SPDY header using an AsciiString key, if the header was inserted using a String based key, the lookup would fail. Similarly, the lookup would fail if the header was inserted with an AsciiString key, and retrieved using a String key. This has been fixed with the header simplification commit (1a43923aa89769ae3711e0d9451abfdee4a4327c).

Extra unit tests have been added to protect against this issue occurring in the future.  The tests check that a header added using String or AsciiString can be retrieved using AsciiString or String respectively.

Modifications:

Added more unit tests

Result:

Protect against issue #4053 happening again.
