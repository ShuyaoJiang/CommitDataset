Fix 'incompatible event loop' regression

Motivation:

Previous commit (2de65e25e90dec5c0a28b2d57e6c6d15d5a49087) introduced a regression that makes the epoll testsuite fail with an 'incompatible event loop' error.

Modifications:

Use the correct event loop type.

Result:

Build doesn't fail anymore.
