Add assert to ensure we not create an endless loop and fix unsafe publication

Motivation:

[#6153] reports an endless loop that existed in the Recycler, while this was fixed adding a few asserts to ensure this remains fixed is a good thing. Beside this we also should ensure this can not escape the constructor to avoid unsafe publication.

Modifications:

- Add asserts
- Fix unsafe publication

Result:

More correct code.
