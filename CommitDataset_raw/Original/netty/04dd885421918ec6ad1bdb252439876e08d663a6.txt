SPDY: fix support for pushed resources in SpdyHttpEncoder

Motivation:

The SpdyHttpDecoder was modified to support pushed resources that are
divided into multiple frames. The decoder accepts a pushed
SpdySynStreamFrame containing the request headers, followed by a
SpdyHeadersFrame containing the response headers.

Modifications:

This commit modifies the SpdyHttpEncoder so that it encodes pushed
resources in a format that the SpdyHttpDecoder can decode. The encoder
will accept an HttpRequest object containing the request headers,
followed by an HttpResponse object containing the response headers.

Result:

The SpdyHttpEncoder will create a SpdySynStreamFrame followed by a
SpdyHeadersFrame when sending pushed resources.
