Handle the case where JDK notifies aync I/O handler immediately

After some debugging, I found that JDK AIO implementation often performs
I/O immediately from the caller thread if the caller thread is the I/O
thread, and notifies the completion handler also immediately.  This
commit handles such a case correctly during reads and writes.

Additionally, this commit also changes SingleThreadEventExecutor to let
it handle unexpected exceptions such as AssertionError in a robus
manner.
