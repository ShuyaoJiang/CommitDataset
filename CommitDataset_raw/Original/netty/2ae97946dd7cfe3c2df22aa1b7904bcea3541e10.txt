Allow to retrieve the number of active bytes per PoolArena.

Motivation:

To better understand how much memory is used by Netty for ByteBufs it is useful to understand how many bytes are currently active (allocated) per PoolArena.

Modifications:

- Add PoolArenaMetric.numActiveBytes()

Result:

The user is able to get better insight into the PooledByteBufAllocator.
