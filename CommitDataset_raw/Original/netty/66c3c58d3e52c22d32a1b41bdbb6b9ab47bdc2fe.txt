Reduce object creation for for unwrap/wrap if no ByteBuffer[] is used.

Motivation:

Often unwrap(...), wrap(...) is used with a single ByteBuffer and not with a ByteBuffer[]. We should reduce the array creations in this case.

Modifications:

Reuse ByteBuffer[1] for dst/src ByteBuffer.

Result:

Less object creation and so less GC
