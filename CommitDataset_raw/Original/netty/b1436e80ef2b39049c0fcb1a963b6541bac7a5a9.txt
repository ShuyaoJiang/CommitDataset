Cleanup DefaultHttp2FrameReader about verifyUnknownFrame

Motivation:

In previous PR about handling unknwon frame in the middle of header
block, I didn't notice and re-use about checking is processing header
. And I added a redundant method for same functionality.
I think that the redundant method would lead to some misleading
situation.

Modifications:

Removed redundant code on DefaultHttp2FrameReader

Result:

The code is more readable
