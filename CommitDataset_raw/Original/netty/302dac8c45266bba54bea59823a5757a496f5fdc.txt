Support 1012, 1013 and 1014 WebSocket close status code (#8664)

Motivation:

RFC 6455 doesn't define close status codes 1012, 1013 and 1014.
Yet, since then, IANA has defined them and web browsers support them.

From https://www.iana.org/assignments/websocket/websocket.xhtml:

* 1012: Service Restart
* 1013: Try Again Later
* 1014: The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and received an invalid response from the upstream server. This is similar to 502 HTTP Status Code.

Modification:

Make status codes 1012, 1013 and 1014 legit.

Result:

WebSocket status codes as defined by IANA are supported.
