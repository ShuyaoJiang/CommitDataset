Allow MessageAggregator to disallow non-empty content

Motivation:

A user sometimes just want the aggregated message has no content at
all. (e.g. A user only wants HTTP GET requests.)

Modifications:

- Do not raise IllegalArgumentException even if a user specified
  the maxContentLength of 0

Result:

A user can disallow a message with non-empty content.
