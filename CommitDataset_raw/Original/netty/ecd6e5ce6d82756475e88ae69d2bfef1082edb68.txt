CorsHandler to respect http connection (keep-alive) header.

Motivation:

The CorsHandler currently closes the channel when it responds to a preflight (OPTIONS)
request or in the event of a short circuit due to failed validation.

Especially in an environment where there's a proxy in front of the service this causes
unnecessary connection churn.

Modifications:

CorsHandler now uses HttpUtil to determine if the connection should be closed
after responding

Result:

Channel will stay open when the CorsHandler responds unless the client specifies otherwise
or the protocol version is HTTP/1.0
