Prevent unnecessary allocations in the `StringUtil#escapeCsv`

Motivation:

A `StringUtil#escapeCsv` creates new `StringBuilder` on each value even if the same string is returned in the end.

Modifications:

Create new `StringBuilder` only if it really needed. Otherwise, return the original string (or just trimmed substring).

Result:

Less GC load. Up to 4x faster work for not changed strings.
