OpenSslEngine.getSupportedCipherSuites() must return java names as well.

Motivation:

At the moment OpenSslEngine.getSupportedCipherSuites() only return the original openssl cipher names and not the java names. We need also include the java names.

Modifications:

Correctly return the java names as well.

Result:

Correct implementation of OpenSslEngine.getSupportedCipherSuites()
