HTTP/2 SimplePromiseAggregator tryFailure not consistent with setFailure

Motivation:
The SimplePromiseAggregator.setFailure allows a failure to occur before newPromise is called, but tryFailure doesn't. These methods should be consistent.

Modifications:
- tryFailure should use the same logic as setFailure

Result:
Consistent failure routines.
