Don't trim stacktrace for exceptions when running mvn test (#7981)

Motivation:

The maven surefire plugin will trim stacktraces by default which makes these kind of use-less when trying to understand why an test failed because one was thrown.

Modifications:

Configure the plugin to not trim the stacktrace.

Result:

Easier to debug test-failures.
