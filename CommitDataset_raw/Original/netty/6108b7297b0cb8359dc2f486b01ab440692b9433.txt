Correctly handle ChannelInputShutdownEvent in ReplayingDecoder

Motivation:

b112673554bafc1eccfd43913a3e8605337dd7fb added ChannelInputShutdownEvent support to ByteToMessageDecoder but missed updating the code for ReplayingDecoder. This has the effect:

- If a ChannelInputShutdownEvent is fired ByteToMessageDecoder (the super-class of ReplayingDecoder) will call the channelInputClosed(...) method which will pass the incorrect buffer to the decode method of ReplayingDecoder.

Modifications:

Share more code between ByteToMessageDEcoder and ReplayingDecoder and so also support ChannelInputShutdownEvent correctly in ReplayingDecoder

Result:

ChannelInputShutdownEvent is corrrectly handle in ReplayingDecoder as well.
