Not add ChannelHandler to ChannelPipeline once the pipeline was destroyed.

Motivation:

ChannelPipeline will happily add a handler to a closed Channel's pipeline and will call handlerAdded(...) but will not call handlerRemoved(...).

Modifications:

Check if pipeline was destroyed and if so not add the handler at all but propergate an exception.

Result:

Fixes [#6768]
