Move "fallthrough" statement to where fall actually happens Motivation: Static analysis looks for error prone switch case statements. Accidental fall through is one such case, but it is sometimes intentional. To indicate this, the "//fallthrough" comment can be added before the fall.

The code in question has this comment, but it is *after* the fall
so the static analysis flags it.

This is described in http://errorprone.info/bugpattern/FallThrough

Modifications:
Move fall through comment to where the fall actually occurs

Result:
More compatible with Error Prone tools
