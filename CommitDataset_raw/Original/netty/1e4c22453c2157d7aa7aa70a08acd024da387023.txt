Do not use finally to propagate events in AbstractRemoteAddressFilter

Motivation:

We don't really need to propagate an event when handling the event fails.

Modifications:

Do not use finally block in AbstractRemoteAddressFilter

Result:

AbstractRemoteaddressFilter does not forward an event in case of failure.
