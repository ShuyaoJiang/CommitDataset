[#4635] Stop decoding if decoder was removed

Motivation:

We need to check if this handler was removed before continuing with decoding.
If it was removed, it is not safe to continue to operate on the buffer.

Modifications:

Check if decoder was removed after fire messages through the pipeline.

Result:

No illegal buffer access when decoder was removed.
