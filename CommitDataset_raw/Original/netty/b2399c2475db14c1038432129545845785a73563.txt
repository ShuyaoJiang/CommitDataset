EPOLL Shutdown Input Half Closed

Motivation:
EPOLL attempts to support half closed socket, but fails to call shutdown to close the read portion of the file descriptor.

Motivation:
- If half closed is supported shutting down the input should call underlying Native.shutdown(...) to make sure the peer is notified of the half closed state.

Result:
EPOLL half closed is more correct.
