Handle the backslash with double quote in JsonObjectDecoder

Motivation:

The double quote may be escaped in a JSON string, but JsonObjectDecoder doesn't handle it. Resolves #5157.

Modifications:

Don't end a JSON string when processing an escaped double quote.

Result:

JsonObjectDecoder can handle backslash and double quote in a JSON string correctly.
