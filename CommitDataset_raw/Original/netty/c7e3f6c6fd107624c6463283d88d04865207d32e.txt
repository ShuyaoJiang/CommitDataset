HTTP/2 defines using String instead of CharSequence

Motivation:
Http2CodecUtils has some static variables which are defined as Strings instead of CharSequence. One of these defines is used as a header name and should be AsciiString.

Modifications:
- Change the String defines in Http2CodecUtils to CharSequence

Result:
Types are more consistently using CharSequence and adding the upgrade header will require less work.
