Not use Unpooled to allocate buffers in Base64 but use a ByteBufAllocator

Motivation:

We should not use Unpooled to allocate buffers for performance reasons.

Modifications:

Allow to pass in ByteBufAllocate which is used to allocate buffers or use the allocate of the src buffer.

Result:

Better performance if the PooledByteBufAllocator is used.
