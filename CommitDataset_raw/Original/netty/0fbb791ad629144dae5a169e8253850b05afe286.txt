Make AbstractChannel.outboundBuffer volatile.

Motivation:

The field can be read from arbitrary threads via Channel.(isWritable()|bytesBeforeWritable()|bytesBeforeUnwritable()), WriteAndFlushTask.newInstance(), PendingWriteQueue, etc.

Modifications:

Make AbstractChannel.outboundBuffer volatile.

Result:

More correct in a concurrent use case.
