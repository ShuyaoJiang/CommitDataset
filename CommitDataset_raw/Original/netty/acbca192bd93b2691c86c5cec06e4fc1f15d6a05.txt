ChannelConfig operations should wrap ClosedChannelException if Channel was closed before.

Motivation:

To be consistent with the JDK we should ensure our native methods throw a ClosedChannelException if the Channel was previously closed. This will then be wrapped in a ChannelException as usual. For all other errors we continue to just throw a ChannelException directly.

Modifications:

Ensure getsockopt and setsockopt will throw a ClosedChannelException if the channel was closed before, on other errors we throw a ChannelException as before diretly.

Result:

Consistent with the NIO Channel implementations.
