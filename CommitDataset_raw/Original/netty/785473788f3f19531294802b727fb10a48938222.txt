(Nio|Epoll)EventLoop.pendingTasks does not need to dispatch to the EventLoop  (#8197)

Motivation:

EventLoop.pendingTasks should be (reasonably) cheap to invoke so it can be used within observability. 

Modifications:

Remove code that dispatch access to the internal taskqueue to the EventLoop when invoked as this is not needed anymore with the current MPSC queues we are using. 

See https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/8196#issuecomment-413653286.

Result:

Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/8196
