Add HttpServerKeepAliveHandler

Motivation:

As discussed in #5738, developers need to concern themselves with setting
connection: keep-alive on the response as well as whether to close a
connection or not after writing a response.  This leads to special keep-alive
handling logic in many different places.  The purpose of the HttpServerKeepAliveHandler
is to allow developers to add this handler to their pipeline and therefore
free themselves of having to worry about the details of how Keep-Alive works.

Modifications:

Added HttpServerKeepAliveHandler to the io.netty.handler.codec.http package.

Result:

Developers can start using HttpServerKeepAliveHandler in their pipeline instead
of worrying about when to close a connection for keep-alive.
