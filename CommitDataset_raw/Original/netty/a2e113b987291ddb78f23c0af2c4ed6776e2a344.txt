Use ByteProcessor.FIND_LF to find end of line

Motivation:

Each call of ByteBuf.getByte(int) method does boundary checking. This can be eliminated by using ByteBuf.forEachByte(ByteProcessor) method and ByteProcessor.FIND_LF processor.

Modifications:

Find end of line with ByteProcessor.FIND_LF

Result:

A little better performance of LineBasedFrameDecoder.
