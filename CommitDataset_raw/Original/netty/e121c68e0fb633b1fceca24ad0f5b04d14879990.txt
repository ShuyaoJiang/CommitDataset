Created RTSPEncoder and RTSPDecoder which are now common for both requests and responses to be able to handle both types of messages on the same channel.

Keep RTSPRequestEncoder, RTSPRequestDecoder, RTSPResponseEncoder and
RTSPResponseDecoder for backwards compatibility but they now just extends
the generic encoder/decoder and are markes as deprecated.

Renamed the decoder test, because the decoder is now generic. Added
testcase for when ANNOUNCE request is received from server.

Created testcases for encoder.

Mark abstract base classes RTSPObjectEncoder and RTSPObjectDecoder as
deprecated, that functionality is now in RTSPEncoder and RTSPDecoder.

Added annotation in RtspHeaders to suppress warnings about deprecation, no need when
whole class is deprecated.
