Ensure buffer is not released when call array() / memoryAddress()

Motivation:

Before we missed to check if a buffer was released before we return the backing byte array or memoryaddress. This could lead to JVM crashes when someone tried various bulk operations on the Unsafe*ByteBuf implementations.

Modifications:

Always check if the buffer is released before all to return the byte array and memoryaddress.

Result:

No more JVM crashes because of released buffers when doing bulk operations on Unsafe*ByteBuf implementations.
