ALPN/NPN Examples Not using failure behavior compatible with all SslProviders

Motivation:
Examples that are using ALPN/NPN are using a failure mode which is not supported by the JDK SslProvider. The examples fail to run and throw an exception if the JDK SslProvider is used.

Modifications:
- Use SelectorFailureBehavior.NO_ADVERTISE
- Use SelectedListenerFailureBehavior.ACCEPT

Result:
Examples can be run with both OpenSsl and JDK SslProviders.
