Customizable estimation for messages written outside the EventLoop

Motivation:

Estimation algorithm currently used for WriteTasks is complicated and
wrong. Additionally, some code relies on outbound buffer size
incremented only on actual writes to the outbound buffer.

Modifications:

- Throw away the old estimator and replace with a simple algorithm that
  uses the client-provided estimator along with a statically configured
  WriteTask overhead (io.netty.transport.writeTaskSizeOverhead system
  property with the default value of 48 bytes)
- Add a io.netty.transport.estimateSizeOnSubmit boolean system property
  allowing the clients to disable the message estimation outside the
  event loop

Result:

Task estimation is user controllable and produces better results by
default
