Ensure Bootstrap.connect(...) not throw IllegalStateException when registration is delayed.

Motivation:

Bootstrap.connect(...) tries to obtain the EventLoop of a Channel before it may be registered. This will cause an IllegalStateException. We need to ensure we handle the cause of late registration and not throw in this case.

Modifications:

Ensure we only try to access the EventLoop after the Channel is registered and handle the case of late registration.

Result:

Bootstrap.connect(...) not fails on late registration.
