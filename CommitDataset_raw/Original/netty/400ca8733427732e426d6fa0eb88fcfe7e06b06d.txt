Provide an API for controlling and h2c upgrade response stream in Http2MultiplexCodec (#7968)

Motivation:

Http2MultiplexCodec doesn't currently have an API for using the response
of a h2c upgrade request.

Modifications:

Add a new API to the Http2MultiplexCodecBuilder which allows for setting
an upgrade handler and wire it into the Http2MultiplexCodec
implementation.

Result:

When using the Http2MultiplexCodec with h2c upgrades the upgrade handler
will get added to the Http2StreamChannel which represents the
half-closed (local) response of stream 1. It is then up to the user to
manage the transition from the IO channel pipeline configuration
necessary for making the h2c upgrade request to a form where it can read
the response from the new stream channel.

Fixes #7947.
