Fix tiny typo in FixedChannelPool error message (#7918)

Motivation:

Closed `FixedChannelPool` fails acquire and release operations with
`IllegalStateException`s. These exceptions had message
"FixedChannelPooled was closed". Here "FixedChannelPooled" looks like
a typo and should probably be "FixedChannelPool".

Modifications:

Changed exception message to "FixedChannelPool was closed".

Result:

A tiny bit cleaner exception message.
