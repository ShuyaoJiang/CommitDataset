Allow to access memoryAddress of wrapped ByteBuf for ReadOnlyByteBuf

Motivation:

We should allow to access the memoryAddress of the wrapped ByteBuf when using ReadOnlyByteBuf for peformance reasons. If a user act on a memoryAddress its his responsible anyway to do nothing "stupid".

Modifications:

Delegate to wrapped ByteBuf.

Result:

Less performance overhead for various operations and also when writing to a native transport (which needs the memoryAddress).
