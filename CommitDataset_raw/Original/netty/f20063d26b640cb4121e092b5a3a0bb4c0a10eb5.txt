SslHandler#wrapNonAppData return early

Motivation:

SslHandler#wrapNonAppData may be able to return early if it is called from a unwrap method and the status is NEED_UNWRAP. This has been observed to occur while using the OpenSslEngine and can avoid allocation of an extra ByteBuf of size 2048.

Modifications:
- Return early from SslHandler#wrapNonAppData if NEED_UNWRAP and we are called from an unwrap method

Result:
Less buffer allocations and early return from SslHandler#wrapNonAppData.
