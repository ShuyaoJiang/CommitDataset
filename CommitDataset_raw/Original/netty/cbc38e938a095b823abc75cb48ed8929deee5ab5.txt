UNSAFE.throwException null arg crashes JVM

Motivation:
It has been observed that passing a null argument to Unsafe.throwException can crash the JVM.

Modifications:
- PlatformUnsafe0.throwException should honor http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-14.html#jls-14.18 and throw a NPE

Result:
No risk of JVM crashing for null argument.
