Retained[Duplicate|Slice] operations should not increase the reference count for UnreleasableByteBuf

Motivation:
UnreleasableByteBuf operations are designed to not modify the reference count of the underlying buffer. The Retained[Duplicate|Slice] operations violate this assumption and can cause the underlying buffer's reference count to be increased, but never allow for it to be decreased. This may lead to memory leaks.

Modifications:
- UnreleasableByteBuf's Retained[Duplicate|Slice] should leave the reference count of the parent buffer unchanged after the operation completes.

Result:
No more memory leaks due to usage of the Retained[Duplicate|Slice] on an UnreleasableByteBuf object.
