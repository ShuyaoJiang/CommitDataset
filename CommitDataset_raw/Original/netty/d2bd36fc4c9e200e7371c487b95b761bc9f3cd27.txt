ByteBufUtil.isText method should be safe to be called concurrently

Motivation:

ByteBufUtil.isText(...) may produce unexpected results if called concurrently on the same ByteBuffer.

Modifications:

- Don't use internalNioBuffer where it is not safe.
- Add unit test.

Result:

ByteBufUtil.isText is thread-safe.
