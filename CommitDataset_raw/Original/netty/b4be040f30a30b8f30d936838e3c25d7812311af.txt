Introduce DnsCache API + DnsResolver extensibility

Motivation:
Caching is currently nested in DnsResolver.
It should also be possible to extend DnsResolver to ba able to pass a different cache on each resolution attemp.

Modifications:

* Introduce DnsCache, NoopDnsCache and DefaultDnsCache. The latter contains all the current caching logic that was extracted.
* Introduce protected versions of doResolve and doResolveAll that can be used as extension points to build resolvers that bypass the main cache and use a different one on each resolution.

Result:

Isolated caching logic. Better extensibility.
