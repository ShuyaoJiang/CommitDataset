Make build pass on Java 10 (#7922)

Motivation:

Java 10 is out so we should be able to build netty with it (and run the tests).

Modifications:

- Update Mockito and JBoss Marshalling to support Java 10
- Fix unit test to not depend on specific cipher which is not present in Java 10 anymore

Result:

Netty builds (and runs all tests) when using Java 10
