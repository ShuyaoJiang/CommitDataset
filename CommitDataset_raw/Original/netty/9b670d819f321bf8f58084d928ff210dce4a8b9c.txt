[#2144] Fix NPE in Local transport caused by a race

Motivation:
At the moment it is possible to see a NPE when the LocalSocketChannels doRegister() method is called and the LocalSocketChannels doClose() method is called before the registration was completed.

Modifications:
Make sure we delay the actual close until the registration task was executed.

Result:
No more NPE
