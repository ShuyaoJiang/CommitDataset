HpackDecoder treats invalid pseudo-headers as stream level errors

Motivation:

The HTTP/2 spec dictates that invalid pseudo-headers should cause the
request/response to be treated as malformed (8.1.2.1), and the recourse
for that is to treat the situation as a stream error of type
PROTOCOL_ERROR (8.1.2.6). However, we're treating them as a connection
error with the connection being immediately torn down and the HPACK
state potentially being corrupted.

Modifications:

The HpackDecoder now throws a StreamException for validation failures
and throwing is deffered until the end of of the decode phase to ensure
that the HPACK state isn't corrupted by returning early.

Result:

Behavior more closely aligned with the HTTP/2 spec.

Fixes #8043.
