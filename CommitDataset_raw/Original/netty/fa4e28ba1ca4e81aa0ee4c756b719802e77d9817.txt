Fix random number generators in WebSocketUtil

Motivation:

Implementation of WebSocketUtil/randomNumber is incorrect and might violate
the API returning values > maximum specified.

Modifications:

* WebSocketUtil/randomNumber is reimplemented, the idea of the solution described
  in the comment in the code

* Implementation of WebSocketUtil/randomBytes changed to nextBytes method

* PlatformDependet.threadLocalRandom is used instead of Math.random to improve efficiency

* Added test cases to check random numbers generator

* To ensure corretness, we now assert that min < max when generating random number

Result:

WebSocketUtil/randomNumber always produces correct result.
