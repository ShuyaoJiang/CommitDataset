[#4828] OpenSslContext throws UnsupportedOperationException when Unsafe not available

Motivation:

OpenSslContext constructor fails with a UnsupportedOperationException if Unsafe is not present on the system.

Modifications:

Make OpenSslContext work also when Unsafe is not present by fallback to using JNI to get the memory address.

Result:

Using OpenSslContext also works on systems without Unsafe.
