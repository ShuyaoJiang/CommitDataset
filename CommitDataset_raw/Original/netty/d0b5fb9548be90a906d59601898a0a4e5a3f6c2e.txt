[#2768] Correctly duplicate buffer for CloseWebSocketFrames

Motivation:

The _0XFF_0X00 buffer is not duplicated and empty after the first usage preventing the connection close to happen on subsequent close frames.

Modifications:

Correctly duplicate the buffer.

Result:

Multiple CloseWebSocketFrames are handled correctly.
