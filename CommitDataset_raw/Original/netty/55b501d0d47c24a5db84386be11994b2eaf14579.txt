Correctly update Channel writability when queueing data in SslHandler.

Motivation:

A regression was introduced in 86e653e which had the effect that the writability was not updated for a Channel while queueing data in the SslHandler.

Modifications:

- Factor out code that will increment / decrement pending bytes and use it in AbstractCoalescingBufferQueue and PendingWriteQueue
- Add test-case

Result:

Channel writability changes are triggered again.
