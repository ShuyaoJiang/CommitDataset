HTTP/2 child channel read cycle doesn't respect RecvByteBufAllocator and (#8147)

Motivation:
Http2MultiplexCodec queues data internally if data is delivered from the
parent channel but the child channel did not request data. If the parent
channel notifies of a stream closure it is possible data in the queue
will be discarded before closing the channel.
Http2MultiplexCodec interacts with RecvByteBufAllocator to control the
child channel's demand for read. However it currently only ever reads a
maximum of one time per loop. This can thrash the read loop and bloat
the call stack if auto read is on, because channelReadComplete will
re-enter the read loop synchronously, and also neglect to deliver data
during the parent's read loop (if it is active). This also meant the
readPendingQueue was not utilized as originally intended (to extend the
child channel's read loop during the parent channel's read loop if
demand for data still existed).

Modifications:
- Modify the child channel's read loop to respect the
RecvByteBufAllocator, and append to the parents readPendingQueue if
appropriate.
- Stream closure notification behaves like EPOLL and KQUEUE transports
and reads all queued data, because the data is already queued in memory
and it is known there will be no more data. This will also replenish the
connection flow control window which may otherwise be constrained by a
closed stream.

Result:
More correct read loop and less risk of dropping data.
