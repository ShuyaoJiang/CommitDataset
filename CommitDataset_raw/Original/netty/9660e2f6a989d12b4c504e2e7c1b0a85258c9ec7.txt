Better handling of BUFFER_OVERFLOW when unwrap data.

Motivation:

When we detect a BUFFER_OVERFLOW we should just forward the already produced data and allocate a new buffer and NOT do any extra memory copies while trying to expand the buffer.

Modifications:

When a BUFFER_OVERFLOW is returned and some data was produced just fire this data through the pipeline and allocate a new buffer to read again.

Result:

Less memorycopies and so better performance.
