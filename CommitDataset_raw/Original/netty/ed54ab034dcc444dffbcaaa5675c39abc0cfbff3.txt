Correctly clear the error stack in all cases when using ReferenceCountedOpenSslEngine. (#7941)

Motivation:

We missed to correctly clear the error stack in one case when using the ReferenceCountedOpenSslEngine. Because of this it was possible to pick up an error on an unrelated operation.

Modifications:

- Correctly clear the stack
- Add verification of empty error stack to tests.

Result:

Not possible to observe unrelated errors.
