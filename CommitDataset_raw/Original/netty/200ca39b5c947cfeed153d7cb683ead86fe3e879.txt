Add PooledByteBufAllocator.dumpStats() which allows to obtain a human-readable status of the allocator.

Motiviation:

Sometimes it is useful to dump the status of the PooledByteBufAllocator and log it. Doing this is currently a bit cumbersome as the user needs to basically iterate through all the metrics and compose the String. we would better provide an easy way to do this.

Modification:

Add dumpStats() method.

Result:

Easier to get a view into the status of the allocator.
