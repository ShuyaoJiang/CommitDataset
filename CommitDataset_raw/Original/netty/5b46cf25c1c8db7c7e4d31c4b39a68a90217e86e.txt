Fulfill the write promise of empty HTTP/2 DATA frames sooner

Motivation:

DefaultHttp2ConnectionEncoder.FlowControlledData.write() does not
complete the write promise of empty HTTP/2 DATA frames until either a
non-DATA frame, a non-empty DATA frame or a DATA frame with endOfStream
set. This makes the write promise of the empty DATA frame is notified
much later than it could be.

Modifications:

- Notify the write promise of the empty DATA frames immediately is the
  queue contains empty DATA frames only

Result:

The write promise of an empty DATA frame is notified sooner.
