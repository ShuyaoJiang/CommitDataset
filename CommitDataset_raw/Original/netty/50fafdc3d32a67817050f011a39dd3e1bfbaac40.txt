Rewrite SslHandler / Reduce the chance of OIO-OIO dead lock

- SslHandler always begins handshake unless startTls is true
  - Removed issueHandshake property
  - If a user wants to start handshake later, he/she has to add 
    SslHandler later.
- Removed enableRenegotiation property
  - JDK upgrade fixes the security vulnerability - no need to complicate
    our code
- Some property name changes
  - getSSLEngineInboundCloseFuture() -> sslCloseFuture() 
- Updated securechat example
- Added timeout for handshake and close_notify for better security
  - However, it's currently hard-coded.  Will make it a property later.
