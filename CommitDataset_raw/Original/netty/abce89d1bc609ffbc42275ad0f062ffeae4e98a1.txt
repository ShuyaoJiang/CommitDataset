Revert "[#5028] Fix re-entrance issue with channelWritabilityChanged(...) and write(...)"

Motivation:
Revert d0943dcd30b08eb4043aeb88fd983bcebf8c3432. Delaying the notification of writability change may lead to notification being missed. This is a ABA type of concurrency problem.

Modifications:
- Revert d0943dcd30b08eb4043aeb88fd983bcebf8c3432.

Result:
channelWritabilityChange will be called on every change, and will not be suppressed due to ABA scenario.
