Perform cross-tests between NIO and epoll transport

Motivation:

The epoll testsuite tests the epoll transport only against itself (i.e. epoll x epoll only).  We should test the epoll transport also against the well-tested NIO transport, too.

Modifications:

- Make SocketTestPermutation extensible and reusable so that the epoll testsuite can take advantage of it.
- Rename EpollTestUtils to EpollSocketTestPermutation and make it extend SocketTestPermutation.
- Overall clean-up of SocketTestPermutation
  - Use Arrays.asList() for simplicity
  - Add combo() method to remove code duplication

Result:

The epoll transport is now also tested against the NIO transport.  SocketTestPermutation got cleaner.
