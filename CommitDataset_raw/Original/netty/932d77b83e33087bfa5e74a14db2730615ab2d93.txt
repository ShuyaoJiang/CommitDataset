Verify error stack is empty after each operation when using ReferenceCountedOpenSslEngine. (#7943)

Motivation:

https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7941 proved that its easy to not correctly clear the error stack sometimes. We should do carefully test this.

Modifications:

Add a new SSLEngine wrapper that is used during tests, which verifies that the error stack is empty after each method call.

Result:

Better testing.
