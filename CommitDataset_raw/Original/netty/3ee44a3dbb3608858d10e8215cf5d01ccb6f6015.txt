Update Netty to latest netty-tcnative

Motivation:

The latest netty-tcnative fixes a bug in determining the version of the runtime openssl lib.  It also publishes an artificact with the classifier linux-<arch>-fedora for fedora-based systems.

Modifications:

Modified the build files to use the "-fedora" classifier when appropriate for tcnative. Care is taken, however, to not change the classifier for the native epoll transport.

Result:

Netty is updated the the new shiny netty-tcnative.
