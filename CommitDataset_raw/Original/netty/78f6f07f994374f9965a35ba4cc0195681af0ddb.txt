Correctly handle user home directory with spaces when construct javaagent argument

Motivation:

When the user home and so the path to the local maven repository contains spaces it currently fails to run the tests (at least on windows).

Modifications:

Put double quotes around the ${settings.localRepository}

Result:

Be able to run build and tests even when user home path has spaces in it.
