Mark initialization of unsafe as privileged

Motiviation:

Preparing platform dependent code for using unsafe requires executing
privileged code. The privileged code for initializing unsafe is executed
in a manner that would require all code leading up to the initialization
to have the requisite permissions. Yet, in a restrictive environment
(e.g., under a security policy that only grants the requisite
permissions the Netty common jar but not to application code triggering
the Netty initialization), then initializing unsafe will not succeed
even if the security policy would otherwise permit it.

Modifications:

This commit marks the necessary blocks as privileged. This enables
access to the necessary resources for initialization unsafe. The idea is
that we are saying the Netty code is trusted, and as long as the Netty
code has been granted the necessary permissions, then we will allow the
caller access to these resources even though the caller itself might not
have the requisite permissions.

Result:

Unsafe can be initialized in a restrictive security environment.
