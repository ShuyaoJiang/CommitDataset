Do not call inbound event methods directly

- Fixes #831

This commit ensures the following events are never triggered as a direct
invocation if they are triggered via ChannelPipeline.fire*():

- channelInactive
- channelUnregistered
- exceptionCaught

This commit also fixes the following issues surfaced by this fix:

- Embedded channel implementations run scheduled tasks too early
- SpdySessionHandlerTest tries to generate inbound data even after the
  channel is closed.
- AioSocketChannel enters into an infinite loop on I/O error.
