Added test for multi header, HttpObjectDecoder performance improvement for multi header, removed empty else block.

Motivation:

For multi-line headers HttpObjectDecoder uses StringBuilder.append(a).append(b) pattern that could be easily replaced with regular a + b. Also oparations with a and b moved out from concat operation to make it friendly for StringOptimizeConcat optimization and thus - faster.

Modification:

StringBuilder.append(a).append(b) reaplced with a + b. Operations with a and b moved out from concat oparation.

Result:
Code simpler to read and faster.
