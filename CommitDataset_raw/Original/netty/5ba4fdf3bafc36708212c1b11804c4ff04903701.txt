HttpObjectAggregator only set Content-Length is not already set.

Motivation:

HEAD requests will have a Content-Length set that doesn't match the
actual length. So we only want to set Content-Length header if it isn't
already set.

Modifications:

If check around setting the Content-Length.

Result:

A HEAD request will no correctly return the specified Content-Length
instead of the body length.
