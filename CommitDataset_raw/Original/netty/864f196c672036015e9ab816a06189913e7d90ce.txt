Add missing SslContextBuilder.forServer(KeyManagerFactory)

Motivation:

keyManager() is required on server-side, and so there is a forServer()
method for each override of keyManager(). However, one of the
forServer() overrides was missing, which meant that if you wanted to use
a KeyManagerFactory you were forced to provide garbage configuration
just to get past null checks.

Modifications:

Add missing override.

Result:

No hacks to use SslContextBuilder on server-side with KeyManagerFactory.
Resolves #3775
