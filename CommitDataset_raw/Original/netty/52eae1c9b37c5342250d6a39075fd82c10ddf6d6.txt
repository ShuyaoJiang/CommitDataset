Add support for mutual auth when using OpenSslEngine.

Motivation:

Currently mutual auth is not supported when using OpenSslEngine.

Modification:

- Add support to OpenSslClientContext
- Correctly throw SSLHandshakeException when an error during handshake is detected

Result:

Mutual auth can be used with OpenSslEngine
