[#4658] Fix encoding of pom.xml file

Motivation:

transport-native-epoll has its pom.xml encoding attribute set to ISO-8859-15. Because
of this gradle, and other dependency management systems, can't correctly resolve this
library from wherever it happens to be published.

Modifications:

netty/transport-native-epoll/pom.xml had its xml encoding changed to UTF-9

Result:

Gradle, and other dependency management systems, will now be able to correctly resolve this module.
