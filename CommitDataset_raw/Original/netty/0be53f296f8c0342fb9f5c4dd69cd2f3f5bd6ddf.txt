MemoryRegionCache$Entry objects are not recycled

Motivation:

Even though MemoryRegionCache$Entry instances are allocated through a recycler they are not properly recycled,
leaving a lot of instances to be GCed along with Recycler$DefaultHandle objects.
Fixes #4071

Modification:

Recycle Entry when done using it.

Result:

Less GCed objects.
