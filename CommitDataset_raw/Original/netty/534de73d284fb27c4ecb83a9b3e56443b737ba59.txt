Workaround JDK bug that will cause an AssertionError when calling ServerSocketChannel.config().getOptions(). (#8183)

Motivation:

There is a JDK bug which will return IP_TOS as supported option for ServerSocketChannel even if its not supported afterwards and cause an AssertionError.
See http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/nio-dev/2018-August/005365.html.

Modifications:

Add a workaround for the JDK bug.

Result:

ServerSocketChannel.config().getOptions() will not throw anymore and work as expected.
