Correctly handle UpgradeEvent.release(decrement).

Motivation:

We missed to pass the decrement value to the wrapped FullHttpRequest and so missed to decrement the reference count in the correct way.

Modifications:

Correctly pass the decrement value to the wrapped request.

Result:

UpgradeEvent.release(decrement) works as expected.
