Rewrite ChannelOutboundBuffer

- Merge MessageList into ChannelOutboundBuffer
- Make ChannelOutboundBuffer a queue-like data structure so that it is nearly impossible to leak a message
- Make ChannelOutboundBuffer public so that AbstractChannel can expose it to its subclasses.
- TODO: Re-enable gathering write in NioSocketChannel
