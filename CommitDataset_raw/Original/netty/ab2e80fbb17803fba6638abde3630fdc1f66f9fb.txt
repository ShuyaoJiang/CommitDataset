Add EDNS support to DnsQueryEncoder

Motivation:

DnsQueryEncoder does not encode the 'additional resources' section at all, which contains the pseudo-RR as defined in RFC 2671.

Modifications:

- Modify DnsQueryEncoder to encode the additional resources
- Fix a bug in DnsQueryEncoder where an empty name is encoded incorrectly

Result:

A user can send an EDNS query.
