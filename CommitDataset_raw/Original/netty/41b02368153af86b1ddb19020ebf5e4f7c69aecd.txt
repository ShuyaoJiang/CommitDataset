Allow to offload certificate validation when using BoringSSL (#8974)

Motivation:

BoringSSL supports offloading certificate validation to a different thread. This is useful as it may need to do blocking operations and so may block the EventLoop.

Modification:

- Adjust ReferenceCountedOpenSslEngine to correctly handle offloaded certificate validation (just as we already have code for certificate selection).

Result:

Be able to offload certificate validation when using BoringSSL.
