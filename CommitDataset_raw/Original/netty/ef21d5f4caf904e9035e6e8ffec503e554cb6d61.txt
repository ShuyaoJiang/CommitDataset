UnsafeByteBufUtil errors and simplification

Motiviation:
UnsafeByteBufUtil has some bugs related to using an incorrect index, and also omitting the array paramter when dealing with byte[] objects. There is also some simplification possible with respect to type casting, and minor formatting consistentcy issues.

Modifications:
- Ensure indexing is correct when dealing with native memory
- Fix the native access and endianness for the medium/unsigned medium methods
- Ensure array is used when dealing with heap memory
- Remove unecessary casts when using long
- Fix formating and alignment

Result:
UnsafeByteBufUtil is more correct and won't access direct memory when heap arrays are used.
