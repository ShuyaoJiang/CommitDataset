Ensure channelReadComplete() is called only when necessary

Motivation:

Even if a handler called ctx.fireChannelReadComplete(), the next handler
should not get its channelReadComplete() invoked if fireChannelRead()
was not invoked before.

Modifications:

- Ensure channelReadComplete() is invoked only when the handler of the
  current context actually produced a message, because otherwise there's
  no point of triggering channelReadComplete().
  i.e. channelReadComplete() must follow channelRead().
- Fix a bug where ctx.read() was not called if the handler of the
  current context did not produce any message, making the connection
  stall. Read the new comment for more information.

Result:

- channelReadComplete() is invoked only when it makes sense.
- No stale connection
