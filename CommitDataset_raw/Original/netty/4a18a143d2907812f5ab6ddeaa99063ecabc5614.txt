Only set lastReadTime if an read actually happened before in IdleStateHandler.

Motivation:

IdleStateHandler and ReadTimeoutHandler could mistakely not fire an event even if no channelRead(...) call happened.

Modifications:

Only set lastReadTime if a read happened before.

Result:

More correct IdleStateHandler / ReadTimeoutHandler.
