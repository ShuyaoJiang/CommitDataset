[#5648] Detect if netty-tcnative is in classpath or just tcnative

Motivation:

If netty is used in a tomcat container tomcat itself may ship tcnative. Because of this we will try to use OpenSsl in netty and fail because it is different to netty-tcnative.

Modifications:

Ensure if we find tcnative it is really netty-tcnative before using it.

Result:

No more problems when using netty in a tomcat container that also has tcnative installed.
