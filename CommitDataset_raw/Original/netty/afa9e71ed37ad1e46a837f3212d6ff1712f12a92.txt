Allow to use WebSocketClientHandshaker and WebSocketServerHandshaker with HttpResponse / HttpRequest

Motivation:

To use WebSocketClientHandshaker / WebSocketServerHandshaker it's currently a requirement of having a HttpObjectAggregator in the ChannelPipeline. This is not a big deal when a user only wants to server WebSockets but is a limitation if the server serves WebSockets and normal HTTP traffic.

Modifications:

Allow to use WebSocketClientHandshaker and WebSocketServerHandshaker without HttpObjectAggregator in the ChannelPipeline.

Result:

More flexibility
