[#3785] Correctly handle connection refused with native transport

Motivation:

Due a bug we not correctly handled connection refused errors and so failed the connect promise with the wrong exception.
Beside this we some times even triggered fireChannelActive() which is not correct.

Modifications:

- Add testcase
- correctly detect connect errors

Result:

Correct and consistent handling.
