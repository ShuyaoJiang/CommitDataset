Remove direct usage of JKS and SunX509

Motivation:

When using netty on android or with for example a IBM JVM it may not be able to build a SslContext as we hardcoded the use of JKS and SunX509 (which both may not be present).

Modifications:

- Use the default algorithm / type which can be override via a System property
- Remove System property check as its redundant with KeyManagerFactory.getDefaultAlgorithm()

Result:

More portable code. Fixes [#7546].
