Remove memory copy when checksum non heap backed ByteBuf implementations using Snappy

Motivation:

We should try to minimize memory copies whenever possible.

Modifications:

- Refactor ByteBufChecksum to work with heap and direct ByteBuf always
- Remove memory copy in Snappy by let Crc32c extend ByteBufChecksum

Result:

Less memory copies when using Snappy
