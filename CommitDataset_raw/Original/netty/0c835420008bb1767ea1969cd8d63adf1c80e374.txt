Use ChannelException when ChannelConfig operation fails in epoll.

Motivation:

In NIO and OIO we throw a ChannelException if a ChannelConfig operation fails. We should do the same with epoll to be consistent.

Modifications:

Use ChannelException

Result:

Consistent behaviour across different transport implementations.
