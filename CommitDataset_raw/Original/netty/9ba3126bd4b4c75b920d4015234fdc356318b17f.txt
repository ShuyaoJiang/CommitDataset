Add generic versions of PromiseAggregator and PromiseNotifier.

Motivation:

ChannelPromiseAggregator and ChannelPromiseNotifiers only allow
consumers to work with Channels as the result type. Generic versions
of these classes allow consumers to aggregate or broadcast the results
of an asynchronous execution with other result types.

Modifications:

Add PromiseAggregator and PromiseNotifier. Add unit tests for both.
Remove code in ChannelPromiseAggregator and ChannelPromiseNotifier and
modify them to extend the new base classes.

Result:

Consumers can now aggregate or broadcast the results of an asynchronous
execution with results types other than Channel.
