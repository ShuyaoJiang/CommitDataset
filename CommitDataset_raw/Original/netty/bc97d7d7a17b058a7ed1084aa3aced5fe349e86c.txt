Fix NPE when remote address can not be obtained

Motivation:

In the native transport we use getpeername to obtain the remote address from the file descriptor. This may fail for various reasons in which case NULL is returned.

Modifications:

- Check for null when try to obtain remote / local address

Result:

No more NPE
