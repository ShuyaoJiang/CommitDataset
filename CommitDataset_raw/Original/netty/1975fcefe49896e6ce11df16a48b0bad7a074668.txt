StringUtil cleanup. NewLine char initializing simplified and code in static section simplified.

Motivation:

NewLine initializing is complex, with unnecessary allocations and non-standard.
Static section is overloaded with StringBuilders for simple "s" + "s" concatenation pattern that compiler optimizes perfectly.

Modifications:

NewLine initializing replaced with standard System.getProperty("line.separator").
Removed StringBuilders in static section.

Result:

Less complex code.
