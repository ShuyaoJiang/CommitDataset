Motivation:

The commit mentioned above introduced a regression where
channelReadComplete() event is swallowed by a handler which was added
dynamically.

Modifications:

Do not suppress channelReadComplete() if the current handler's
channelRead() method was not invoked at all, so that a just-added
handler does not suppress channelReadComplete().

Result:

Regression is gone, and channelReadComplete() is invoked when necessary.
