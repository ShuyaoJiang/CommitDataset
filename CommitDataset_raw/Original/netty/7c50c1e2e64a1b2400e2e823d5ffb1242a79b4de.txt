Make Bootstrap and ServerBootstrap implement Cloneable and rename duplicate() to clone()

- Fixes #997
- Replace duplicate() with clone()
- Add copy constructor for simplicity
- Can now clone invalid/incomplete bootstrap
- Upgrade to netty-build-14 to disable SuperClone checkstyle module
- Finalize class hierarchy so no subclasses are introduced
