[#6015] Fix racy PooledByteBufAllocatorTests

Motivation:

We had a few tests PooledByteBufAllocatorTests which used parkNanos(...) to give a resource enough time to get destroyed. This is race and may not be good enough.

Modifications:

Ensure the ThreadCache is really destroyed.

Result:

No more racy tests that depend on ThreadCaches.
