Correctly handle errors when using OpenSSL

Motivation:

We used ERR_get_error() to detect errors and missed to handle different errors. Also we missed to clear the error queue for a thread before invoke SSL operations,
this could lead to detecting errors on different OpenSslEngines then the one in which the error actual happened.

Modifications:

Explicit handle errors via SSL.get_error and clear the error code before SSL operations.

Result:

Correctly handle errors and no false-positives in different OpenSslEngines then the one which detected an error.
