Don't calculate max direct memory twice in PlatformDependent

Motivation:

I'm not sure if trivial changes like this are interesting :-) But I
noticed that the PlatformDependent.maxDirectMemory0() method is called
twice unnecessarily during static initialization (on the default path at
least).

Modifications:

Use constant MAX_DIRECT_MEMORY already set to the same value instead of
calling maxDirectMemory0() again.

Result:

A surely imperceivable reduction in operations performed at startup.
