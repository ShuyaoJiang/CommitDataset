Make methods 'static' where it possible

Motivation:

Even if it's a super micro-optimization (most JVM could optimize such
 cases in runtime), in theory (and according to some perf tests) it
 may help a bit. It also makes a code more clear and allows you to
 access such methods in the test scope directly, without instance of
 the class.

Modifications:

Add 'static' modifier for all methods, where it possible. Mostly in
test scope.

Result:

Cleaner code with proper 'static' modifiers.
