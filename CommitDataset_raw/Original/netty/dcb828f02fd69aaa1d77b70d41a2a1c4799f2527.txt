DnsResolver CNAME redirect bug

Motviation:
DnsNameResolverContext#followCname attempts to build a query to follow a CNAME, but puts the original hostname in the DnsQuery instead of the CNAME hostname. This will result in not following CNAME redirects correctly.

Result:
- DnsNameResolverContext#followCname should use the CNAME instead of the original hostname when building the DnsQuery

Result:
More correct handling of redirect queries.
