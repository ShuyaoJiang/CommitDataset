Set thread context classloader in a doPrivileged block

Motivation:

In a few classes, Netty starts a thread and then sets the context classloader of these threads
to prevent classloader leaks. The Thread#setContextClassLoader method is a privileged method in
that it requires permissions to be executed when there is a security manager in place. Unless
these calls are wrapped in a doPrivileged block, they will fail in an environment with a security
manager and restrictive policy in place.

Modifications:

Wrap the calls to Thread#setContextClassLoader in a AccessController#doPrivileged block.

Result:

After this change, the threads can set the context classloader without any errors in an
environment with a security manager and restrictive policy in place.
