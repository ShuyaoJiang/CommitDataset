Allow HTTP decoding post CONNECT in `HttpClientCode`

__Motivation__

`HttpClientCodec` skips HTTP decoding on the connection after a successful HTTP CONNECT response is received.
 This behavior follows the spec for a client but pragmatically, if one creates a client to use a proxy transparently, the codec becomes useless after HTTP CONNECT.
 Ideally, one should be able to configure whether HTTP CONNECT should result in pass-through or not. This will enable client writers to continue using HTTP decoding even after HTTP CONNECT.

 __Modification__

 Added overloaded constructors to accept `parseHttpPostConnect`. If this parameter is `true` then the codec continues decoding even after a successful HTTP CONNECT.

 Also fixed a bug in the codec that was incrementing request count post HTTP CONNECT but not decrementing it on response. Now, the request count is only incremented if the codec is not `done`.

 __Result__

 Easier usage by HTTP client writers who wants to connect to a proxy but still decode HTTP for their users for subsequent requests.
