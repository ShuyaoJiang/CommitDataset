Added exact utf8 length estimator and exposed writeUtf8 with custom space reservation on destination buffer

Motivation:

To avoid eager allocation of the destination and to perform length prefixed encoding of UTF-8 string with forward only access pattern

Modifications:

The original writeUtf8 is modified by allowing customization of the reserved bytes on the destination buffer and is introduced an exact UTF-8 length estimator.

Result:

Is now possible to perform length first encoding with UTF-8 well-formed char sequences following a forward only write access pattern on the destination buffer.
