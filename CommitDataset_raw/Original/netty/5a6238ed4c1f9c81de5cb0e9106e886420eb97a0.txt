Minimize reference count checks in SlicedByteBuf

Motivation:

SlicedByteBuf did double reference count checking for various bulk operations, which affects performance.

Modifications:

- Add package private method to AbstractByteBuf that can be used to check indexes without check the reference count
- Use this new method in the bulk operation os SlicedByteBuf as the reference count checks take place on the wrapped buffer anyway
- Fix test-case to not try to read data that is out of the bounds of the buffer.

Result:

Better performance on bulk operations when using SlicedByteBuf (and sub-classes)
