Add IPv6 multicast test to testsuite (#9037)

Motivation:

We currently only cover ipv4 multicast in the testsuite but we should also have tests for ipv6.

Modifications:

- Add test for ipv6
- Ensure we only try to run multicast test for ipv4 / ipv6 if the loopback interface supports it.

Result:

Better test coverage
