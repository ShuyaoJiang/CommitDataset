DefaultChannelPipeline will not invoke handler if events are fired from handlerAdded

Motiviation:
DefaultChannelPipeline and AbstractChannelHandlerContext maintain state
which indicates if a ChannelHandler should be invoked or not. However
the state is updated to allow the handler to be invoked only after the
handlerAdded method completes. If the handlerAdded method generates
events which may result in other methods being invoked on that handler
they will be missed.

Modifications:
- DefaultChannelPipeline should set the state before calling
handlerAdded

Result:
DefaultChannelPipeline will allow events to be processed during the
handlerAdded process.
