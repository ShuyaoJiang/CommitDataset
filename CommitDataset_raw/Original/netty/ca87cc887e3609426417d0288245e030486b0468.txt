Simplify Bzip2 tests

Motivation:

Sometimes we have a 'build time out' error because tests for bzip2 codec take a long time.

Modifications:

Removed cycles from Bzip2EncoderTest.testCompression(byte[]) and Bzip2DecoderTest.testDecompression(byte[]).

Result:

Reduced time to test the 'codec' package by 30 percent.
