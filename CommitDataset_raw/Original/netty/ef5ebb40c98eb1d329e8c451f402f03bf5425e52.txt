Keep all leak records up to the target amount

Motivation:
When looking for a leak, its nice to be able to request at least a
number of leaks.

Modification:

* Made all leak records up to the target amoutn recorded, and only
  then enable backing off.
* Enable recording more than 32 elements.  Previously the shift
  amount made this impossible.

Result:
Ability to record all accesses.
