[#5174] Expose Bootstrap getter methods and add some additional ones

Motivation:

The Bootstrap class (applies also to AbstractBootstrap and ServerBootstrap) has a few package private getter methods and some things such as #attr() and #options() aren't exposed at all.

Modifications:

Expose "getters" for configured things in a safe-manner via the config() method.

Result:

Easier for the user to check what is configured for a Bootstrap/ServerBootstrap.
