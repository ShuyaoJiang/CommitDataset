Optimize HPACK usage to align more with Netty types and remove heavy object creations. Related to [#3597]

Motivations:

The HPACK code was not really optimized and written with Netty types in mind. Because of this a lot of garbage was created due heavy object creation.

This was first reported in [#3597] and https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/1872 .

Modifications:

- Directly use ByteBuf as input and output
- Make use of ByteProcessor where possible
- Use AsciiString as this is the only thing we need for our http2 usage

Result:

Less garbage and better usage of Netty apis.
