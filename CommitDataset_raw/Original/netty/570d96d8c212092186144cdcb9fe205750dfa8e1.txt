SslHandler leak

Motivation:
SslHandler only supports ByteBuf objects, but will not release objects of other types. SslHandler will also not release objects if its internal state is not correctly setup.

Modifications:
- Release non-ByteBuf objects in write
- Release all objects if the SslHandler queue is not setup

Result:
Less leaks in SslHandler.
