An unit test to ensure that cipher suites don't break/disappear between releases. (#8225)

Motivation

Ensure classes of cipher suites continue working between releases. Adding just a DHE check for now as it caused #8165 but this test can be expaned to other suites.

Modifications

Adding an unit test that checks for the presence of a cipher suite.

Result

Prevent #8165 from happening in the future.
