HTTP/2 DefaultHttp2HeadersDecoder weighted average error

Motiviation:
cfcee5798d6680d87aec3ae68cdded74a1402f84 introduced code to resize the headers based upon a weighted average. The weight used for new entries was initialized using integer arithmetic when it should have been floating point arithmetic and so new values contribute 0 weight.

Modifications:
- Cast to float when initializing

Result:
Weighted average does not give 0 weight to new headers in DefaultHttp2HeadersDecoder.
