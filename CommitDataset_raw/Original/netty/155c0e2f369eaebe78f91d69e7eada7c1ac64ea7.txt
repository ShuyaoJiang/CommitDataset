Implement internal memory access methods of CompositeByteBuf correctly

Motivation:

When a CompositeByteBuf is empty (i.e. has no component), its internal
memory access operations do not always behave as expected.

Modifications:

Check if the nunmber of components is zero. If so, return an empty
array or an empty NIO buffer, etc.

Result:

More robustness
