Fix HTTP/2 dependency tree corruption

Motivation:

Chrome was randomly getting stuck loading the tiles examples.
Investigation showed that the Netty flow controller thought it had
nothing to send for the connection even though some streams has queued
data and window available.

Modifications:

Fixed an accounting error where an implicitly created parent was not
being added to the dependency tree, thus it and all of its children were
orphaned from the connection's tree and would never have data written.

Result:

Fixes #6621
