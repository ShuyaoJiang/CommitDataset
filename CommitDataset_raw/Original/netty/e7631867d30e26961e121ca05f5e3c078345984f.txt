LzmaFrameEncoderTest double release

Motivation:
2c78902ebc7a81caa0ee6e3892438455f06dec9c ensured buffers were released in the general case but didn't clean up an extra release in LzmaFrameEncoderTest#testCompressionOfBatchedFlowOfData which lead to a double release.

Modifications:
LzmaFrameEncoderTest#testCompressionOfBatchedFlowOfData should not explicitly release the buffer because decompress will release the buffer

Result:
No more reference count exception and failed test.
