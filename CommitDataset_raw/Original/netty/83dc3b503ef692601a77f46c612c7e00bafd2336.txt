ByteBufInputStream is always allocating a StringBuilder instance (#8347)

Motivation:

Avoid creating any StringBuilder instance if
ByteBufInputStream::readLine isn't used

Modifications:

The StringBuilder instance is lazy allocated on demand and
are added new test case branches to address the increased
complexity of ByteBufInputStream::readLine

Result:

Reduced GC activity if ByteBufInputStream::readLine isn't used
