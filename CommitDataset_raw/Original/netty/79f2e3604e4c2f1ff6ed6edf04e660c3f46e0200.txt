HTTP/2 close only send GO_AWAY if one has not already been sent

Motivation:
Http2ConnectionHandler will always send a GO_AWAY when the channel is closed. This may cause problems if the user is attempting to control when GO_AWAY is sent and the content of the GO_AWAY.

Modifications:
- When the channel is closed Http2ConnectionHandler should only send a GO_AWAY if one has not already been sent

Result:
The user has more control over when GO_AWAY is sent
