Remove the codecs and handlers that can't make it on time for 4.0.0.A1

- Removed ones are: IP filer and HTTP multipart codec
  - Needs closer code review and polishing
  - Sorry. I'll add them back in the next alpha releases
  - SSL handler and ChunkedWriteHandler also need more work, but
    I really want to make them part of the first alpha because they
    are used pretty often by users.
