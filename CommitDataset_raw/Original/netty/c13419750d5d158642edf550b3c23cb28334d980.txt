Improve Bzip2BitReader/Writer

Motivation:

Before this changes Bzip2BitReader and Bzip2BitWriter accessed to ByteBuf byte by byte. So tests for Bzip2 compression codec takes a lot of time if we ran them with paranoid level of resource leak detection. For more information see comments to #2681 and #2689.

Modifications:

- Increased size of bit buffers from 8 to 64 bits.
- Improved reading and writing operations.
- Save link to incoming ByteBuf inside Bzip2BitReader.
- Added methods to check possible readable bits and bytes in Bzip2BitReader.
- Updated Bzip2 classes to use new API of Bzip2BitReader.
- Added new constants to Bzip2Constants.

Result:

Increased size of bit buffers and improved performance of Bzip2 compression codec (for general work by 13% and for tests with paranoid level of resource leak detection by 55%).
