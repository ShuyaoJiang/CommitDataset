Make DnsNameResolverGroup non-final and overridable

Motivation:

There's no way to override the default settings of the DnsNameResolvers
created by DnsNameResolverGroup because DnsNameResolverGroup is final.

Modifications:

- Make DnsNameResolverGroup non-final
- Add a new overridable protected method 'newResolver()' so that a user
  can override it to create an alternative DnsNameResolver instance or
  set the non-default properties

Result:

A user can configure the DnsNameResolver.
