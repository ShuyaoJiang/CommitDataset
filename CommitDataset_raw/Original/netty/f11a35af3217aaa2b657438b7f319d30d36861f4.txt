Replace DomainMappingBuilder with DomainNameMappingBuilder

Motivation:

DomainMappingBuilder should have been named as DomainNameMappingBuilder
because it builds a DomainNameMapping.

Modifications:

- Add DomainNameMappingBuilder that does the same job with
  DomainMappingBuilder
- Deprecate DomainMappingBuilder and delegate its logic to
  DomainNameMappingBuilder
- Remove the references to the deprecated methods and classes related
  with domain name mapping
- Miscellaneous:
  - Fix Javadoc of DomainNameMapping.asMap()
  - Pre-create the unmodifiable map in DomainNameMapping

Result:

- Consistent naming
- Less use of deprecated API
