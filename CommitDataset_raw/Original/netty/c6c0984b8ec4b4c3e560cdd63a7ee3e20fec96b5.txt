Ensure we always release the AddressEnvelope when doing DNS queries.

Motivation:

When we do DNS queries we need to ensure we always release the AddressEnvelope.

Modifications:

Also release the AddressEnvelope if the original resolution was done in the meantime and we did not cancel the extra query yet.

Result:

Should fix [#7713]
