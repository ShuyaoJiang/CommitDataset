Only use manual safepoint polling in PlatformDependent0.copyMemory(...) when using java <= 8 (#8124)

Motivation:

Java9 and later does the safepoint polling by itself so there is not need for us to do it.

Modifications:

Check for java version before doing manual safepoint polling.

Result:

Less custom code and less overhead when using java9 and later. Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/8122.
