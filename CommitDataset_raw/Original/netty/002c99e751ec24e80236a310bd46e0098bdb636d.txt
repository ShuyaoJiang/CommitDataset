NIO ServerChannel shouldn't close because of Exception

Motivation:
e102a008b63d0063581ba242539f0a8d473cae00 changed a conditional where previously the NIO ServerChannel would not be closed in the event of an exception.

Modifications:
- Restore the logic prior to e102a008b63d0063581ba242539f0a8d473cae00 which does not automatically close ServerChannels for IOExceptions

Result:
NIO ServerChannel doesn't close automatically for an IOException.
