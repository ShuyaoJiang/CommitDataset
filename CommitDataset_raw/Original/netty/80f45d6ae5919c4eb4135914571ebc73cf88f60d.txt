Ensure closing a Socket / FileDescriptor multiple times will not throw exception

Motivation:

If an user will close a Socket / FileDescriptor multiple times we should handle the extra close operations as NOOP.

Modifications:

Only do the actual closing one time

Result:

No exception if close is called multiple times.
