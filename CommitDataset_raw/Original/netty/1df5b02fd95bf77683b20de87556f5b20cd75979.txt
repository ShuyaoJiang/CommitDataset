Do not fire outbound exception throught the pipeline when using Http2FrameCodec / Http2MultiplexCodec

Motivation:

Usually when using netty exceptions which happen for outbound operations should not be fired through the pipeline but only the ChannelPromise should be failed.

Modifications:

- Change Http2LifecycleManager.onError(...) to take also an boolean that indicate if the error was caused by an outbound operation
- Channel Http2ConnectionHandler.on*Error(...) methods to also take this boolean
- Change Http2FrameCodec to only fire exceptions through the pipeline if these are not outbound operations related
- Add unit test.

Result:

More consistent error handling when using Http2FrameCodec and Http2MultiplexCodec.
