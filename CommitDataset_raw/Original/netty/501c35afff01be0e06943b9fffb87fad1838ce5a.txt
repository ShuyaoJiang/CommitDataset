Retain ByteBuf extras when aggregating

Motivation:

BinaryMemcacheObjectAggregator doesn't retain ByteBuf `extras`. So `io.netty.util.IllegalReferenceCountException: refCnt: 0, decrement: 1` will be thrown when aggregating a message containing `extras`. See the unit test for an example.

Modifications:

`ratain` extras to fix IllegalReferenceCountException.

Result:

`extras` is retained.
