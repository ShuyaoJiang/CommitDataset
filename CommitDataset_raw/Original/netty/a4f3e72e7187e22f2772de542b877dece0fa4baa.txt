configurable service thread name prefix

Motivation:

If netty used as part of application, should be a way to prefix service thread name to easy distinguish such threads (for example, used in IntelliJ Platform)

Modifications:

Introduce system property io.netty.serviceThreadPrefix

Result:

ThreadDeathWatcher thread has a readable name "Netty threadDeathWatcher-2-1" if io.netty.serviceThreadPrefix set to "Netty"
