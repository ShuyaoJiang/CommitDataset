[#3377] Faster overflow guard when generate nextId in EpollEventLoop

Motivation:

The current way how the guard against overflow when generating the nextId() is pretty slow once an overflow happened.

Modifications:

Once a possible overflow is detected all ids used by the EpollEventLoop are scrubed and re-assigned to the registered Channels. This way we only need to do extra work each time an overflow is detected.

Result:

More consistent performance even after the first overflow was detected.
