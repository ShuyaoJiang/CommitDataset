Avoid a double check ByteBuf#ensureWritable in ByteBufUtil

Motivation:

Methods `ByteBufUtil#writeUtf8` and `ByteBufUtil#writeAscii` contains a check `ByteBuf#ensureWritable` before the calling `ByteBuf#writeBytes`. But the `ByteBuf#writeBytes` also do a such check inside.

Modifications:

Make checks more targeted.

Result:

Less redundant method calls.
