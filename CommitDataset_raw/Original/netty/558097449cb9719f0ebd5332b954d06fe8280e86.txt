Add missed 'serialVersionUID' field for Serializable classes

Motivation:

Without a 'serialVersionUID' field, any change to a class will make
previously serialized versions unreadable.

Modifications:

Add missed 'serialVersionUID' field for all Serializable
classes.

Result:

Proper deserialization of previously serialized objects.
