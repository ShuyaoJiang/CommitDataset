[#2680] NioSocketChannelOutboundBuffer.nioBuffers() / EpollSocketChannelOutboundBuffer.memoryAddresses() should always return non-null array as stated in javadocs

Motivation:

At the moment NioSocketChannelOutboundBuffer.nioBuffers() / EpollSocketChannelOutboundBuffer.memoryAddresses() returns null if something is contained in the ChannelOutboundBuffer which is not a ByteBuf. This is a problem for two reasons:
  1 - In the javadocs we state that it will never return null
  2 - We may do a not optimal write as there may be things that could be written via gathering writes

Modifications:

Change NioSocketChannelOutboundBuffer.nioBuffers() /  EpollSocketChannelOutboundBuffer.memoryAddresses() to never return null but have it contain all ByteBuffer that were found before the non ByteBuf. This way we can do a gathering write and also conform to the javadocs.

Result:

Better speed and also correct implementation in terms of the api.
