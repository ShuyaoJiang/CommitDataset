Replaced obsolete cryptographic primitive with a modern/secure one. (#8450)

Motivation:

SHA1 is a broken hash function and shouldn't be used anymore (see: https://shattered.io/).
Security scanning tools will raise this as an issue and it will reflect badly on netty and I, therefore, recommend to use a SHA2 hash function which is secure and won't be flagged by such tools.

Modifications:

Replaced insecure SHA1 based signing scheme with SHA2.

Result:

Modern and thus secure cryptographic primitives will be in use and won't be flagged by security scanning tools.
