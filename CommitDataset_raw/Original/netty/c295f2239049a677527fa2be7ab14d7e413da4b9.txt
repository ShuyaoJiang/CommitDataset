Add junit timeout listener to print the full thread dump on test timeout

Motivation:

See #3172

Modifications:

https://github.com/netty/netty-build/pull/6 added a junit timeout listener to the netty-build project. This patch just set it up.

Result:

If a test is set the timeout parameter using junit's @Test(timeout = ...) and the timeout is triggered, a full stack trace dump will be outputted and also output the deadlocks if any.
