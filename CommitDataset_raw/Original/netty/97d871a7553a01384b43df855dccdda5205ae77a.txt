Validate cookie name and value characters Motivation:

RFC6265 specifies which characters are allowed in a cookie name and value.

Netty is currently too lax, which can used for HttpOnly escaping.

Modification:

In ServerCookieDecoder: discard cookie key-value pairs that contain invalid characters.
In ClientCookieEncoder: throw an exception when trying to encode cookies with invalid characters.

Result:

The problem described in the motivation section is fixed.
