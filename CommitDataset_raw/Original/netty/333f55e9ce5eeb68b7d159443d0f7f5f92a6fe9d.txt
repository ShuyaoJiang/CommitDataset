Add unescapeCsvFields to parse a CSV line and implement CombinedHttpHeaders.getAll

Motivation:

See #4855

Modifications:

Unfortunately, unescapeCsv cannot be used here because the input could be a CSV line like `"a,b",c`. Hence this patch adds unescapeCsvFields to parse a CSV line and split it into multiple fields and unescaped them. The unit tests should define the behavior of unescapeCsvFields.

Then this patch just uses unescapeCsvFields to implement `CombinedHttpHeaders.getAll`.

Result:

`CombinedHttpHeaders.getAll` will return the unescaped values of a header.
