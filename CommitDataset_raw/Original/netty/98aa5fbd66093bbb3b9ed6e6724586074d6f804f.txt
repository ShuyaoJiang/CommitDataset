CompositeByteBuf tidy-up (#8784)

Motivation

There's some miscellaneous cleanup/simplification of CompositeByteBuf
which would help make the code a bit clearer.

Modifications

- Simplify web of constructors and addComponents methods, reducing
duplication of logic
- Rename `Component.freeIfNecessary()` method to just `free()`, which is
less confusing (see #8641)
- Make loop in addComponents0(...) method more verbose/readable (see
https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/8437#discussion_r232124414)
- Simplify addition/subtraction in setBytes(...) methods

Result

Smaller/clearer code
