Fix Java 6 compatibility issue in DnsNameResolver

Related: #3173

Motivation:

DnsNameResolver was using InetSocketAddress.getHostString() which is
only available since Java 7.

Modifications:

Use InetSocketAddress.getHostName() in lieu of getHostString() when the
current Java version is less than 7.

Result:

DnsNameResolver runs fine on Java 6.
