Update tests to not use TestUtils.getFreePort() and so ensure we not try to use a port that is used by the system in the meantime.

Motivation:

We should not try to detect a free port in tests put just use 0 when bind so there is no race in which the system my bind something to the port we choosen before.

Modifications:

- Remove the usage of TestUtils.getFreePort() in the testsuite
- Remove hack to workaround bind errors which will not happen anymore now

Result:

Less flacky tests.
