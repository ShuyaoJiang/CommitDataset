Ensure we only call ReferenceCountUtil.safeRelease(...) in finalize() if the refCnt() > 0

Motivation:

We need to ensure we only call ReferenceCountUtil.safeRelease(...) in finalize() if the refCnt() > 0 as otherwise we will log a message about IllegalReferenceCountException.

Modification:

Check for a refCnt() > 0 before try to release

Result:

No more IllegalReferenceCountException produced when run finalize() on OpenSsl* objects that where explicit released before.
