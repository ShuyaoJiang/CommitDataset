Ensure SslHandler.sslCloseFuture() is notified in all cases.

Motivation:

The SslHandler.sslCloseFuture() may not be notified when the Channel is closed before a closify_notify is received.

Modifications:

Ensure we try to fail the sslCloseFuture() when the Channel is closed.

Result:

Correctly notify the ssl close future.
