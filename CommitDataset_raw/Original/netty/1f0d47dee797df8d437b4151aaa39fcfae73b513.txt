Added PROXY Protocol TLV support

Motivation:

The current PROXY protocol implementation does not have support for optional Type-Length-Value fields. This pull requests adds the TLV values as specified in the PROXY protocol specification (http://www.haproxy.org/download/1.5/doc/proxy-protocol.txt) and adds support for arbitrary TLVs.

Modifications:

The existing HAProxyMessage implements an additional TLV reading operation. A small bug in the AF_UNIX reader which didnâ€™t set the reader index correctly was also fixed.

Result:

The PROXY protocol supports TLVs
