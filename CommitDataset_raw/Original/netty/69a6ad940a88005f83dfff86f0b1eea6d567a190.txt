Improve the allocation algorithm in PoolChunk

Motivation:

Depth-first search is not always efficient for buddy allocation.

Modification:

Employ a new faster search algorithm with different memoryMap layout.

Result:

With thread-local cache disabled, we see a lot of performance
improvment, especially when the size of the allocation is as small as
the page size, which had the largest search space previously.
