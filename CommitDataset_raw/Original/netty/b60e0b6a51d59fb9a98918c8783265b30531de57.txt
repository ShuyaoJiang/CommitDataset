Modernize InternalLogger API and enable logging framework autodetection

- Borrow SLF4J API which is the best of the best
- InternalLoggerFactory now automatically detects the logging framework
  using static class loading. It tries SLF4J, Log4J, and then falls back
  to java.util.logging.
- Remove OsgiLogger because it is very likely that OSGi container
  already provides a bridge for existing logging frameworks
- Remove JBossLogger because the latest JBossLogger implementation seems
  to implement SLF4J binding
- Upgrade SLF4J to 1.7.2
- Remove tests for the untestable logging frameworks
- Remove TestAny
