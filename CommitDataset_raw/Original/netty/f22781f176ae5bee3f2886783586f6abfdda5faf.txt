Correctly handle hostnames with and without trailing dot in the DefaultDnsCache and use it for searchdomains. (#8181)

Motivation:

We should ensure we return the same cached entries for the hostname and hostname ending with dot. Beside this we also should use it for the searchdomains as well.

Modifications:

- Internally always use hostname with a dot as a key and so ensure we correctly handle it in the cache.
- Also query the cache for each searchdomain
- Add unit tests

Result:

Use the same cached entries for hostname with and without trailing dot. Query the cache for each searchdomain query as well
