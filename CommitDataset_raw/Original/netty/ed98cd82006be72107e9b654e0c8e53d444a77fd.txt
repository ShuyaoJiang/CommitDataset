DefaultPromise StackOverFlowException

Motivation:
When the ImmediateEventExecutor is in use it is possible to get a StackOverFlowException if when a promise completes a new listener is added to that promise.

Modifications:
- Protect against the case where LateListeners.run() smashes the stack.

Result:
Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/4395
