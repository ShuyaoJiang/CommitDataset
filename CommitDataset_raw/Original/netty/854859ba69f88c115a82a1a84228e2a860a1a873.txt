Change AggregatedFullHttpMessage to contain a content ByteBuf

Motivation:

Other implementations of FullHttpMessage allow .toString to be called after the Message has been released
This brings AggregatedFullHttpMessage into line with those impls.

Modifications:

- Changed AggregatedFullHttpMessage to no longer be a sub-class of DefaultByteBufHolder
- Changes AggregatedFullHttpMessage to implement ByteBufHolder
- Hold the content buffer internally to AggregatedFullHttpMessage
- Implement the required content() and release() methods that were missing
- Do not check refcnt when accessing content() (similar to DefaultFullHttpMessage)

Result:

A released AggregatedFullHttpMessage can have .toString called without throwing an exception
