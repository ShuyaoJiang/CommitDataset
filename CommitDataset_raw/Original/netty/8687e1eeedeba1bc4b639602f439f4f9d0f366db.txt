Don't fail the deregistration promise in Http2MultiplexCodec

Motivation:

We deviate from the AbstractChannel implementation on deregistration by
failing the provided promise if the channel is already deregistered. In
contrast, AbstractChannel will always set the promise to successfully
done.

Modification:

Change the
Http2MultiplexCodec.DefaultHttp2StreamChannel.Http2ChannelUnsafe to
always set the promise provided to deregister as done as is the
case in AbstractChannel.
