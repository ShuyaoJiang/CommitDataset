Enable per origin Cors configuration (#7800)

Motivation:

Finer granularity when configuring CorsHandler, enabling different policies for different origins.

Modifications:

The CorsHandler has an extra constructor that accepts a List<CorsConfig> that are evaluated sequentially when processing a Cors request

Result:

The changes don't break backwards compatibility. The extra ctor can be used to provide more than one CorsConfig object.
