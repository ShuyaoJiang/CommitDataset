Remove usages of deprecated methods group() and childGroup().

Motivation:

These methods were recently deprecated. However, they remained in use in several locations in Netty's codebase.

Modifications:

Netty's code will now access the bootstrap config to get the group or child group.

Result:

No impact on functionality.
