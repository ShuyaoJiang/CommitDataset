Related issue: NETTY-257 Add the getters and setters for a String and a char[] to ChannelBuffer
* Added getString() and readString()
* Renamed toString(int, int, Charset) to getString(...)
* Removed some toString() methods which were added in the previous alpha releases - I will add an alternative method later
