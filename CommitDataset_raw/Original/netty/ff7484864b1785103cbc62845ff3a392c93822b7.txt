Compare HttpMethod by reference (#8815)

Motivation:

In most cases, HttpMethod instance is built from the factory method and the same instance is taken for known Http Methods. So we can implement fast path for equals().

Modification:

Replace == checks with HttpMethod.equals;
Use this == o within HttpMethod.equals;
Replaced known new HttpMethod with HttpMethod.valueOf;
Result:

Comparisons should be a bit faster in some cases.
