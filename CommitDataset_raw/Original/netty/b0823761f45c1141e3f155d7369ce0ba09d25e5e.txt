PendingWriteQueue to handle write operations with void future

Motivation:

Right now PendingWriteQueue.removeAndWriteAll collects all promises to
PromiseCombiner instance which sets listener to each given promise throwing
IllegalStateException on VoidChannelPromise which breaks while loop
and "reports" operation as failed (when in fact part of writes might be
actually written).

Modifications:

Check if the promise is not void before adding it to the PromiseCombiner
instance.

Result:

PendingWriteQueue.removeAndWriteAll succesfully writes all pendings
even in case void promise was used.
