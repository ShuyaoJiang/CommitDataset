Allow to cache keymaterial when using OpenSSL

Motiviation:

During profiling it showed that a lot of time during the handshake is spent by parsing the key / chain over and over again. We should cache these parsed structures if possible to reduce the overhead during handshake.

Modification:

- Use new APIs provided by https://github.com/netty/netty-tcnative/pull/360.
- Introduce OpensslStaticX509KeyManagerFactory which allows to wrap another KeyManagerFactory and caches the key material provided by it.

Result:

In benchmarks handshake times have improved by 30 %.
