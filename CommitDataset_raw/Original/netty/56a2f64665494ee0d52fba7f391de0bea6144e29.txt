Clarify Future.removeListener[s] javaDocs

Motivation:
The javaDocs for Future.removeListener do not clarify that only the first occurrence of the listener is guaranteed to be removed.

Modifications:
- Clarify the javaDocs for Future.removeListener[s] so it is known that the only the first occurrence of the listener will be removed.

Result:
Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/5351
