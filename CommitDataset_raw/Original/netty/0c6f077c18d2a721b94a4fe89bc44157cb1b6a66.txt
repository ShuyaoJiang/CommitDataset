Allow to test with boringssl-static and drop into shell (#7980)

Motivation:

We also need to run our tests while using boringssl-static to ensure everything works when using it. Beside this its sometimes useful to be able to just get a shell and so interactive work in the docker instance.

Modifications:

- Add configs for shell
- Add configs for testing with boringssl-static
- Ensure we not share .m2 when running tests

Result:

More complete docker setup.
