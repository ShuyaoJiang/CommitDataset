http2: Make MAX_HEADER_LIST_SIZE exceeded a stream error when encoding.

Motivation:

The SETTINGS_MAX_HEADER_LIST_SIZE limit, as enforced by the HPACK Encoder, should be a stream error and not apply to the whole connection.

Modifications:

Made the necessary changes for the exception to be of type StreamException.

Result:

A HEADERS frame exceeding the limit, only affects a specific stream.
