Support conversion of HttpMessage and HttpContent to HTTP/2 Frames

Motivation:

HttpToHttp2ConnectionHandler only converts FullHttpMessage to HTTP/2 Frames. This does not support other use cases such as adding a HttpContentCompressor to the pipeline, which writes HttpMessage and HttpContent.

Additionally HttpToHttp2ConnectionHandler ignores converting and sending HTTP trailing headers, which is a bug as the HTTP/2 spec states that they should be sent.

Modifications:

Update HttpToHttp2ConnectionHandler to support converting HttpMessage and HttpContent to HTTP/2 Frames.
Additionally, include an extra call to writeHeaders if the message includes trailing headers

Result:

One can now write HttpMessage and HttpContent (http chunking) down the pipeline and they will be converted to HTTP/2 Frames.  If any trailing headers exist, they will be converted and sent as well.
