Remove duplicate code in ConstantPool class

Motivation:

Currently, valueOf() and newInstance() use almost same code to create new constant.
For maintainability, it's better to share duplicate code among them.

Motification:

Added new private functions.
- checkNotNullAndNotEmpty() is for checking whether the name of a constant is null and empty.
- newConstant0() is for creating a new constant.

Result:

- Compact source code
- Improvement of maintainability
