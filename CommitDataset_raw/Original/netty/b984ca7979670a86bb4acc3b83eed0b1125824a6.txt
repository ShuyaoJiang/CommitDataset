Allow to change epoll mode

Motivation:
Netty uses edge-triggered epoll by default for performance reasons. The downside here is that a messagesPerRead limit can not be enforced correctly, as we need to consume everything from the channel when notified.

Modification:
- Allow to switch epoll modes before channel is registered
- Some refactoring to share more code

Result:
It's now possible to switch epoll mode.
