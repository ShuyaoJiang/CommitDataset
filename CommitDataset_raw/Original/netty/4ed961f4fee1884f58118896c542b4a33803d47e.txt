To detect Android, check the VM property rather than the classpath

Motivation:
Some java binaries include android classes on their classpath, even
if they aren't actually android.  When this is true, `Unsafe` no
longer works, disabling the Epoll functionality.  A sample case is
for binaries that use the j2objc library.

Modifications:
Check the `java.vm.name` instead of the classpath.   Numerous
Google-internal Android libraries / binaries check this property
rather than the class path.

It is believed this is safe and works with bother ART and Dalvik
VMs, safe for Robolectric, and j2objc.

Results:
Unusually built java server binaries can still use Netty Epoll.
