Use ByteBuf#writeShort/writeMedium instead of writeBytes

Motivation:

1. Some encoders used a `ByteBuf#writeBytes` to write short constant byte array (2-3 bytes). This can be replaced with more faster `ByteBuf#writeShort` or `ByteBuf#writeMedium` which do not access the memory.
2. Two chained calls of the `ByteBuf#setByte` with constants can be replaced with one `ByteBuf#setShort` to reduce index checks.
3. The signature of method `HttpHeadersEncoder#encoderHeader` has an unnecessary `throws`.

Modifications:

1. Use `ByteBuf#writeShort` or `ByteBuf#writeMedium` instead of `ByteBuf#writeBytes` for the constants.
2. Use `ByteBuf#setShort` instead of chained call of the `ByteBuf#setByte` with constants.
3. Remove an unnecessary `throws` from `HttpHeadersEncoder#encoderHeader`.

Result:

A bit faster writes constants into buffers.
