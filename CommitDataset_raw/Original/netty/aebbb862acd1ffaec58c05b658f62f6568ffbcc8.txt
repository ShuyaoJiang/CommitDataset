Add support for ALPN when using openssl + NPN client mode and support for CipherSuiteFilter

Motivation:

To support HTTP2 we need APLN support. This was not provided before when using OpenSslEngine, so SSLEngine (JDK one) was the only bet.
Beside this CipherSuiteFilter was not supported

Modifications:

- Upgrade netty-tcnative and make use of new features to support ALPN and NPN in server and client mode.
- Guard against segfaults after the ssl pointer is freed
- support correctly different failure behaviours
- add support for CipherSuiteFilter

Result:

Be able to use OpenSslEngine for ALPN / NPN for server and client.
