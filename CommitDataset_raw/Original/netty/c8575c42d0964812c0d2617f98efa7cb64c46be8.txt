[#5976] Ensure we only consume as much data on wrap(...) as we can handle.

Motiviation:

We need to ensure we only consume as much da as we can maximal put in one ssl record to not produce a BUFFER_OVERFLOW when calling wrap(...).

Modification:

- Limit the amount of data that we consume based on the maximal plain text size that can be put in one ssl record
- Add testcase to verify the fix
- Tighten up testcases to ensure the amount of produced and consumed data in SslEngineResult matches the buffers. If not the tests will fail now.

Result:

Correct and conform behavior of OpenSslEngine.wrap(...) and better test coverage during handshaking in general.
