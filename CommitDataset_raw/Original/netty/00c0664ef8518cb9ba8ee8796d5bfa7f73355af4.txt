Avoid inaccessible object exception replacing set

Motivation:

When attempting to set the selectedKeys fields on the selector
implementation, JDK 9 can throw an inaccessible object exception.

Modications:

Catch and log this exception as an possible course of action if the
sun.nio.ch package is not exported from java.base.

Result:

The selector replacement will fail gracefully as an expected course of
action if the sun.nio.ch package is not exported from java.base.
