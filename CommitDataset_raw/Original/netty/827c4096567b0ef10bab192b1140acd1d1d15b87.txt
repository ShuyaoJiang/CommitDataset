Add uber-staging and uber-snapshot profile that can be used to generate uber all jars.

Motivation:

As we now include native code for multiple platforms we need to generate an uber all jar before release it from the staging repository. For this the uber-staging profile can be used. To create a snapshot uber jar the uber-snapshot profile can be used.

Modifications:

- Add uber-staging and uber-snapshot profile
- Correct comment in pom.xml file to show usage.

Result:

Easier to create snapshot and release uber jars.
