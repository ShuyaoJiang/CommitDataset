Fix race condition in the NonStickyEventExecutorGroup (#8232)

Motivation:

There was a race condition between the task submitter and task executor threads such that the last Runnable submitted may not get executed. 

Modifications:

The bug was fixed by checking the task queue and state in the task executor thread after it saw the task queue was empty.

Result:

Fixes #8230
