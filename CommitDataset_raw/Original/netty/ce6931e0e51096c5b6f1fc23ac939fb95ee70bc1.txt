EPOLL exception processing feedback loop

Motivation:
Commit cf171ff52555b9e984a3b9103287f6b897dc8626 changed the way read operations were done. This change introduced a feedback loop between fireException and epollInReady.

Modifications:
- All EPOLL*Channel* classes should not call fireException and also continue to read. Instead a read operation should be executed on the eventloop (if the channel's input is not closed, and other conditions are satisfied)

Result:
Exception processing and channelRead will not be in a feedback loop.
