Keep the amount of scheduled tasks for DefaultDnsCache at a minimum (#8187)

Motivation:

We are currently always remove all entries from the cache for a hostname if the lowest TTL was reached but schedule one for each of the cached entries. This is wasteful.

Modifications:

- Reimplement logic to schedule TTL to only schedule a new removal task if the requested TTL was actual lower then the one for the already scheduled task.
- Ensure we only remove from the internal map if we did not replace the Entries in the meantime.

Result:

Less overhead in terms of scheduled tasks for the DefaultDnsCache
