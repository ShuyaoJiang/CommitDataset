Remove allocation from ResourceLeakDetector

Motivation:
RLD allocates an ArrayDeque in anticipation of recording access
points.  If the leak detection level is less than ADVANCED though,
the dequeue is never used.  Since SIMPLE is the default level,
there is a minor perf win to not preemptively allocate it.

This showed up in garbage profiling when creation a high number of
buffers.

Modifications:
Only allocate the dequeue if it will be used.

Result:
Less garbage created.
