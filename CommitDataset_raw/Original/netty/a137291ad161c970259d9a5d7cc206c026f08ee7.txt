* Add OpenSslX509KeyManagerFactory which makes it even easier for people to get the maximum performance when using OpenSSL / LibreSSL / BoringSSL  with netty.

Motivation:

To make it even easier for people to get the maximum performance when using native SSL we should provide our own KeyManagerFactory implementation that people can just use to configure their key material.

Modifications:

- Add OpenSslX509KeyManagerFactory which users can use for maximum performance with native SSL
- Refactor some internal code to re-use logic and not duplicate it.

Result:

Easier to get the max performance out of native SSL implementation.
