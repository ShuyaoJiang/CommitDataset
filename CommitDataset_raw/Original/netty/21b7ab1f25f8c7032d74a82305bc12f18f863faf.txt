Allows IP_TRANSPARENT to be set on a redirecting socket

Motivation:

IP_TRANSPARENT support is not complete, the option can currently only be set on EpollServerSocket. Setting the option on an EpollSocket is also requires so as to be able to bind a socket to a non-local address as described in ip(7)
http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/ip.7.html

"TProxy redirection with the iptables TPROXY target also
requires that this option be set on the redirected socket."

Modifications:

Added IP_TRANSPARENT socket option to EpollSocketChannelConfig

Result:

A redirecting socket can be created with a non-local IP address as required for TPROXY
