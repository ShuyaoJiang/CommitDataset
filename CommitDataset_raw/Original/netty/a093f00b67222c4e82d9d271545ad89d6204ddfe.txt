Cipher suite conversion between Java and OpenSSL

Related: #3285

Motivation:

When a user attempts to switch from JdkSslContext to OpenSslContext, he
or she will see the initialization failure if he or she specified custom
cipher suites.

Modifications:

- Provide a utility class that converts between Java cipher suite string
  and OpenSSL cipher suite string
- Attempt to convert the cipher suite so that a user can use the cipher
  suite string format of Java regardless of the chosen SslContext impl

Result:

- It is possible to convert all known cipher suite strings.
- It is possible to switch from JdkSslContext and OpenSslContext and
  vice versa without any configuration changes
