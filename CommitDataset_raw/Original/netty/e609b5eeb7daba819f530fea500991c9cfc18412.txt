Close consumed inputs in ChunkedWriteHandler (#8876)

Motivation:

ChunkedWriteHandler needs to close both successful and failed
ChunkInputs. It used to never close successful ones.

Modifications:

* ChunkedWriteHandler always closes ChunkInput before completing
the write promise. 
* Ensure only ChunkInput#close() is invoked
on a failed input.
* Ensure no methods are invoked on a closed input.

Result:

Fixes https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/8875.
