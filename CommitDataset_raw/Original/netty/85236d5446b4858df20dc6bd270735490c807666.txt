[#4355] OpenSslServerContext reinitializes the provided TrustManagerFactory with the key cert chain.

Motivation:

OpenSslServerContext should not reinitialize the provided TrustManagerFactory with the key cert chain as the user should be able to pass a fully initialized TrustManagerFactory. This is also in line with how JdkSslServerContext works.

Modifications:

Not reinitialize the provided TrustManagerFactory with the key cert chain.

Result:

Correct and consistent behavior.
