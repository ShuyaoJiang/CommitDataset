Http/2 Priority on CLOSED stream

Motivation:
The encoder/decoder currently do not handle streams which have previously existed but no longer exist because they were closed. The specification requires supporting this.

Modifications:
- encoder/decoder should tolerate the frame or the dependent frame not existing in the streams map due to the fact that it may have previously existed.

Result:
encoder/decoder are more compliant with the specification.
