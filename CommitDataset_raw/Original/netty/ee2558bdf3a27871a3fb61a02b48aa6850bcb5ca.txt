[#4722] Ensure the whole certificate chain is used when creating SslContext for client mode and SslProvider.OPENSSL is used

Motivation:

We incorrectly added the trustCertChain as certificate chain when OpenSslClientContext was created. We need to correctly add the keyCertChain.

Modifications:

Correctly add whole keyCertChain.

Result:

SSL client auth is working when usin OpenSslClientContext and more then one cert is contained in the certificate chain.
