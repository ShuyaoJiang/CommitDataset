Expose SSL_CTX and SSL pointers

Motivation:

For advanced use-cases it an be helpful to be able to directly access the SSL_CTX and SSL pointers of the underlying openssl objects. This for example allows to register custom C callbacks.

Modifications:

- Expose the SSL_CTX and SSL pointers
- Cleanup the shutdown code

Result:

It's now possible to obtain the c pointes and set native callbacks.
