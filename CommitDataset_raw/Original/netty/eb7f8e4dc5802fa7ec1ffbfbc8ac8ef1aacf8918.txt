Expose RoundRobinInetAddressResolver

Motivation:
Make small refactoring for recently merged PR #5867 to make the code more flexible and expose aggressive round robin as a NameResolver too with proper code reuse.

Modifications:
Round robin is a method of hostname resolving - so Round robin related code fully moved to RoundRobinInetAddressResolver implements NameResolver<InetAddress>, RoundRobinInetSocketAddressResolver is deleted as a separate class, instance with the same functionality could be created by calling #asAddressResolver.

Result:
New forced Round Robin code exposed not only as an AddressResolver but as a NameResolver too, more proper code and semantic reusing of InetNameResolver and InetSocketAddressResolver classes.
