NativeLibraryLoader should check the result of ClassLoader#getResource method

Motivation:

NativeLibraryLoader uses ClassLoader#getResource method that can return nulls when the resource cannot be found. The returned url variable should be checked for nullity and fail in a more usable manner than a NullPointerException

Modifications:

Fail with a FileNotFoundException

Result:

Fixes [#7222].
