Have hosts file support for DnsNameResolver, close #4074

Motivation:

On contrary to `DefaultNameResolver`, `DnsNameResolver` doesn't currently honor hosts file.

Modifications:

* Introduce `HostsFileParser` that parses `/etc/hosts` or `C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts` depending on the platform
* Introduce `HostsFileEntriesResolver` that uses the former to resolve host names
* Make `DnsNameResolver` check his `HostsFileEntriesResolver` prior to trying to resolve names against the DNS server
* Introduce `DnsNameResolverBuilder` so we now have a builder for `DnsNameResolver`s
* Additionally introduce a `CompositeNameResolver` that takes several `NameResolver`s and tries to resolve names by delegating sequentially
* Change `DnsNameResolver.asAddressResolver` to return a composite and honor hosts file

Result:

Hosts file support when using `DnsNameResolver`.
Consistent behavior with JDK implementation.
