[#5861] HttpUtil.getContentLength(HttpMessage, long) throws unexpected NumberFormatException

Motivation:

The Javadocs of HttpUtil.getContentLength(HttpMessage, long) and its int overload state that the provided default value is returned if the Content-Length value is not a number. NumberFormatException is thrown instead.

Modifications:

Correctly handle when the value is not a number.

Result:

API works as stated in javadocs.
