Correctly include the stream id when convert from Http2HeadersFrame to HttpMessage

Motivation:

We did not correctly set the stream id in the headers of HttpMessage when converting a Http2HeadersFrame. This is based on https://github.com/netty/netty/pull/7778 so thanks to @jprante.

Modifications:

- Correctly set the id when possible in the header.
- Add test case

Result:

Correctly include stream id.
