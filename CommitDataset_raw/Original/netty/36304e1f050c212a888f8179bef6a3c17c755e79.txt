Reduce object allocation by using same ChannelFutureListener instance.

Motivation:

When VoidChannelPromise.unvoid() was called we created a new ChannelFutureListener everytime. This is not needed as its stateless.

Modifications:

Reuse the ChannelFutureListener.

Result:

Less object allocations
