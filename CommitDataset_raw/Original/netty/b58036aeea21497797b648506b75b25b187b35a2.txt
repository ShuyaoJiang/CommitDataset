Improve flexibility of EmbeddedChannel ID

Motivation:

EmbeddedChannelId#hashCode() and equals() do not behave correctly if an
instance is serialized and then deserialized. Additionally,
EmbeddedChannel does not allow use of any other type of ChannelId, and
EmbeddedChannelId is (mostly) a singleton instance. This creates a
problem for unit tests that construct multiple EmbeddedChannels and
expect each channel to have a unique ID.

Modifications:

EmbeddedChannelId is modified so equals() will return true and
hashCode() will return the same value for any instance of the class.
EmbeddedChannel is modified to allow a ChannelId to be specified when
the channel is constructed. Tests added for both changes.

Result:

EmbeddedChannelId now behaves correctly when deserialized, and
EmbeddedChannels can now have unique IDs.
