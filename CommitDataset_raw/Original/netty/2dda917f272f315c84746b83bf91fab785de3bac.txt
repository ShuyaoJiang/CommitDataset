Http2DefaultFrameWriter microbenchmark

Motivation:
A microbenchmark will be useful to get a baseline for performance.

Modifications:
- Introduce a new microbenchmark which tests the Http2DefaultFrameWriter.
- Allow benchmarks to run without thread context switching between JMH and Netty.

Result:
Microbenchmark exists to test performance.
