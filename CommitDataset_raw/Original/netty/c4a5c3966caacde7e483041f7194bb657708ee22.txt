Headers remove infrequently used member variables

Motivation:
There are two member variables (addAllVisitor, setAllVisitor) which are likely not to be used in the majority of use cases.

Modifications:
Remove these member variables and rely on a method to return a new object when needed.

Result:
Two less member variables for each DefaultHeaders instance.
