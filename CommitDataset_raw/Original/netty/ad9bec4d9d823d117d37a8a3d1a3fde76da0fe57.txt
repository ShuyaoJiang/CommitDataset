Add support for splice(...)

Motivation:

Linux supports splice(...) to transfer data from one filedescriptor to another without
pass data through the user-space. This allows to write high-performant proxy code or to stream
stuff from the socket directly the the filesystem.

Modification:

Add AbstractEpollStreamChannel.spliceTo(...) method to support splice(...) system call

Result:

Splice is now supported when using the native linux transport.
