Additional configuration for leak detection

Motivation:

Leak detector, when it detects a leak, will print the last 5 stack
traces that touched the ByteBuf. In some cases that might not be enough
to identify the root cause of the leak.
Also, sometimes users might not be interested in tracing all the
operations on the buffer, but just the ones that are affecting the
reference count.

Modifications:

Added command line properties to override default values:
 * Allow to configure max number of stack traces to collect
 * Allow to only record retain/release operation on buffers

Result:
Users can increase the number of stack traces to debug buffer leaks
with lot of retain/release operations.
