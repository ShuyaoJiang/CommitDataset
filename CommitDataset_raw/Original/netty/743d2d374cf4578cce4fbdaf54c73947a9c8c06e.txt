SslHandler benchmark and SslEngine multiple packets benchmark

Motivation:
We currently don't have a benchmark which includes SslHandler. The SslEngine benchmarks also always include a single TLS packet when encoding/decoding. In practice when reading data from the network there may be multiple TLS packets present and we should expand the benchmarks to understand this use case.

Modifications:
- SslEngine benchmarks should include wrapping/unwrapping of multiple TLS packets
- Introduce SslHandler benchmarks which can also account for wrapping/unwrapping of multiple TLS packets

Result:
SslHandler and SslEngine benchmarks are more comprehensive.
