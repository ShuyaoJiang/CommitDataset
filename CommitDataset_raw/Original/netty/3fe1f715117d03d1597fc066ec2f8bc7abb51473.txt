Do not treat errors as decoder exception (redux)

Motivation: Today when Netty encounters a general error while decoding
it treats this as a decoder exception. However, for fatal causes this
should not be treated as such, instead the fatal error should be carried
up the stack without the callee having to unwind causes. This was
probably done for byte to byte message decoder but is now done for all
decoders.

Modifications: Instead of translating any error to a decoder exception,
we let those unwind out the stack (note that finally blocks still
execute) except in places where an event needs to fire where we fire
with the error instead of wrapping in a decoder exception.

Result: Fatal errors will not be treated as innocent decoder exceptions.
