cleanup from 819b26b

Motivation:
I cherry-picked 819b26b too soon. There were entries added to a deprecated class which should only go into the non-deprecated version of the class.

Modifications:
- Remove the static final variables that were added as duplicates to the deprecated class

Result:
Deprecated code does not grown in volume without need.
