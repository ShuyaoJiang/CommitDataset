Fixed NETTY-130 (Chunked encoding emulation for a large non-chunked HTTP request)
* Replaced mergeChunks option with maxChunkSize
* if maxChunkSize is greater than 0 and any content or chunk larger than maxChunkSize is received, it's split into multiple chunks as if a chunked request is received.
* Added unfold option to FrameDecoder and ReplayingDecoder
