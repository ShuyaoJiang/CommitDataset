Add support for Unix Domain Sockets when using native epoll transport

Motivation:

Using Unix Domain Sockets can be very useful when communication should take place on the same host and has less overhead then using loopback. We should support this with the native epoll transport.

Modifications:

- Add support for Unix Domain Sockets.
- Adjust testsuite to be able to reuse tests.

Result:

Unix Domain Sockets are now support when using native epoll transport.
