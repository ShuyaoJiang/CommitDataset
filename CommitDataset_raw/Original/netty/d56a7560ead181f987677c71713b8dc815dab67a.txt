Netty force encodes already encoded responses

Motivation:

Fix the regression recently introduced that causes already encoded responses to be encoded again as gzip

Modification:

instead of just looking for IDENTITY, anything set for Content-Encoding should be respected and left as-is

added unit tests to capture this use case

Result:

Fixes #6784
