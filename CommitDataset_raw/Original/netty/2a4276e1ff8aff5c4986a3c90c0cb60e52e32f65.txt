SpdyHttpHeaders are not lowercase

Motivation:
According to the SPDY spec https://www.chromium.org/spdy/spdy-protocol/spdy-protocol-draft3-1#TOC-3.2.1-Request header names must be lowercase. Our predefined SPDY extension headers are not lowercase.

Modifications
- SpdyHttpHeaders should define header names in lower case

Result:
Compliant with SPDY spec, and header validation code does not detect errors for our own header names.
