HashWheelTimerTest cleanup

Motivation:
HashWheelTimerTest has busy/wait and sleep statements which are not necessary. We also depend upon a com.google.common.base.Supplier which isn't necessary.

Modifications:
- Remove buys wait loops and timeouts where possible

Result:
HashWheelTimerTest more explicit in verifying conditions and less reliant on wait times.
