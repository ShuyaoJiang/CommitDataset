Remove Frame class from DefaultHttp2RemoteFlowController. Fixes #3488

Motivation:

For every write of a flow controlled frame (HEADERS, DATA) we are allocating
a Frame object that is not necessary anymore as it does not maintain any
state, besides the payload.

Modifications:

Remove the Frame class and directly add the payload to the pending write queue.

Result:

One few object allocation per write of a flow controlled frame.
