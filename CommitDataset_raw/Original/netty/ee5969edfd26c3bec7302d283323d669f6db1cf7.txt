Use higher maxQueriesPerResolve and make exception message more clear.

Motivation:

We use a default of 3 for maxQueriesPerResolve when using the DnsNameResolverBuilder, which is too low if you want to resolve a hostname that uses a lot of CNAME records.

Modifications:

- Use higher default (16)
- Make exception message more clear why it failed.

Result:

Be able to resolve more domains by default and be able to better trouble shoot why a resolver failed.
