Http2ConnectionHandler.BaseBuilder exception cleanup

Motivation:
Http2ConnectionHandler.BaseBuilder is constructing objects which have 'close' methods, but is not calling these methods in the event of an exception.

Modifications:
- Objects which implement 'close' should have this method called if an exception is thrown and the build operation can not complete normally.

Result:
Objects are closed even if the build process encounters an error.
