Handle pre-6.x time fields (#34373)

In ccb9ab5717d85c6786b081f197d67ac7dde4d317 we changed how we deal with time
fields to support the `DateTime`-format fields added in 6.0, but dropped
support for pre-6.x `Long`-format fields. This change reinstates this support
for cases where pre-6.x data is made available to ML (e.g. in a mixed-version
CCS setup or after an upgrade).
