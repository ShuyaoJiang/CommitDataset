Never return null from Strings.tokenizeToStringArray (#28224)

This method has a different contract than all the other methods in this class, returning null instead of an empty array when receiving a null input. While switching over some methods from delimitedListToStringArray to this method tokenizeToStringArray, this resulted in unexpected nulls in some places of our code.
