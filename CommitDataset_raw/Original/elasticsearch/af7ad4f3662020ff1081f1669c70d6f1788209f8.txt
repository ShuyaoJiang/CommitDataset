[TEST][Monitoring] Move payload = null above call (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4053)

This moves the `payload = null;` statement to above the asynchronous
HTTP call. This helps to avoid a race condition relative to `doClose`
asserting that it is `null`.

This is only a realistic situation during a shutdown situation because
the thread responds immediately before it can be nullified and freeable,
which is not a realistic scenario in any other situation.
