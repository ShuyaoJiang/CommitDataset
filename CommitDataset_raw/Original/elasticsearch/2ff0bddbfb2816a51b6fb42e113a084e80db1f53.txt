Use TAR instead of DOCKER build type before 6.7.0 (#40723)

In 6.7.0 (#39378) we added a build type of DOCKER for the docker images, but
unfortunately earlier versions do not understand this and will reject any
transport messages that mention this build type.

This commit fixes this by reporting TAR instead of DOCKER when talking to older
nodes.
