[ML] Add an ingest pipeline definition to structure finder (#34350)

The ingest pipeline that is produced is very simple.  It
contains a grok processor if the format is semi-structured
text, a date processor if the format contains a timestamp,
and a remove processor if required to remove the interim
timestamp field parsed out of semi-structured text.

Eventually the UI should offer the option to customize the
pipeline with additional processors to perform other data
preparation steps before ingesting data to an index.
