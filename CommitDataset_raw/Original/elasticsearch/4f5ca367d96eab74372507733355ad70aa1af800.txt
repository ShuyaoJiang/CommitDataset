Remove the index type from internal watcher indexes (#39761)

This commit removes the "doc" type from watcher internal indexes.
The template still carries the "_doc" type since that is needed for
the internal representation.

This impacts the .watches, .triggered-watches, and .watch-history indexes.

External consumers do not need any changes since all external calls
go through the _watcher API, and should not interact with the the .index directly.

Relates #38637
