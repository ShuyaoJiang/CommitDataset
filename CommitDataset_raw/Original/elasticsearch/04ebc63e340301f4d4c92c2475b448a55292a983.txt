 RoutingMissingException in more like this (#33974)

More like this query allows to provide identifiers of documents to be retrieved as like/unlike items. 
It can happen that at retrieval time an error is thrown, for instance caused by missing routing value when `_routing` is set required in the mapping. 
Instead of ignoring such error and returning no documents for the query, the error should be re-thrown and returned to users. As part of this 
change also mget and mtermvectors are unified in the way they throw such exception like it happens in other places, so that a `RoutingMissingException` is raised.

Closes #29678
