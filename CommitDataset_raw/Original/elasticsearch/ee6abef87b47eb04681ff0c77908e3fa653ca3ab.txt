Avoid setting connection request timeout (#30384)

We've been setting this value to 500ms in the default low-level REST
client configuration, misunderstanding the effect that it would have.
This proved very problematic, as it ends up causing `TimeoutException`
returned from the leased pool in some cases even for successful requests.

Closes #24069
