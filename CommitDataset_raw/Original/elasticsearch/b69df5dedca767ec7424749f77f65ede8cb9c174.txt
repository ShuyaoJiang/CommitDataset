Change ShardFollowTask to reuse common serialization logic (#39094)

Initially in #38910, ShardFollowTask was reusing ImmutableFollowParameters'
serialization logic. After merging, bwc tests failed sometimes and
the binary serialization that ShardFollowTask was originally was using
was added back. ImmutableFollowParameters is using optional fields (optional vint)
while ShardFollowTask was not (vint).
