Fix starting on Windows from another drive (#29086)

The cd command on Windows has an oddity regarding changing
directories. If the drive of the current directory is a different drive
than than of the directory that was passed to the cd command, cd acts in
query mode and does not change the current directory. Instead, a flag is
needed to put the cd command into set mode so that the directory
actually changes. This causes a problem when starting Elasticsearch from
a directory different than the one where it is installed and this commit
fixes the issue.
