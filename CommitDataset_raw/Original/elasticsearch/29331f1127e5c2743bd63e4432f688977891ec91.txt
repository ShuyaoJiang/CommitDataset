Fail queries with scroll that explicitely set request_cache (#27342)

Queries that create a scroll context cannot use the cache.
They modify the search context during their execution so using the cache
can lead to duplicate result for the next scroll query.

This change fails the entire request if the request_cache option is explictely set
on a query that creates a scroll context (`scroll=1m`) and make sure internally that we never
use the cache for these queries when the option is not explicitely used.
For 6.x a deprecation log will be printed instead of failing the entire request and the request_cache hint
will be ignored (forced to false).
