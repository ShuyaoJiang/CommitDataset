SQL: Fix deserialisation issue of TimeProcessor (#40776)

TimeProcessor didn't implement `getWriteableName()` so the one from
the parent was used which returned the `NAME` of the parent. This
caused `TimeProcessor` objects to be deserialised into
DateTimeProcessor.

Moreover, added a restriction to run the TIME related integration tests
only in UTC timezone.

Fixes: #40717
