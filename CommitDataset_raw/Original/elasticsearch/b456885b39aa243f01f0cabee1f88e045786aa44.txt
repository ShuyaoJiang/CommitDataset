Test: increase time to wait for tribe tests with security

There have been some failures in CI due to the tribe tests with security taking too long for the
cluster to form and the expected number of node to join. In the thread dumps of the failure, it
can be seen that a node is still initializing and is in a method that could take a decent amount
of time on slow machines (TokenService#computeSecretKey). This commit increases the wait time to
allow for the node to startup and join.
