Clean codebase from empty statements (#37822)

* Remove empty statements

There are a couple of instances of undocumented empty statements all across the
code base. While they are mostly harmless, they make the code hard to read and
are potentially error-prone. Removing most of these instances and marking blocks
that look empty by intention as such.

* Change test, slightly more verbose but less confusing
