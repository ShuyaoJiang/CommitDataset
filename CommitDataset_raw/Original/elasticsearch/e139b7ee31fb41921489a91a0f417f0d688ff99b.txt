Do not allow registering basic licenses (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4087)

This is related to elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3877. This commit introduces validation that blocks
a user from registering a new basic license. Instead, the user should
use the /start_basic route to install a basic license.
