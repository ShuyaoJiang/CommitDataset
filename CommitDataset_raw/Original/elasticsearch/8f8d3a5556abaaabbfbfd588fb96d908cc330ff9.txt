[Rollup] Return empty response when aggs are missing (#32796)

If a search request doesn't contain aggs (or an empty agg object),
we should just retun an empty response.  This is how the normal search
API works if you specify zero hits and empty aggs.

The existing behavior throws an exception because it tries to send
an empty msearch.

Closes #32256
