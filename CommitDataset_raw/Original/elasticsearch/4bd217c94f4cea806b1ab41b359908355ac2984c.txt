Add pluggable XContentBuilder writers and human readable writers (#29120)

* Add pluggable XContentBuilder writers and human readable writers

This adds the ability to use SPI to plug in writers for XContentBuilder. By
implementing the XContentBuilderProvider class we can allow Elasticsearch to
plug in different ways to encode types to JSON.

Important caveat for this, we should always try to have the class implement
`ToXContentFragment` first, however, in the case of classes from our
dependencies (think Joda classes or Lucene classes) we need a way to specify
writers for these classes.

This also makes the human-readable field writers generic and pluggable, so that
we no longer need to tie XContentBuilder to things like `TimeValue` and
`ByteSizeValue`. Contained as part of this moves all the TimeValue human
readable fields to the new `humanReadableField` method. A future commit will
move the `ByteSizeValue` calls over to this method.
