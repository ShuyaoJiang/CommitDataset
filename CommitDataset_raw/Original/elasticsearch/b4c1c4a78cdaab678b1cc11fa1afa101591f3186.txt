REST high-level client: remove index suffix from indices client method names (#28263)

Today, the way to call them API under the indices namespace is by doing e.g. `client.indices().createIndex()`. Our spec define the API under the indices namespace as e.g. `indices.create`, hence there is no need to repeat the index suffix for each method as that is already defined by the namespace. Using the `index` suffix in each method was an oversight which must be corrected.
