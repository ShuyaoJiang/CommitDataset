Profiler: Don’t profile NEXTDOC for ConstantScoreQuery. (#33196)

* Profiler: Don’t profile NEXTDOC for ConstantScoreQuery.

A ConstantScore query will return the iterator of its inner query.
However, when profiling, the constant score query is wrapped separately
from its inner query, which distorts the times emitted by the profiler.
Return the iterator directly in such a case.

Closes #23430
