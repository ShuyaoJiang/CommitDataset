Painless: Add spi jar that will be published for extending whitelists (#28302)

In order to build a plugin that extends the painless whitelist, the spi
classes must be available to the plugin at compile time. This commit
moves the spi classes into a separate jar which will be published. Any
plugin authors whiching to extend painless through spi would then add a
compileOnly dependency on this jar.
