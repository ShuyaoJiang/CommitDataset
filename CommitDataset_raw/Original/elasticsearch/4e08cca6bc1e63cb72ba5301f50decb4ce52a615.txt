Ground work to start up the docker image in the build (#37754)

This change adds a docker compose configuration that's used with
the `elasticsearch.test.fixtures` plugin to start up the image
and check that the TCP ports are up.

We can build on this to add other checks for culster health,
run REST tests, etc.

We can add multiple containers and configurations to the compose
file (e.x. test different env vars) and form clusters.
