Watcher: Create two index ugprade checks for watcher upgrade (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2298)

As there are two indices to upgrade for watcher, it makes a lot of sense
to also have two upgrade checks.

There is one upgrader for the watches index, which deletes
old templates, adds the new one before and then does the reindexing.
Same for the triggered watches index.

This also means, that there will be two entries popping up in the kibana
UI.

Note: Each upgrade check checks if the other index (for the .watches
upgrade check the triggered watches index and vice versa) is already
upgraded and only if that is true, watcher is restarted.
