[TEST] Pass a clientSSLContext in LdapTestCase

If we don't explicitly sett the client SSLSocketFactory when
creating an InMemoryDirectoryServer and setting its SSL config, it
will result in using a TrustAllTrustManager(that extends
X509TrustManager) which is not allowed in a FIPS 140 JVM.
Instead, we get the SSLSocketFactory from the existing SSLContext
and pass that to be used.

Resolves #37013
