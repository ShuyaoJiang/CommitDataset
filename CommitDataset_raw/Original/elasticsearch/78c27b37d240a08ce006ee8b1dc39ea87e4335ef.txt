fix index refresh in test within 20_mix_typeless_typeful (#39198)

the test "Implicitly create a typeless ... typed template"
fails occasionally because the index operation hasn't
propogated to update the index mapping in time for the
following assertion about a dynamically mapped field "bar".

error failed with:

```
field [test-1.mappings.my_type.properties.bar] doesn't have a true value
Expected: not null
     but: was null
```

refreshing the index should resolve this timing issue.
