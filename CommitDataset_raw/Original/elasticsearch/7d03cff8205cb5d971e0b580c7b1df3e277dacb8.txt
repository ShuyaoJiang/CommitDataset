Scripting: Make ScriptEngine.compile generic on the script context (#24873)

This commit changes the compile method of ScriptEngine to be generic in
the same way it is on ScriptService. This moves the shim of handling the
two existing context classes into each script engine, so that each
engine can be worked on independently to convert to real handling of
contexts.
