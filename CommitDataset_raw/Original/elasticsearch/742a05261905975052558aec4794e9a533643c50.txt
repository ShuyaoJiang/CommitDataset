[ML] Account for the possibility of C++ log messages being UTF-16 (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2952)

On Windows, log4cxx always writes to stderr in UTF-16, and we get the
logs from C++ to Java by redirecting stderr to our named pipe.  Hence
the log handler in Java needs to tolerate the log stream it's reading
being either UTF-16 (for Windows) or UTF-8 (for other platforms).

Fixes elastic/machine-learning-cpp#385
