Remove script access to term statistics (#19462)

In scripts (at least some of the languages), the terms dictionary and
postings can be access with the special _index variable. This is for
very advanced use cases which want to do their own scoring. The problem
is segment level statistics must be recomputed for every document.
Additionally, this is not friendly to the terms index caching as the
order of looking up terms should be controlled by lucene.

This change removes _index from scripts. Anyone using it can and should
instead write a Similarity plugin, which is explicitly designed to allow
doing the calculations needed for a relevance score.

closes #19359
