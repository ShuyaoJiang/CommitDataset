[ML] Add ML result classes to protocol library (#32587)

This commit adds the ML results classes to the X-Pack protocol
library used by the high level REST client.

(Other commits will add the config classes and stats classes.)

These classes:

- Are publically immutable
- Are privately mutable - this is perhaps not as nice as the
  config classes, but to do otherwise would require adding
  builders and the corresponding server-side classes that the
  old transport client used don't have builders
- Have little/no validation of field values beyond null checks
- Are convertible to and from X-Content, but NOT wire transportable
- Have lenient parsers to maximize compatibility across versions
- Have the same class names and getter names as the corresponding
  classes in X-Pack core to ease migration for transport client
  users
- Don't reproduce all the methods that do calculations or
  transformations that the the corresponding classes in X-Pack core
  have
