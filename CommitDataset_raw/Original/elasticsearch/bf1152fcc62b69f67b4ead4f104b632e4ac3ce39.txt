Use follower primary term when applying operations (#31113)

The primary shard copy on the following has authority of the replication
operations that occur on the following side in cross-cluster
replication. Yet today we are using the primary term directly from the
operations on the leader side. Instead we should be replacing the
primary term on the following side with the primary term of the primary
on the following side. This commit does this by copying the translog
operations with the corrected primary term. This ensures that we use
this primary term while applying the operations on the primary, and when
replicating them across to the replica (where the replica request was
carrying the primary term of the primary shard copy on the follower).
