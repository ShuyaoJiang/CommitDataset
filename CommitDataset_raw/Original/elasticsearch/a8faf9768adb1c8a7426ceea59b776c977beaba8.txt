Limit the scope of BouncyCastle dependency (#30358)

Limits the scope of the runtime dependency on
BouncyCastle so that it can be eventually removed.

* Splits functionality related to reading and generating certificates
and keys in two utility classes so that reading certificates and
keys doesn't require BouncyCastle.
* Implements a class for parsing PEM Encoded key material (which also
adds support for reading PKCS8 encoded encrypted private keys).
* Removes BouncyCastle dependency for all of our test suites(except
for the tests that explicitly test certificate generation) by using
pre-generated keys/certificates/keystores.
