Move x-pack-core to core package (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3678)

This commit moves the source file in x-pack-core to a org.elasticsearch.xpack.core package. This is to prevent issues where we have compile-time success reaching through packages that will cross module boundaries at runtime (due to being in different classloaders). By moving these to a separate package, we have compile-time safety. Follow-ups can consider build time checking that only this package is defined in x-pack-core, or sealing x-pack-core until modules arrive for us.
