Cleanup GrokProcessorGetAction class (#39567)

* Removed request builder. From 7.0, request builders are no longer used.
* Use RestStatusToXContentListener instead of custom RestBuilderListener in the rest action.
* Changed a few public constructor's and constants' visibility from public to package protected.
  (these are only used internally, so no need to for public visibility)
