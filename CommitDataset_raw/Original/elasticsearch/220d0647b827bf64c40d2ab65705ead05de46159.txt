[ML] Specify ML_ORIGIN when batch scrolling results (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3125)

This change applies the same pattern that was applied in elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3054 to the
ML batched results iterators, which are used to scroll through ML results
during some internal ML implementation details, such as renormalization
and nightly maintenance.

Additionally the thread context is reset before submitting the results
processor to a thread pool, to avoid masking the problem in situations
where the user opening the job coincidentally had workable permissions.

Fixes elastic/machine-learning-cpp#438
