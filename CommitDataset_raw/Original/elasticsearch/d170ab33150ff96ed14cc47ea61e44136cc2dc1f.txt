Disable C2 from using AVX-512 on JDK 10 (#32138)

The C2 compiler in JDK 10 appears to have an issue compiling to AVX-512
instructions (on hardware that supports such). As a workaround, this
commit adds a JVM flag on JDK 10+ to disable the use of AVX-512
instructions until a fix is introduced to the JDK. Instead, we use a
flag to enable AVX and AVX2 only.

Note: Based on my reading of the C2 code, this flag does not appear to
have any impact on hardware that does not support AVX2. I have tested
this manually on an Intel Atom C2538 processor that supports neither AVX
nor AVX2. I have also tested this manually on an Intel i5-3317U
processor that supports AVX but not AVX2.
