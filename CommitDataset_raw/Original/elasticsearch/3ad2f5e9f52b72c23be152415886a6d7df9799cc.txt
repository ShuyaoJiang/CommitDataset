Tests: Increase logging for watcher smoke tests

These tests have repeating but not reproducible failures,
where the stash is filled with a second PUT operation and the
watcher stats response does not match. Setting the log to trace
should shed some light on this.

As the smoke tests are only four tests this will not lead to a
log explosion.
