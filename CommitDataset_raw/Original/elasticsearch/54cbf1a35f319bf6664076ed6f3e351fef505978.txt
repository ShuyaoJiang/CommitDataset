Never block on scheduled refresh if a refresh is running (#39462)

Today we block on the ReferenceManager in the case of a scheduled refresh.
Yet if there is a refresh happening concurrently we might block and create
very smallish segments. Instead we should just move on to the next shard
and free up the refresh thread instead.
