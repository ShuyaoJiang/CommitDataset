Refactor children aggregator into a generic ParentJoinAggregator (#34845)

This commit adds a new ParentJoinAggregator that implements a join using global ordinals
in a way that can be reused by the `children` and the upcoming `parent` aggregation.
This new aggregator is a refactor of the existing ParentToChildrenAggregator with two main changes:
* It uses a dense bit array instead of a long array when the aggregation does not have any parent.
* It uses a single aggregator per bucket if it is nested under another aggregation.
For the latter case we use a `MultiBucketAggregatorWrapper` in the factory in order to ensure that each
instance of the aggregator handles a single bucket. This is more inlined with the strategy we use for other
aggregations like `terms` aggregation for instance since the number of buckets to handle should be low (thanks to the breadth_first strategy).
This change is also required for #34210 which adds the `parent` aggregation in the parent-join module.
