Security: add manage_index_templates to the kibana_system role (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3009)

This commit adds the manage_index_templates permission to the kibana_system role that is used by
the kibana system user. This is needed due to an upcoming feature in kibana where a index template
will be used to create the saved objects index.
