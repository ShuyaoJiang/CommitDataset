Add a `feature_vector` field. (#31102)

This field is similar to the `feature` field but is better suited to index
sparse feature vectors. A use-case for this field could be to record topics
associated with every documents alongside a metric that quantifies how well
the topic is connected to this document, and then boost queries based on the
topics that the logged user is interested in.
