Remove usage of transient settings to enable allocations in rolling upgrade docs (#29671)

Since we disable allocation using persistent settings, we should be consistent and remove
the setting from the persistent storage. Otherwise an accidental restart will lead for shards
not being allocated.

Relates to #28757
