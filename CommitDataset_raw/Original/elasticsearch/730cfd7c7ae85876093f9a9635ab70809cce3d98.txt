Watcher: Remote WatcherClientProxy/ClientProxy class (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1561)

This commit removes ClientProxy and WatcherClientProxy classes. They
were added in times, where there were issues with guice and circular
dependencies. However there is no guice anymore and on top of that
the classes do not add any value.

We can switch to use a regular client, but have to make sure that
the InternalClient is injected in all the transport actions as those
is able to query data, when security is enabled.
