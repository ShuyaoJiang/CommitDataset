Fix custom AUTO issue with Fuzziness#toXContent (#35807)

Currently when a Fuzziness instance with custom AUTO distance values gets
written to XContent, the customized lower and upper distance values are ommited
and can consequently not be parsed back. This changes this to write the String
including the optional custom values when writing to XContent and fixes the
tests that should have caught this in the first place, e.g. by adding the custom
low and high distance values to the equality check.
