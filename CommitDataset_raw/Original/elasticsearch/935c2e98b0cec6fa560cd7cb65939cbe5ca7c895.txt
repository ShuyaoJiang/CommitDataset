Zen2: Turn to follower on follower check when no state accepted yet from new leader (#37003)

Improves on #36449 which did not cover the situation where a node had bumped its term during
the election, and not when receiving the first follower check. This was uncovered while refactoring
NodeJoinTests so that they don't need to access to an internal field of Coordinator anymore (which
can now be made private).
