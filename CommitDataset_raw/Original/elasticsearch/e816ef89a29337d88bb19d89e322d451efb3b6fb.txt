Shade external dependencies in the rest client jar

This commit removes all external dependencies from the rest client jar
and shades them in an 'org.elasticsearch.client' package within the jar
using shadowJar gradle plugin. All projects that depended on the
existing jar have been converted to using the 'org.elasticsearch.client'
package prefixes to interact with the rest client.

Closes #25208
