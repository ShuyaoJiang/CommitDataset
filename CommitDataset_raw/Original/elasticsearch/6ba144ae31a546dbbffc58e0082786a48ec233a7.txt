Add WeightedAvg metric aggregation (#31037)

Adds a new single-value metrics aggregation that computes the weighted 
average of numeric values that are extracted from the aggregated 
documents. These values can be extracted from specific numeric
fields in the documents.

When calculating a regular average, each datapoint has an equal "weight"; it
contributes equally to the final value.  In contrast, weighted averages
scale each datapoint differently.  The amount that each datapoint contributes 
to the final value is extracted from the document, or provided by a script.

As a formula, a weighted average is the `∑(value * weight) / ∑(weight)`

A regular average can be thought of as a weighted average where every value has
an implicit weight of `1`.
