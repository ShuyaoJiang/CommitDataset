Do not use system properties when building the HttpAsyncClient (#27829)

This commit removes the usage of system properties for the HttpAsyncClient as this overrides some
defaults that we intentionally change. In order to set the default SSLContext to the system context
we set the SSLContext on the builder explicitly.

Closes #27827
