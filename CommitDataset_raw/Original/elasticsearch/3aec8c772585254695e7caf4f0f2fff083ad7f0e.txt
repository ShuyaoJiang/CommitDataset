Packaging: Set elasticsearch user to have non-existent homedir (#29007)

This commit adds setting the homedir for the elasticsearch user to the
adduser command in the packaging preinstall script. While the
elasticsearch user is a system user, it is sometimes conventient to have
an existing homedir (even if it is not writeable). For example, running
cron as the elasticsearch user will try to change dir to the homedir.
