[ML] Interrupt Grok in file structure finder timeout (#36588)

The file structure finder has timeout functionality,
but prior to this change it would not interrupt a
single long-running Grok match attempt.

This commit hooks into the ThreadWatchdog facility
provided by the Grok library to interrupt individual
Grok matches that may be running at the time the
file structure finder timeout expires.
