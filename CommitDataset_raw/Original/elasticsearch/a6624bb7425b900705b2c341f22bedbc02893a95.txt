[Test] Update test in SharedClusterSnapshotRestoreIT (#30200)

The `testDeleteSnapshotWithMissingIndexAndShardMetadata` test uses an
obsolete repository directory structure based on index names instead of
UUIDs. Because it swallows exceptions when deleting test files the test
never failed when the directory structure changed.

This commit fixes the test to use the right directory structure and file
 names and to not swallow exceptions anymore.
