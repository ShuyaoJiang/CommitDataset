Add dedicated retention lease exceptions (#38754)

When a retention lease already exists on an add retention lease
invocation, or a retention lease is not found on a renew retention lease
invocation today we throw an illegal argument exception. This puts a
burden on the caller to catch that specific exception and parse the
message. This commit relieves the burden from the caller by adding
dedicated exception types for these situations.
