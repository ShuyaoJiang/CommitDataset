Check that client methods match API defined in the REST spec (#31825)

We have been encountering name mismatches between API defined in our
REST spec and method names that have been added to the high-level REST
client. We should check this automatically to prevent furher mismatches,
and correct all the current ones.

This commit adds a test for this and corrects the issues found by it.
