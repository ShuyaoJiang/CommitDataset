SQL: Implement null safe equality operator `<=>` (#35873)

This operator handles nulls in different way than the normal `=`.
If one of the operants is `null` and the other not it returns `false`.
If both operants are `null` it returns `true`. Therefore in contrary to
`=`, which returns `null` if at least one of the operants is `null`, this one
never returns `null` as a result.

Closes: #35871
