ingest: support simulate with verbose for pipeline processor (#33839)

* ingest: support simulate with verbose for pipeline processor

This change better supports the use of simulate?verbose with the
pipeline processor. Prior to this change any pipeline processors
executed with simulate?verbose would not show all intermediate 
processors for the inner pipelines.

This changes also moves the PipelineProcess and TrackingResultProcessor
classes to enable instance checks and to avoid overly public classes.
As well this updates the error message for when cycles are detected
in pipelines calling other pipelines.
