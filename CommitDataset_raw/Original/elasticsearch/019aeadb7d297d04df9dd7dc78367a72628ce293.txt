HLRC: Reindex should support `requests_per_seconds` parameter (#33808)

The high level Rest clients reindex method currently doesn't pass on the
"requests_per_second" that are optionally set in ReindexRequest through the Rest
layer. This change makes sure the value is added to the request parameters if
set and also includes it for the update-by-query and delete-by-query cases.
