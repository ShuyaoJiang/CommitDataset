Removes NativeRealmMigrator since its no longer needed (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2028)

With the new template and mapping update mechanisms introduced as part
of the Upgrade API work, the NativeRealmMigrator is no longer needed or
used.  This commit removes the NativeRealmMigrator code and the
associated tests for it.
