Replace usages RandomizedTestingTask with built-in Gradle Test (#40564)

This commit replaces the existing RandomizedTestingTask and supporting code with Gradle's built-in JUnit support via the Test task type. Additionally, the previous workaround to disable all tasks named "test" and create new unit testing tasks named "unitTest" has been removed such that the "test" task now runs unit tests as per the normal Gradle Java plugin conventions
