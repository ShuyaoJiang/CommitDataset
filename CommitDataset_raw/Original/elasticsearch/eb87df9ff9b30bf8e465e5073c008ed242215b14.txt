Allow abort of bulk items before processing (#26434)

Adds support for bulk items to be aborted before they are processed by the TransportShardBulkAction.
This can be used by an ActionFilter to reject a subset of the items in a bulk action without rejecting the whole action (or all the items for a shard).
