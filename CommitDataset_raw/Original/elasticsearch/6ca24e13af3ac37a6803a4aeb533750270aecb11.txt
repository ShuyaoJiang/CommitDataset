Painless: Use LocalMethod Map For Lookup at Runtime (#32599)

This modifies Def to use a Map<String, LocalMethod> to look up user-defined methods at runtime 
instead of writing constant methodhandles to do the reverse lookup. This creates a consistency 
between how LocalMethods are looked up at compile-time and run-time. This consistency will allow 
this code to be more maintainable moving forward. This will also allow FunctionReference to be 
cleaned up in a follow up PR.
