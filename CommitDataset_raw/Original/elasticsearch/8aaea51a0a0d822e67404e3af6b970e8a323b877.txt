Scripting: Move context definitions to instance type classes (#24883)

This is a simple refactoring to move the context definitions into the
type that they use. While we have multiple context names for the same
class at the moment, this will eventually become one ScriptContext per
instance type, so the pattern of a static member on the interface called
CONTEXT can be used. This commit also moves the consolidated list of
contexts provided by core ES into ScriptModule.
