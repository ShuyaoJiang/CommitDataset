Add superset size to Significant Term REST response (#24865)

This commit adds a new bg_count field to the REST response of
SignificantTerms aggregations. Similarly to the bg_count that already
exists in significant terms buckets, this new bg_count field is set at
the aggregation level and is populated with the superset size value.
