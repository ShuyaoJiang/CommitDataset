Use file-based discovery not MockUncasedHostsProvider (#33554)

Today we use a special unicast hosts provider, the `MockUncasedHostsProvider`,
in many integration tests, to deal with the dynamic nature of the allocation of
ports to nodes. However #33241 allows us to use file-based discovery to achieve
the same goal, so the special test-only `MockUncasedHostsProvider` is no longer
required.

This change removes `MockUncasedHostProvider` and replaces it with file-based
discovery in tests based on `EsIntegTestCase`.
