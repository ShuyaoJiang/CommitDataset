Build: Use md5 to determine whether ml snapshot needs downloading (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3612)

This commit makes ML snapshot downloading happen less often. It does
that by first moving the download location to a directory outside the
destructive power of gradle clean, and then also uses the md5 of the zip
to compare to that found in s3. This allows us to do a cheap HEAD
request to find if the file has changed.
