Remove timezone validation on rollup range queries (#40647)

We enforced the timezone of range queries when using the rollup
search endpoint, but this validation is not needed.  Since
rollup dates are stored in UTC, and range queries are always
converted to UTC (even if specifying a `time_zone`) the validation
is not needed and can prevent legitimate queries from running.
