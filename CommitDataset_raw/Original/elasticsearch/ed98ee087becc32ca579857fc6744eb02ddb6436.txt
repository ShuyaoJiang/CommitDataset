[ML] Stop the ML memory tracker before closing node (#39111)

The ML memory tracker does searches against ML results
and config indices.  These searches can be asynchronous,
and if they are running while the node is closing then
they can cause problems for other components.

This change adds a stop() method to the MlMemoryTracker
that waits for in-flight searches to complete.  Once
stop() has returned the MlMemoryTracker will not kick
off any new searches.

The MlLifeCycleService now calls MlMemoryTracker.stop()
before stopping stopping the node.

Fixes #37117
