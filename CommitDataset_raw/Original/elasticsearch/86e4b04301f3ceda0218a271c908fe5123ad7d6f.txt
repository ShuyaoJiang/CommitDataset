HLRC: Convert xpack methods to client side objects (#40705)

This commit fixes a problem with BWC that was brought up in #40511. A
newer version of the code was emitting a new value for an enum to an
older version, and the older version could not handle that. It caused
the response to error. The MainResponse is now relaxed, and will accept
whatever values the server expose, and holds most of them as Strings
instead of complex objects.

Fixes #40511
