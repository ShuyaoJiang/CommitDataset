Unify http channels and exception handling (#31379)

This is a general cleanup of channels and exception handling in http.
This commit introduces a CloseableChannel that is a superclass of
TcpChannel and HttpChannel. This allows us to unify the closing logic
between tcp and http transports. Additionally, the normal http channels
are extracted to the abstract server transport.

Finally, this commit (mostly) unifies the exception handling between nio
and netty4 http server transports.
