Security: Rename IndexLifecycleManager to SecurityIndexManager (#30442)

This commit renames IndexLifecycleManager to SecurityIndexManager as it
is not actually a general purpose class, but specific to security. It
also removes indirection in code calling the lifecycle service, instead
calling the security index manager directly.
