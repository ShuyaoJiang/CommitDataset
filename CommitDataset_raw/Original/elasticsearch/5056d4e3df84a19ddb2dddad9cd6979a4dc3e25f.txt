Revert unintended changes to syskeygen from elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1831 (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2055)

During the development of elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1831 (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch@5ac95c6) there was an intention to replace `SystemKeyTool` with `EncKeyTool`.
The java change was reverted and never committed to master, but the script change was accidentally left in place.

Also removes redundant "properties" variable (refer `elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch@b0a3b89`)
