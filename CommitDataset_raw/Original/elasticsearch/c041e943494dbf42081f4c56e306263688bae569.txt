Test that transient settings beat persistent ones (#33818)

Transient settings override persistent settings, but in fact all of the tests
that run as part of `:server:test` and `:server:integTest` will pass if the
precedence is changed to be the other way round. This change adds a test that
verifies the precedence is as documented.
