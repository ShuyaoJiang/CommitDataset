Limit the number of nested documents (#27405)

Add an index level setting `index.mapping.nested_objects.limit` to control
the number of nested json objects that can be in a single document
across all fields. Defaults to 10000.

Throw an error if the number of created nested documents exceed this
limit during the parsing of a document.
