Set Lucene version upon index creation. (#36038)

It is important that all shards of a given index have the same
`indexCreatedVersionMajor` to Lucene, or eg. merging those shards is going to
be considered illegal. At the moment, we use the latest Lucene version when
creating a shard, which could cause shards to have different created versions
eg. in case of forced allocation. This commit makes sure to reuse the
appropriate Lucene version in order to avoid such issues.

Closes #33826
