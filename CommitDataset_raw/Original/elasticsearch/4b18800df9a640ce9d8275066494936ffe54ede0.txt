Fix handling of invalid error trace parameter

If a request contains an invalid error trace parameter, we send a error
on the channel. This should immediately abort any additional processing
of the request but instead we march on, dispatch the request and
subsequently send another message on the channel. The problem here is
this means two writes on the channel which leads to the request being
released twice ultimately raising in illegal reference count
exception. This commit addresses this by performing an early return in
the case that the request contained an invalid error trace parameter.
