Add a scripted similarity. (#25831)

The goal of this similarity is to help users who would like to keep the
functionality of the `tf-idf` similarity that we want to remove, or to allow
for specific usec-cases (disabling idf, disabling tf, disabling length norm,
etc.) to not have to build a custom plugin and familiarize with the low-level
Lucene API.
