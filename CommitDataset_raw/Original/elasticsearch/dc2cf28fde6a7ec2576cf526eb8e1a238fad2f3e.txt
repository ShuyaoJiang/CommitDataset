Docs: Allow skipping response assertions (#34240)

We generate tests from our documentation, including assertions about the
responses returned by a particular API. But sometimes we *can't* assert
that the response is correct because of some defficiency in our tooling.
Previously we marked the response `// NOTCONSOLE` to skip it, but this
is kind of odd because `// NOTCONSOLE` is really to mark snippets that
are json but aren't requests or responses. This introduces a new
construct to skip response assertions:
```
// TESTRESPONSE[skip:reason we skipped this]
```
