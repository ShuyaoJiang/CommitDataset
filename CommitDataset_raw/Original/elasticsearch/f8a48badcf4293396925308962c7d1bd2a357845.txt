Settings: Remove shared setting property (#24728)

Shared settings were added intially to allow the few common settings
names across aws plugins. However, in 6.0 these settings have been
removed. The last use was in netty, but since 6.0 also has the netty 3
modules removed, there is no longer a need for the shared property. This
commit removes the shared setting property.
