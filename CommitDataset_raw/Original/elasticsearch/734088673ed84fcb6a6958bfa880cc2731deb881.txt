[ML] Include message in field_stats for text log files (#34861)

This change ensures the `message` field is always included
in the `field_stats` for the semi-structured text log file
file structure.  Previously it was not, as it will almost
certainly contain all distinct values.  However, for
consistency in the UI it's useful to include it.
