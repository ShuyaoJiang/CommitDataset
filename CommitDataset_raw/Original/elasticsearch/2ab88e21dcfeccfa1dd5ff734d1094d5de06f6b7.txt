Also mmap cfs files for hybridfs (#38940)

With this commit we add the `.cfs` file extension to the list of file
types that are memory-mapped by hybridfs. `.cfs` files combine all files
of a Lucene segment into a single file in order to save file handles. As
this strategy is only used for "small" segments (less than 10% of the
shard size), it is benefical to memory-map them instead of accessing
them via NIO.
