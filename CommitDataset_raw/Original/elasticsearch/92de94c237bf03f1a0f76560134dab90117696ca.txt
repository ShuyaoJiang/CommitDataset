[ML] Don't treat stale FAILED jobs as OPENING in job allocation (#31800)

Job persistent tasks with stale allocation IDs used to always be
considered as OPENING jobs in the ML job node allocation decision.
However, FAILED jobs are not relocated to other nodes, which leads
to them blocking up the nodes they failed on after node restarts.
FAILED jobs should not restrict how many other jobs can open on a
node, regardless of whether they are stale or not.

Closes #31794
