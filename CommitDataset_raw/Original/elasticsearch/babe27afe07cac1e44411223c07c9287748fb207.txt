[ML] Add a detector_index field to detectors, and use it for updates (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1613)

Detectors now have a field called detector_index.  This is also now the
field that needs to be supplied when updating a detector.  (Previously
it was simply index, which was confusing.)

When detectors are added to an analysis_config it will reassign
ascending detector_index values starting from 0.  The intention is
never to allow deletion of detectors from an analysis_config, but
possibly to allow disabling them in the future.  This ensures that
detector_index values in results will always tie up with detector_ids
in the detectors that created them.
