Squashed commit of the following: (#39836)

Add a checkpoint service for data frame transforms, which allows to ask for a checkpoint of the
source. In future these checkpoints will be stored in the internal index to

 - detect upstream changes
 - updating the data frame without a full re-run
 - allow data frame clients to checkpoint themselves
