Fix broken NaN check in MovingFunctions#stdDev() (#31888)

The initial check will never be true, because of the special semantics of NaN,
where no value is equal to Nan, including NaN. Thus, x == Double.NaN always
evaluates to false. The method still works correct because later computations
will also return NaN if the avg argument is NaN, but the intended shortcut
doesn't work.
