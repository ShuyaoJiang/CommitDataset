Scripts: Fix security for deprecation warning (#28485)

If you call `getDates()` on a long or date type field add a deprecation
warning to the response and log something to the deprecation logger.
This *mostly* worked just fine but if the deprecation logger happens to
roll then the roll will be performed with the script's permissions
rather than the permissions of the server. And scripts don't have
permissions to, say, open files. So the rolling failed. This fixes that
by wrapping the call the deprecation logger in `doPriviledged`.

This is a strange `doPrivileged` call because it doens't check
Elasticsearch's `SpecialPermission`. `SpecialPermission` is a permission
that no-script code has and that scripts never have. Usually all
`doPrivileged` calls check `SpecialPermission` to make sure that they
are not accidentally acting on behalf of a script. But in this case we
are *intentionally* acting on behalf of a script.
