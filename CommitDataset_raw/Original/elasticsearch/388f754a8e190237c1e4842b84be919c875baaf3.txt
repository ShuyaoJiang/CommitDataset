Change step execution flow to be deliberate about type (#34126)

This commit changes the way that step execution flows. Rather than have any step
run when the cluster state changes or the periodic scheduler fires, this now
runs the different types of steps at different times.

`AsyncWaitStep` is run at a periodic manner, ie, every 10 minutes by default
`ClusterStateActionStep` and `ClusterStateWaitStep` are run every time the
cluster state changes.
`AsyncActionStep` is now run only after the cluster state has been transitioned
into a new step. This prevents these non-idempotent steps from running at the
same time. It addition to being run when transitioned into, this is also run
when a node is newly elected master (only if set as the current step) so that
master failover does not fail to run the step.

This also changes the `RolloverStep` from an `AsyncActionStep` to an
`AsyncWaitStep` so that it can run periodically.

Relates to #29823
