Update logstash-management.json to use typeless template (#38653)

This commit changes the type from "doc" to "_doc" for the
.logstash-management template. Since this is an internally
managed template it does not always go through the REST
layer for it's internal representation.  The internal
representation requires the default "_doc" type, which for
external templates is added in the REST layer.
