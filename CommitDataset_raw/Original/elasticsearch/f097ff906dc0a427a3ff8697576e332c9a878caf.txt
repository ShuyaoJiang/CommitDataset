Ensure only 1 in-flight request to create each watcher index template (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1660)

The aim of this change is to prevent many identical requests to create
watcher index templates being submitted when a cluster first starts up
and many cluster state updates are happening.  Prior to this change, if
watcher's original index template creation requests queued up behind other
cluster state change requests then for each other request watcher would
re-request creation of all its index templates.  After this change it
uses a strategy similar to that used by ML to only have one creation
request per index template in the cluster state change queue at any time.
