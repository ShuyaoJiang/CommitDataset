remove testUnassignedShardAndEmptyNodesInRoutingTable

testUnassignedShardAndEmptyNodesInRoutingTable and that test is as old as time and does a very bogus thing.
it is an IT test which extracts the GatewayAllocator from the node and tells it to allocated unassigned
shards, while giving it a conjured cluster state with no nodes in it (it uses the DiscoveryNodes.EMPTY_NODES.
This is never a cluster state we want to reroute on (we always have at least master node in it).
I'm going to just delete the test as I don't think it adds much value.

Closes #21463
