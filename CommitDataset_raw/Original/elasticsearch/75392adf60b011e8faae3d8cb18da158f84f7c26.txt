[TEST] Convert SearchHitsTests to AbstractStreamableXContentTestCase (#36313)

This change adds a way to provide the content type of the rest serialization
tests when creating random instances. This is used by SearchHitsTests to ensure
that the internal members of the class are created with the same xContentType
and that equals can be used to compare an instances created from an XContent
view.
