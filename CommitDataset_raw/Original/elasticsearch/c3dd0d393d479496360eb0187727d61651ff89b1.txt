SQL: Simplify function registration and resolution (#36417)

Previously, we used a CamelCase to CAMEL_CASE transformation to get the
primary name of a function from its class name which led to some issues
since there are functions that we don't want to be registered this way
(e.g.: IFNULL). To simplify the logic and avoid and "magic"
transformations in the FunctionRegistry a primary name must be provided
explicitely for each function.

The same change is applied for the function resolution (when a function
is used in an SQL statement). There is no CamelCase to CAMEL_CASE
transformation but only upper-casing is applied (fuNcTiOn -> FUNCTION).
