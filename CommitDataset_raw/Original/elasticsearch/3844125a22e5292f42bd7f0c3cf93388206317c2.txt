Un-hardcode SecurityIndexManager to handle generic indices (#40064)

`SecurityIndexManager` is hardcoded to handle only the `.security`-`.security-7` alias-index pair.
This commit removes the hardcoded bits, so that the `SecurityIndexManager` can be reused
for other indices, such as the planned security tokens index (`.security-tokens-7`).
