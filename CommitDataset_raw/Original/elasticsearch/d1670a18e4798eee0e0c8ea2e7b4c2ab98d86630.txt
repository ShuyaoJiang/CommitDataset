Do not serialize common stats flags using ordinal (#29600)

This commit remove serializing of common stats flags via its enum
ordinal and uses an explicit index defined on the enum. This is to
enable us to remove an unused flag (Suggest) without ruining the
ordering and thus breaking serialization.
