Always set soft-deletes field of IndexWriterConfig (#36196)

Today we configure the soft-deletes field iff soft-deletes enabled.
Although this choice was correct, it prevents an engine with
soft-deletes disabled from opening a Lucene index with soft-deletes.
Moreover, this change should not have any side-effect if a Lucene index
does not have any soft-deletes.
