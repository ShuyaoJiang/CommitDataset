Use SPI to glean reserved roles (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3012)

This commit uses SPI to get the list of system wide reserved roles in
security. It does not yet split out the RoleDescriptor to a common
location so the implementing services still depend on security. Each
role, however, only depends on its own feature as well as security.
