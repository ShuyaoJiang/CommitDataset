Deprecate use of `htmlStrip` as name for HtmlStripCharFilter (#27429)

The camel case name `htmlStip` should be removed in favour of `html_strip`, but
we need to deprecate it first. This change adds deprecation warnings for indices 
with version starting with 6.3.0 and logs deprecation warnings in this cases.
