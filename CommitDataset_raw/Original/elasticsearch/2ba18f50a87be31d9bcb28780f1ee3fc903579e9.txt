SQL: Remove more ANTLR4 grammar ambiguities (#34074)

The `-` and `+` as a number literal prefix are already
parsed by the rule in `valueExpression`. To accommodate
this, there are some code changes that enables the
`ExpressionBuilder` to parse Literal integers and decimals
together with the `-/+` prefix sign (if exists) and validate
them (wrong format, large numbers, etc.).

Follows: #33854
