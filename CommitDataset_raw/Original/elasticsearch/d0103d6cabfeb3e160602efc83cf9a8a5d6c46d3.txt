[TEST] Fixes PageParamsTests to no underflow from and size

In `mutateInstance()` the from or size could become negative if the other one was pushed over the limit for `from + size`. This change fixes this case to make sure after the mutate method is called the from and size obey the limit but are also both `>= 0`
