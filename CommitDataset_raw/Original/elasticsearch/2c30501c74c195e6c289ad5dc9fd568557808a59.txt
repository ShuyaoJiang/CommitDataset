SQL: Fix esType for DATETIME/DATE and INTERVALS (#38179)

Since introduction of data types that don't have a corresponding type
in ES the `esType` is error-prone when used for `unmappedType()` calls.
Moreover since the renaming of `DATE` to `DATETIME` and the introduction
of an actual date-only `DATE` the `esType` would return `datetime` which
is not a valid type for ES mapping.

Fixes: #38051
