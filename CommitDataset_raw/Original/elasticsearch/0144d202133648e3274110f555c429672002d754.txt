[test] remove Streamable serde assertions (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4261)

Serialization assertions in ElasticsearchAssertions, a transport
interceptor that used them, and a plugin that added that interceptor
were removed from the test framework. This test case no longer needs to
exclude them from its plugins.
