Enhance Parent circuit breaker error message (#32056)

* Enhance Parent circuit breaker error message

This adds information about either the current real usage (if tracking "real"
memory usage) or the child breaker usages to the exception message when the
parent circuit breaker trips.

The messages now look like:

```
[parent] Data too large, data for [my_request] would be [211288064/201.5mb], which is larger than the limit of [209715200/200mb], usages [request=157286400/150mb, fielddata=54001664/51.5mb, in_flight_requests=0/0b, accounting=0/0b]
```

Or when tracking real memory usage:

```
[parent] Data too large, data for [request] would be [251/251b], which is larger than the limit of [200/200b], real usage: [181/181b], new bytes reserved: [70/70b]
```

* Only call currentMemoryUsage once by returning structured object
