Correctly reset persistent settings in teardown

In the refresh REST tests we setup some persistent settings for debug
logging. In the teardown, we try to restore the logging level back to
info via another persistent setting but this is a mistake because other
tests check if there are no persistent settings. To fix this, we remove
the persistent setting that we added.
