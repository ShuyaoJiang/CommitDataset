Build: Fix the license in the pom zip and tar (#31336)

For 6.3 we renamed the `tar` and `zip` distributions to `oss-tar` and
`oss-zip`. Then we added new `tar` and `zip` distributions that contain
x-pack and are licensed under the Elastic License. Unfortunately we
accidentally generated POM files along side the new `tar` and `zip`
distributions that incorrectly claimed that they were Apache 2 licensed.
Oooops.

This fixes the license on the POMs generated for the `tar` and `zip`
distributions.
