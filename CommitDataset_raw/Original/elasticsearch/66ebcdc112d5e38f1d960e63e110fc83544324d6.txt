Enable using defined setups from test setup in docs (#34681)

In the docs tests, we have pre-defined setups in the build.gradle file,
and we can also define test setup sections within the doc page
itself. Alas, these two are incompatible in that if you try to use a
pre-defined setup alongside a test setup section, the pre-defined setup
will be silently ignored. This commit enables pre-defined setup sections
to be used together with test setup sections. The ordering here is that
pre-defined setup sections will be executed first, followed by the test
setup section.
