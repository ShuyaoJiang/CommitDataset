Remove the xpack plugin's dependency on the tribe module (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2901)

This change removes the xpack plugin's dependency on the tribe module, which is not a published
artifact. For the most part this just involves moving some test classes around, but for the
security and tribe integration the usage of constant settings was removed and replaced with the
string names. This is a bit unfortunate, but a test was added in a QA project that depends on tribe
that will alert us if a new setting is added that we need to be aware of.
