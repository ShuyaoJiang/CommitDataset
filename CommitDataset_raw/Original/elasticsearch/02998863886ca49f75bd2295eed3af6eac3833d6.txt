[Tests] Use XPack Usage API to verify Monitoring exporters are disabled (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2648)

This commit changes the MonitoringIt and XPackRestIT tests so that the
disableMonitoring() method now use the XPack Usage API in order to check
that the monitoring exporters are correctly disabled. It checks at the
beginning of the tests (all exporters must be disabled before running
the test) and also at the end of the test.

This commit also fixes a bug in MonitoringIT where the Bulk thread pool
active queue was wrongly extracted from the response's map, forcing the
test to always wait for 30sec.
