Avoid side-effect in VersionMap when assertion enabled (#29585)

Today when a version map does not require safe access, we will skip that
document. However, if the assertion is enabled, we remove the delete
tombstone of that document if existed. This side-effect may accidentally
hide bugs in which stale delete tombstone can be accessed.

This change ensures putAssertionMap not modify the tombstone maps.
