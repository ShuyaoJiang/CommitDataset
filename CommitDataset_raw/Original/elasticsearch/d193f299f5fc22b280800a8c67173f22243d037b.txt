Only run retention lease actions on active primary (#40386)

In some cases, a request to perform a retention lease action can arrive
on a primary shard before it is active. In this case, the primary shard
would not yet be in primary mode, tripping an assertion in the
replication tracker. Instead, we should not attempt to perform such
actions on an initializing shard. This commit addresses this by not
returning the primary shard in the single shard iterator if the primary
shard is not yet active.
