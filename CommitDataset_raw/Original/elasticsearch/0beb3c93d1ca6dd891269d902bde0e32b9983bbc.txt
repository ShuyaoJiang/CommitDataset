Clean up duplicate follow config parameter code (#37688)

Introduced FollowParameters class that put follow, resume follow,
put auto follow pattern requests and follow info response classes reuse.

The FollowParameters class had the fields, getters etc. for the common parameters
that all these APIs have.  Also binary and xcontent serialization /
parsing is handled by this class.

The follow, resume follow, put auto follow pattern request classes originally
used optional non primitive fields, so FollowParameters has that too and the follow info api can handle that now too.

Also the followerIndex field can in production only be specified via
the url path. If it is also specified via the request body then
it must have the same value as is specified in the url path. This
option only existed to xcontent testing. However the AbstractSerializingTestCase
base class now also supports createXContextTestInstance() to provide
a different test instance when testing xcontent, so allowing followerIndex
to be specified via the request body is no longer needed.

By moving the followerIndex field from Body to ResumeFollowAction.Request
class and not allowing the followerIndex field to be specified via
the request body the Body class is redundant and can be removed. The
ResumeFollowAction.Request class can then directly use the
FollowParameters class.

For consistency I also removed the ability to specified followerIndex
in the put follow api and the name in put auto follow pattern api via
the request body.
