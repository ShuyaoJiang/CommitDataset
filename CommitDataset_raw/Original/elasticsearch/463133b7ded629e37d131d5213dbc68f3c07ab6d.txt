[Security] Cross cluster wildcard security (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1290)

Support the resolution of remote index names, including those that contain wildcards in the cluster name or index part)

Specifically these work:
- `GET /remote*:foo/_search`
- `GET /*:foo/_search`
- `GET /*:foo,*/_search`
- `GET /remote:*/_search`
- `GET /*:*/_search`

This change assumes that every user is allowed to attempt a cross-cluster search against any remote index, and the actual authorisation of indices happens on the remote nodes. Thus ` GET /*:foo/_search` will expand to search the `foo` index on every registered remote without consideration of the roles and privileges that the user has on the source cluster.
