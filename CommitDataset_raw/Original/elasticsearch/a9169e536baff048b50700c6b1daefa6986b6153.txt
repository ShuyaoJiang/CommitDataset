Several internal improvements to internal test cluster infra (#26214)

This chance adds several random test infrastructure improvements that caused
issues in on-going developments but are generally useful. For instance is it impossible
to restart a node with a secure setting source since we close it after the node is started.
This change makes it cloneable such that we can reuse it for a restart.
