copy LifecyclePolicy to protocol.xpack (#32915)

This is the final PR for copying over the necessary components for
clients to parse/render LifecyclePolicy. Changes include:

- move of named-x-content server objects away from client
- move validation into the client copy of LifecyclePolicy
- move LifecycleAction into an interface with `getName`
