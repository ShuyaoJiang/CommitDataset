Build: Log a warning if disabling reindex-from-old (#30304)

We disable the reindex-from-old tests if we're running on windows or in
a directory that contains a space. This adds a warning to the logs when
we do that so that you can tell that it happened. This will be nice to
have when looking at CI and will be a hint to anyone developing locally.
