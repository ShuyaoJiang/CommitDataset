Reindex: log more on rare test failure

The test failure tracked by #26758 occurs when we cancel a running reindex
request that has been sliced into many children. The main reindex
response *looks* canceled but none of the children look canceled. This
is super strange because for the main request to look canceled for any
length of time one of the children has to be canceled.

This change adds additional logging to the test so we have more to go on
to debug this the next time it fails.
