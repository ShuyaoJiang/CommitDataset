[Monitoring] Add Cluster Alert Blacklist (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3326)

This adds a traditional blacklist that can be set [dynamically] at the exporter level to block specific cluster alerts (watches) from being created. It goes further and actually removes any watch that has been created already for the current cluster.
