Fix license on AcitveDirectorySIDUtil (#30972)

This code is from an Apache 2.0 licensed codebase and when we imported
it into our codebase it carried the Apache 2.0 license as well. However,
during the migration of the X-Pack codebase from the internal private
repository to the elastic/elasticsearch repository, the migration tool
mistakently changed the license on this source file from the Apache 2.0
license to the Elastic license. This commit addresses this mistake by
reapplying the Apache 2.0 license.
