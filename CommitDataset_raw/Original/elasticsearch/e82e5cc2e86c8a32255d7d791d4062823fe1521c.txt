high level REST api: cancel task (#30745)

* Initial commit of rest high level exposure of cancel task

* fix javadocs

* address some code review comments

* update branch to use tasks namespace instead of cluster

* High-level client: list tasks failure to not lose nodeId

This commit reworks testing for `ListTasksResponse` so that random
fields insertion can be tested and xcontent equivalence can be checked
too. Proper exclusions need to be configured, and failures need to be
tested separately. This helped finding a little problem, whenever there
is a node failure returned, the nodeId was lost as it was never printed
out as part of the exception toXContent.

* added comment

* merge from master

* re-work CancelTasksResponseTests to separate XContent failure cases from non-failure cases

* remove duplication of logic in parser creation

* code review changes

* refactor TasksClient to support RequestOptions

* add tests for parent task id

* address final PR review comments, mostly formatting and such
