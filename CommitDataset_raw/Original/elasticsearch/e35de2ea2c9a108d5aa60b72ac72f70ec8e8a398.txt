Synchronize WriteReplicaResult callbacks (#36770)

TransportWriteAction.WriteReplicaResult is not properly synchronized, which can lead to a data race
between the thread that calls respond and the AsyncAfterWriteAction that calls either onSuccess or
onFailure. This data race results in the response listener not being called, which ultimately results in
a stuck replication task on the replica.
