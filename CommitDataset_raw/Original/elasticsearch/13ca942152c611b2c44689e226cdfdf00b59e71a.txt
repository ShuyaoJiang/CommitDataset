Switch build-tools to latest target version (#34746)

- we already require Java 11 to build, yet we target the minimum
supported version in build-tools ( currently 8 )
- this is because we have some checks that are executed in a new JVM
which could be running the minimum version.
- For everything else it would be nice to be able to use new features,
like the new process API.

With this change, we selectively compile the few classes that need an
older target version and move everything over to Java 10.
Unfortunately the current Gradle version does not support 11 as a target
version yet.
