[ML] Add notification for job updates coming from a user action (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3890)

We were missing a notification for when a job is updated. This is
useful so users know that there's been changes which could justify
a change in the job behaviour.

In addition, having those notifications allows our integrations
tests to know when the update was processed which avoids having
to use `sleep()` with its instabilities.
