QA: Add xpack tests to rolling upgrade (#30795)

A rolling upgrade from oss Elasticsearch to the default distribution of
Elasticsearch is significantly different than a full cluster restart to
install a plugin and is again different from starting a new cluster with
xpack installed. So this adds some basic tests to make sure that the
rolling upgrade that enables xpack works at all.

This also removes some unused imports from the tests that I modified in
PR #30728. I didn't mean to leave them.
