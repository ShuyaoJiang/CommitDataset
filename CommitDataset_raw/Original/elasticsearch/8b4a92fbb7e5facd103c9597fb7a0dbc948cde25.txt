Adjust assertions for sequence numbers BWC tests

This commit adjusts the assertions for the sequence number BWC tests to
account for the fact that sometimes these tests are run in
mixed-clusters with 5.6 nodes (that do not understand sequence numbers),
and sometimes these tests are run in mixed-cluster with 6.0+ nodes (that
all understood sequence numbers).
