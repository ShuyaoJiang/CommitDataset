[Tests] Make testEngineGCDeletesSetting deterministic (#38942)

`InternalEngine.resolveDocVersion()` uses `relativeTimeInMillis()` from
`ThreadPool` so it needs, the cached time to be advanced. Add a check
to ensure that and decrease the `thread_pool.estimated_time_interval`
to 1msec to prevent long running times for the test.
