[ML] Validate job configs before transport (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1375)

If invalid job configs are transported to the master node then the root
cause of the validation exception gets reported as a remote_transport_exception,
which is extremely confusing.

This commit moves the validation of job configurations to the first node that
handles the action.

Fixes elastic/x-pack-kibana#1172
