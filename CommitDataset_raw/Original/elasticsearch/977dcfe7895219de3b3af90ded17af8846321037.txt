Deprecate global_ordinals_hash and global_ordinals_low_cardinality (#26173)

* Deprecate global_ordinals_hash and global_ordinals_low_cardinality

This change deprecates the `global_ordinals_hash` and `global_ordinals_low_cardinality` and
makes the `global_ordinals` execution hint choose internally if global ords should be remapped or use the segment ord directly.
These hints are too sensitive and expert to be exposed and we should be able to take the right decision internally based on the agg tree.
