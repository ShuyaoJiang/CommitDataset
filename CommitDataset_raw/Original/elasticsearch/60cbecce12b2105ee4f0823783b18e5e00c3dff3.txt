SQL: Fix bug with JDBC timezone setting and DATE type (#39978)

Previously, JDBC's REST call to the server was always sending UTC
instead of the timezone passed through connection string/properties.

Moreover the conversion to java.sql.Date was problematic as a
calculation on the epoch millis was used to set the time to 00:00:00.000
and the timezone info was lost. This caused the resulting java.sql.Date
object which is always using the JVM's timezone (no matter what timezone
setting is used in the connection string/properties) to be wrongly created.

Fixes: #39915
