Unmute, fix, refactor and zen2ify NetworkDisruptionIT (#38351)

This commit unmutes NetworkDisruptionIT.

It makes changes necessary for Zen2 - avoids usage of
autoMinMasterNodes and selects cluster size, such that there is no
need to call AddVotingExclusion.
This test also introduces refactors a single method
prepareDistruptedCluster to be used by both test methods.
Unfortunately, NetworkDisruption is broken and the
testNetworkPartitionRemovalRestoresConnections "is fixed" by
introducing assertBusy - #38348.
