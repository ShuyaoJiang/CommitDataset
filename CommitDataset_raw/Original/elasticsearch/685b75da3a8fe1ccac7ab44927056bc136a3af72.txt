Support changes in nio channel contexts (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3609)

This is related to elastic/elasticsearch#elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#28275. It modifies x-pack to
support the changes in channel contexts. Additionally, it simplifies
the SSLChannelContext by relying on some common work between it and
BytesChannelContext.
