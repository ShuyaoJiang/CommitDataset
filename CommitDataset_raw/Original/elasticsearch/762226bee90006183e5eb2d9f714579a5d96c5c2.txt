Docs: Support triple quotes (#28915)

Adds support for triple quoted strings to the documentation test
generator. Kibana's CONSOLE tool has supported them for a year but we
were unable to use them in Elasticsearch's docs because the process that
converts example snippets into tests couldn't handle this. This change
adds code to convert them into standard JSON so we can pass them to
Elasticsearch.
