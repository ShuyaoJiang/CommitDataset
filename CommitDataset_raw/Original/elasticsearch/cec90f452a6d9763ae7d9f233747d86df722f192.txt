IndexLifecycleManager checks for index existense and up to date mappings (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3515)

This change makes the IndexLifecycleManager check for both index existence and up to date mappings
on the index prior to executing the provided runnable. Doing this provides a mechanism to make
non-breaking mapping updates to the security index in minor versions.
