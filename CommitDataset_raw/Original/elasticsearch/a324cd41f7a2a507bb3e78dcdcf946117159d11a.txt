Build: Move gradle wrapper jar to a dot dir (#30146)

This commit moves the gradle wrapper jar file to a hidden directory, so
that it does not clutter the top level names seen when doing an ls in
the project. The actual jar file is never manually edited, and only
changed by running `./gradlew wrapper ...` so it is not important for
this directory to be "visible".
