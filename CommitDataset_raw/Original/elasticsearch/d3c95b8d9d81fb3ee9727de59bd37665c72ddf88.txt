Removes the 5.3.3 version constant (#24833)

After releasing 5.3.2, the 5.3.3 version constant was created.  However,
this causes issues for the rolling upgrade tests, which expect to have
all older versions artifacts published and no point releases created off
of the older versions (older meaning more than one version behind the
current version).  This commit removes the 5.3.3 version constant,
assuming we will not need it anywhere.
