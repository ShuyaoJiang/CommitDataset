Add docs for cluster.remote.*.proxy setting (#40281)

In #33062 we introduced the `cluster.remote.*.proxy` setting for proxied
connections to remote clusters, but left it deliberately undocumented since it
needed followup work so that it could work with SNI. However, since #32517 is
now closed we can add this documentation and remove the comment about its lack
of documentation.
