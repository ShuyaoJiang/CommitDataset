Allow whitelist of packages that can exit

Today, SecureSM has a mechanism that enables a hardcoded list of test
packages to exit if the SecureSM instance is constructed with a boolean
flag indicating that these packages will be permitted to exit. This
commit replaces this mechanism by allowing the SecureSM instance to be
constructed with a whitelist of packages that can exit.
