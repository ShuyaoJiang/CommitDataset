Deprecate /_xpack/monitoring/* in favor of /_monitoring/* (#36130)

This commit is part of our plan to deprecate and ultimately remove the
use of _xpack in the REST APIs.

* Add deprecation for /_xpack/monitoring/_bulk in favor of /_monitoring/bulk
* Removed xpack from the rest-api-spec and tests
* Removed xpack from the Action name
* Removed MonitoringRestHandler as an unnecessary abstraction
* Minor corrections to comments

Relates #35958
