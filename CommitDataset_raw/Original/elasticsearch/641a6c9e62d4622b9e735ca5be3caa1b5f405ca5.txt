Guard accessDeclaredMembers for Tika on JDK 10

Tika parsers need accessDeclaredMembers because ZipFile needs
accessDeclaredMembers on JDK 10. This commit guards adding this
permission to parsers so that the permission is only granted on JDK
10. Additionally, we add an assertion that forces us to check if the
permission is still needed in JDK 11.
