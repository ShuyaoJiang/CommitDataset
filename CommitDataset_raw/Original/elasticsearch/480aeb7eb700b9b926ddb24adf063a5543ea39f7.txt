Introduce Gradle wrapper

We have agreed to introduce the Gradle wrapper to simplify workflows for
developers, and managing infrastructure (e.g., CI, release builds, etc.)
as well as consideration for the fact that other projects in our stack
use Gradle and do not necessarily want to be tied to our Gradle version.
