aggs: Add a method that is invoked before the `getLeafCollector(...)` of children aggregators is invoked.

In the case of nested aggregator this allows it to push down buffered child docs down to children aggregator.
Before this was done as part of the `NestedAggregator#getLeafCollector(...)`, but by then the children aggregators
have already moved on to the next segment and this causes incorrect results to be produced.

Closes #27912
