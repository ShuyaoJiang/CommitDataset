Add migration check for deprecated `delimited_payload_filter` (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4310)

Add a check to the migration assistant to warn about the renaming of
`delimited_payload_filter` to `delimited_payload`. This should still
word for old indices from 7.0 on but will throw an error for newly
created indices and the user should be warned about it when running the
migration checks.
