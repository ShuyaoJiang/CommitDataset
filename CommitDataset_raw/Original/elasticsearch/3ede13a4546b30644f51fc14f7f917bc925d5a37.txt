Test framework fall cleaning (#33423)

Wraps all lines in our test framework at 140 characters because that is
our standard line length and removes all of the checkstyle suppressions
for the test framework.

Drops most of `ModuleTestCase` because it isn't used and we're moving
away from using guice in the way that it wants to test anyway. Also
switches a few classes that extend it but don't use it to extend
`ESTestCase` instead.
