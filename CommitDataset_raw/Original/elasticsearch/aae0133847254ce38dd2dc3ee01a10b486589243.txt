[test] port linux package packaging tests (#31943)

Add packaging tests for the linux package distributions to the java test
project and remove them from bats. Most of the tests that lived in
30_deb_package.bats and 40_rpm_package.bats are applicable to both
package types and are combined into a single type of test case. Others
are separated out into separate cases to make their intent more clear
