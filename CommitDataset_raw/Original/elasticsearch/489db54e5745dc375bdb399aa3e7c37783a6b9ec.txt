Ignore numeric shard count if waiting for ALL (#31265)

Today, if GET /_cluster/health?wait_for_active_shards=all does not immediately
succeed then it throws an exception due to an erroneous and unnecessary call to
ActiveShardCount#enoughShardsActive(). This commit fixes this logic.

Fixes #31151
