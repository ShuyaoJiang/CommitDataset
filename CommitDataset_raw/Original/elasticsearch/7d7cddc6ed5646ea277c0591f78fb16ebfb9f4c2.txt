Watcher: Reenable HttpSecretsIntegrationTests#testWebhookAction test (#32456)

The error message mentioned in #30094 does not link to to a cause by the
test itself, as there are still inflight requests according to the
circuit breaker.

I ran this test class 100k times on bare metal and could not reproduce
it. I will reenable the test for now.

Closes #30094
