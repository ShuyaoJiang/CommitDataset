Fix SSLConfigurationReloaderTests failure tests (#39408)

This change fixes the tests that expect the reload of a
SSLConfiguration to fail. The tests relied on an incorrect assumption
that the reloader only called reload on for an SSLConfiguration if the
key and trust managers were successfully reloaded, but that is not the
case. This change removes the fail call with a wrapped call to the
original method and captures the exception and counts down a latch to
make these tests consistently tested.

Closes #39260
