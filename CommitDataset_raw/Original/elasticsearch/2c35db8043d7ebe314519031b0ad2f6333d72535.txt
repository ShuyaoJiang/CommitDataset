TEST: Avoid merges in testSeqNoAndCheckpoints

Since LUCENE-8263, testSeqNoAndCheckpoints might trigger merges because
of the updates and deletes in the test. Our merge scheduler will trigger
a flush if there is no pending merge. Those extra flushes will change
the last committed segmentInfos in the engine and fail the test.

This commit uses LogMergePolicy for the engine in the test to avoid
merges.

Closes #32430
