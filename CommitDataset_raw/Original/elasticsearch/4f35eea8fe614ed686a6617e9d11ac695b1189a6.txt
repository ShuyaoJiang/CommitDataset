[TEST] Fix testConcurrentTermIncreaseOnReplicaShard

This test has a bug that got introduced during the refactoring of #32442. With 2 concurrent term increments,
we can only assert under the operation permit that we are in the correct operation term, not that there is
not already another term bump pending.

Closes #34862
