Relax history check in ShardFollowTaskReplicationTests (#39162)

The follower won't always have the same history as the leader for its
soft-deletes retention can be different. However, if some operation
exists on the history of the follower, then the same operation must
exist on the leader. This change relaxes the history check in
ShardFollowTaskReplicationTests.
