Cascading primary failure lead to MSU too low (#40249)

If a replica were first reset due to one primary failover and then
promoted (before resync completes), its MSU would not include changes
since global checkpoint, leading to errors during translog replay.

Fixed by re-initializing MSU before restoring local history.
