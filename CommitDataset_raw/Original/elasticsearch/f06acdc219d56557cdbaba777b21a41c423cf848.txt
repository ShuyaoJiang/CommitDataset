[ML] Improve the way ML jobs are allocated to nodes (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2975)

This change modifies the way ML jobs are assigned to nodes to primarily
base the decision on the estimated memory footprint of the jobs. The
memory footprint comes from the model size stats if the job has been
running long enough, otherwise from the model memory limit. In addition,
an allowance for the program code and stack is added.

If insufficient information is available to base the allocation decision on
memory requirements then the decision falls back to using simple job
counts per node.
