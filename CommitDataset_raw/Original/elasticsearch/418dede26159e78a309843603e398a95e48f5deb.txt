 Enhance parsing of StatusCode in SAML Responses (#38628)

* Enhance parsing of StatusCode in SAML Responses

<Status> elements in a failed response might contain two nested
<StatusCode> elements. We currently only parse the first one in
order to create a message that we attach to the Exception we return
and log. However this is generic and only gives out informarion
about whether the SAML IDP believes it's an error with the
request or if it couldn't handle the request for other reasons. The
encapsulated StatusCode has a more interesting error message that
potentially gives out the actual error as in Invalid nameid policy,
authentication failure etc.

This change ensures that we print that information also, and removes
Message and Details fields from the message when these are not
part of the Status element (which quite often is the case)
