Aggregations bug: Significant_text fails on arrays of text. (#25030)

* Aggregations bug: Significant_text fails on arrays of text.
The set of previously-seen tokens in a doc was allocated per-JSON-field string value rather than once per JSON document meaning the number of docs containing a term could be over-counted leading to exceptions from the checks in significance heuristics. Added unit test for this scenario

Closes #25029
