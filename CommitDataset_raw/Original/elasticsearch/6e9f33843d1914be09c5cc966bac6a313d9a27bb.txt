stop throwing an IllegalStateException for unrecognized steps (#32212)

Since the reason for a step not being found in a registry may be due to staleness of the
registry between it and the cluster state, we do not want to throw an IllegalStateException.

Staleness is something that will be self-healing after follow-up applications of the cluster state
updates, so this is a recoverable issue that should log a warning instead of throwing an exception

Closes #32181.
