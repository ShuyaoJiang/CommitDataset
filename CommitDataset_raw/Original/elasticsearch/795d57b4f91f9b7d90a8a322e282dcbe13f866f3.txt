Auto configure all test tasks (#34666)

With this change, we apply the common test config automatically to all
newly created tasks instead of opting in specifically.

For plugin authors using the plugin externally this means that the
configuration will be applied to their RandomizedTestingTasks as well.

The purpose of the task is to simplify setup and make it easier to
change projects that use the `test` task but actually run integration
tests to use a task called `integTest` for clarity, but also because
we may want to configure and run them differently.
E.x. using different levels of concurrency.
