Move all sql integration tests into qa (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2432)

Builds on elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2403 to move all of sql's integration testing into
qa modules with different running server configurations. The
big advantage of this is that it allows us to test the cli and
jdbc with security present.

Creating a project that depends on both cli and jdbc and the
server has some prickly jar hell issues because cli and jdbc
package their dependencies in the jar. This works around it
in a few days:
1. Include only a single copy of the JDBC dependencies with
careful gradle work.
2. Do not include the CLI on the classpath at all and instead
run it externally.

I say "run it externally" rather than "fork it" because Elasticsearch
tests aren't allowed to fork other processes. This is forbidden
by seccomp on linux and seatbelt on osx and cannot be explicitly
requested like additional security manager settings. So instead
of forking the CLI process directly the tests interact with a test
fixture that isn't bound by Elasticsearch's rules and *can* fork
it.

This forking of the CLI has a nice side effect: it forces us to
make sure that things like security and connection strings other
than `localhost:9200` work. The old test could and did work around
missing features like that. The new tests cannot so I added the
ability to set the connection string. Configuring usernames and
passwords was also not supported but I did not add support for
that, only created the failing test and marked it as `@AwaitsFix`.
