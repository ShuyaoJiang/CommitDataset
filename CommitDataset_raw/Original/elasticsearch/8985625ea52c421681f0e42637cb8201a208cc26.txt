[Security] BulkShardRequest may have multiple indices (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2742)

If a bulk update references aliases rather than concrete indices,
it is possible that a single shard level request could have multiple distinct "index names", potentially including "date math".
Those names will resolve to the same concrete index, but they might have different privileges.
