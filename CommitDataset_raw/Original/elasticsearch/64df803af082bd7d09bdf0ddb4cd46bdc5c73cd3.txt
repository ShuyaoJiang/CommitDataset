Add a java level freeze/unfreeze API (#35353)

This change adds a high level freeze API that allows to mark an
index as frozen and vice versa. Indices must be closed in order to
become frozen and an open but frozen index must be closed to be
defrosted. This change also adds a index.frozen setting to
mark frozen indices and integrates the frozen engine with the
SearchOperationListener that resets and releases the directory
reader after and before search phases.
