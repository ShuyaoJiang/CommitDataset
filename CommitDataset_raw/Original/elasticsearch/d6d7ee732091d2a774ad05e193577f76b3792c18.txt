Remove FastCharArrayReader and FastCharArrayWriter (#28951)

These classes are used only in two places, and can be replaced by the
`CharArrayReader` and `CharArrayWriter`. The JDK can also perform lock biasing
and elision as well as escape analysis to optimize away non-contended locks,
rendering their lock-free implementations unnecessary.
