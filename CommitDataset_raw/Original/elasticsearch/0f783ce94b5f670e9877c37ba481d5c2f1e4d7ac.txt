Build: Stop double generating buildSrc pom (#32408)

When we added the `java-gradle-plugin` to `buildSrc` it added a second
task to generate the pom that duplicates the publishing work that we
configure in `BuildPlugin`. Not only does it dupliciate the pom, it
creates a pom that is missing things like `name` and `description` which
are required for publishing to maven central.

This change disables the duplicate pom generation.
