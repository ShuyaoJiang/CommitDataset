Fix handling of exceptions thrown on HEAD requests

Today when an exception is thrown handling a HEAD request, the body is
swallowed before the channel has a chance to see it. Yet, the channel is
where we compute the content length that would be returned as a header
in the response. This is a violation of the HTTP specification. This
commit addresses the issue. To address this issue, we remove the special
handling in bytes rest response for HEAD requests when an exception is
thrown. Instead, we let the upstream channel handle the special case, as
we already do today for the non-exceptional case.
