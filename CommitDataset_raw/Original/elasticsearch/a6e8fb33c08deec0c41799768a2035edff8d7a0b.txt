Docs: Remove unnecessary qualifier from wildcard import note (#34419)

This commit removes the suggestions to send a PR with instructions for
more IDEs on disabling wildcard imports. This is not explicitly needed
both because the main IDEs instructions already exist, and any part of
the docs are welcome for PRs to add more clarity.

closes #34415
