Improve error if Indices Permission is too complex (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4239)

If a user has roles that grant access to a large number of disparate
index patterns, then the resulting Automaton can become large and
too costly to determinise. This happens rarely, and is usually a sign
of a poorly implemented security model, so we have no immediate plans
to change the implementation. However the resulting error message is
not clear and does not provide sufficient information for users to
resolve the underlying problem.

This commit catches the underlying exception and provides a more
specific error message, with DEBUG logging of the offending index
patterns.
