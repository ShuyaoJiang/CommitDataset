[ML] Allow jobs in the "closing" state to be killed (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2026)

This is important for two reasons:

1. If a job hangs in the closing state for any reason there is now a
   way to get rid of it
2. The force delete endpoint (as used by the UI) killed open jobs before
   deleting them, but could not kill closing jobs, which created the
   possibility that if a job was deleted from the UI while in the closing
   state then the last few results could be indexed after the deletion
   completed
