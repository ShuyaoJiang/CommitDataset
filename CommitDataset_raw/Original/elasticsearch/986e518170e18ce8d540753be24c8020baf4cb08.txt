Store offsets in index prefix fields when stored in the parent field (#29067)

The index prefix field is normally indexed as docs-only, given that it cannot
be used in phrases.  However, in the case that the parent field has been indexed
with offsets, or has term-vector offsets, we should also store this in the index
prefix field for highlighting.

Note that this commit does not implement highlighting on prefix fields, but
rather ensures that future work can implement this without a backwards-break
in index data.

Closes #28994
