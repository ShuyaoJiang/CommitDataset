Rollback primary before recovering from translog  (#27804)

Today we always recover a primary from the last commit point. However 
with a new deletion policy, we keep multiple commit points in the
existing store, thus we have chance to find a good starting commit
point. With a good starting commit point, we may be able to throw away
stale operations. This PR rollbacks a primary to a starting commit then
recovering from translog.
