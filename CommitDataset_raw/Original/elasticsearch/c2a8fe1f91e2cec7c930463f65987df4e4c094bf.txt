Prevent CCR recovery from missing documents (#38237)

Currently the snapshot/restore process manually sets the global
checkpoint to the max sequence number from the restored segements. This
does not work for Ccr as this will lead to documents that would be
recovered in the normal followering operation from being recovered.

This commit fixes this issue by setting the initial global checkpoint to
the existing local checkpoint.
