Cross Cluster Search: do not use dedicated masters as gateways (#30926)

When we are connecting to a remote cluster we should never select
dedicated master nodes as gateway nodes, or we will end up loading them
with requests that should rather go to other type of nodes e.g. data
nodes or coord_only nodes.

This commit adds the selection based on the node role, to the existing
selection based on version and potential node attributes.

Closes #30687
