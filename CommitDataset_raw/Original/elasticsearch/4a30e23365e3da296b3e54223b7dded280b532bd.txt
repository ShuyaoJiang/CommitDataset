Remove QUERY_AND_FETCH BWC for pre-5.3.0 nodes (#25223)

* Remove QUERY_AND_FETCH BWC for pre-5.3.0 nodes

This was a BWC layer where we expicitly set the `search_type` to
"query_and_fetch" when a single node is queried on pre-5.3 nodes. Since 6.0 no
longer needs to be compatible with 5.3 nodes, this can be removed.

* Fix indentation

* Remove unused QUERY_FETCH_ACTION_NAME constant
