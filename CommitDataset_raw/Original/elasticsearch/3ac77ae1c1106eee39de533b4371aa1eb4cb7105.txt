add missing `test2` index in alias example (#39212)

* missing 'test2' index example (#39055)

If I got the idea of aliases properly, I think that the index "test2" should have a reference in the example above of the following sentence:

" ... we associate the alias `alias1` to both `test` and `test2` ... "

* add PUT test2

* Update aliases.asciidoc

swap which is write/read
