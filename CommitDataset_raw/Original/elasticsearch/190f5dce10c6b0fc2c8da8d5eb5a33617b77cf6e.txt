Test that gradle and Java version types match (#24943)

Both gradle and java code attempt to infer the type of a each
Version constant in Version.java. It is super important that
they infer that each constant has the same type. If they disagree
we might accidentally not be testing backwards compatibility for
some version.

This adds a test to make sure that they agree, modulo known and
accepted differences (mostly around alphas). It also changes the
minimum wire compatible version from the released 5.4.0 to the
unreleased 5.5.0 as that lines up with the gradle logic.

Relates to #24798 

Note that the gradle and java version logic doesn't actually match so
this contains a hack to make it *look* like it matches. Since this is a
start, I'm merging it and going to work on some followups to make the
logic actually match.....
