Lift retention lease expiration to index shard (#38380)

This commit lifts the control of when retention leases are expired to
index shard. In this case, we move expiration to an explicit action
rather than a side-effect of calling
ReplicationTracker#getRetentionLeases. This explicit action is invoked
on a timer. If any retention leases expire, then we hard sync the
retention leases to the replicas. Otherwise, we proceed with a
background sync.
