Fix potential race during TcpTransport close (#39031)

Fixed two potential causes for leaked threads during tests:
1. When adding a channel to serverChannels, we add it under a monitor
that we do not use when reading from it. This is potentially unsafe if
there is no other happens-before relationship ensuring the safety of
this.
2. Long-shot but if the thread pool was shutdown before entering this
code, we would silently forget about closing server channels so added
assert.

Strengthened the locking to ensure that once we stop the transport, no
new server channels can be made.
