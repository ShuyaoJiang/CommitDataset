Add tool to setup passwords for internal users (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1434)

This is related to elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1217. This change introduces a tool
bin/x-pack/setup-passwords that will streamline the setting of
internal user passwords. There are two modes of operation. One mode
called auto, automatically generates passwords and prints them to
the console. The second mode called interactive allows the user to 
enter passwords.

All passwords are changed using the elastic superuser. The elastic
password is the first password to be set.
