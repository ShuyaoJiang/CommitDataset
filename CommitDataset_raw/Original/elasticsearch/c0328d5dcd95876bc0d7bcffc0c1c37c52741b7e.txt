Fix timezone fallback in ingest processor (#38407)

If no timezone was specified in the date processor, then the conversion
would lead to wrong time, as UTC was assumed by default, leading to
incorrectly parsed dates.

This commit does not assume a default timezone and will thus not format
the dates in a wrong way.
