Move ObjectParser into the x-content lib (#29373)

* Move ObjectParser into the x-content lib

This moves `ObjectParser`, `AbstractObjectParser`, and
`ConstructingObjectParser` into the libs/x-content dependency. This decoupling
allows them to be used for parsing for projects that don't want to depend on the
entire Elasticsearch jar.
