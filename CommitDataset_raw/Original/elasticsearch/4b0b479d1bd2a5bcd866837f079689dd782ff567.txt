Build: Fix reproduce info for methods with ( or ) (#35712)

Our `REPRODUCE WITH` line wasn't working for tests with `(` or `)` in
the method name. This isn't super common, but happens sometimes for our
yml based rest tests. This is because randomized runner's globbing
mechanism dind't escape `(` or `)`. I filed this upstream at
https://github.com/randomizedtesting/randomizedtesting/issues/271
and Dawid kindly fixed the issue. This upgrades to pick up the fix.

Closes #35692
