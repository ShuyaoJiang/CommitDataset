Throw a better error message for empty field names (#26543)

* Throw a better error message for empty field names

When a document is parsed with a `""` for a field name, we currently throw a
confusing error about `.` being present in the field. This changes the error
message to be clearer about what's causing the problem.

Resolves #23348

* Fix exception message in test
