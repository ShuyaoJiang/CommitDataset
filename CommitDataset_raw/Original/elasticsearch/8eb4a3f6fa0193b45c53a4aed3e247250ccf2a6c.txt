Remove busted rolling upgrade script test

This commit removes a rolling upgrade test for scripting that is totally
busted yet is preventing builds from succeeding. We elect to remove this
test as opposed to skipping the test as:
 - it has beeen being skipped for months with no apparent loss
 - it appears to need significant work to get to an unbusted state
