[ML] Set established model memory on job open for pre-6.1 jobs (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3222)

Before this was done it was easy to get into the situation where a
job created in 5.x with a default model memory limit of 4GB could not
be opened on any node in the cluster.  Following this change this
problem will no longer occur for jobs that ran for a decent amount of
time on the old cluster.
