HLRC: Standardize access in *RequestConverters (#34768)

With the move to separate RequestConverters classes for each client,
some of the access restrictions on the new classes are more open than
the prior RequestConverters classes. This standardizes the
*RequestConverters classes as package-private, final, and with a private
constructor so that no instances of the can be inadvertently created.
