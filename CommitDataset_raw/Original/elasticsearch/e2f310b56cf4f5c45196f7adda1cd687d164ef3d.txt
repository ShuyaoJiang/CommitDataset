Fix AggregationFactories.Builder equality and hash regarding order (#34005)

Fixes the equals and hash function to ignore the order of aggregations to ensure equality after serialization
and deserialization. This ensures storing configs with aggregation works properly.

This also addresses a potential issue in caching when the same query contains aggregations but in 
different order. 1st it will not hit in the cache, 2nd cache objects which shall be equal might end up twice in 
the cache.
