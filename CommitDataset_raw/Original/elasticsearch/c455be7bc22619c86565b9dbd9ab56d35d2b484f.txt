[ML] Rename the json file structure to ndjson (#34901)

The file structure finder endpoint can find the NDJSON
(newline-delimited JSON) file format, but called it
`json`.  This change renames the `format` for this file
structure to `ndjson`, which is more precise and will
hopefully avoid confusion.
