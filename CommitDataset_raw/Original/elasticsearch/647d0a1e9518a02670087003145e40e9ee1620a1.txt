Do not swallow fail to convert exceptions (#29043)

When converting the source for an indexing request to JSON, the
conversion can throw an I/O exception which we swallow and proceed with
logging to the slow log. The cause of the I/O exception is lost. This
commit changes this behavior and chooses to drop the entry from the slow
logs and instead lets an exception percolate up to the indexing
operation listener loop. Here, the exception will be caught and logged
at the warn level.
