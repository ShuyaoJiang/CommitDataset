 Transition transport apis to use void listeners (#27440)

Currently we use ActionListener<TcpChannel> for connect, close, and send
message listeners in TcpTransport. However, all of the listeners have to
capture a reference to a channel in the case of the exception api being
called. This commit changes these listeners to be type <Void> as passing
the channel to onResponse is not necessary. Additionally, this change
makes it easier to integrate with low level transports (which use
different implementations of TcpChannel).
