Watcher: Fix TransformInput toXContent serialization (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4061)

The toXContent serialization of the transform input was broken, which
could lead to the bad case that a watch could be stored with an invalid
toXContent serialization, that could not be read again, when the watch
should either be executed or even just returned by the Get watch API.
