Avoid stack overflow on search phases

When a search is executing locally over many shards, we can stack
overflow during query phase execution. This happens due to callbacks
that occur after a phase completes for a shard and we move to the same
phase on another shard. If all the shards for the query are local to the
local node then we will never go async and these callbacks will end up
as recursive calls. With sufficiently many shards, this will end up as a
stack overflow. This commit addresses this by truncating the stack by
forking to another thread on the executor for the phase.
