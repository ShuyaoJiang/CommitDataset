High-level client: list tasks failure to not lose nodeId (#31001)

This commit reworks testing for `ListTasksResponse` so that random
fields insertion can be tested and xcontent equivalence can be checked
too. Proper exclusions need to be configured, and failures need to be
tested separately. This helped finding a little problem, whenever there
is a node failure returned, the nodeId was lost as it was never printed
out as part of the exception toXContent.
