LLREST: Introduce a strict mode (#33708)

Introduces `RestClientBuilder#setStrictDeprecationMode` which defaults
to false but when set to true, causes a rest request to fail if a
deprecation warning header comes back in the response from Elasticsearch.
This should be valueable to Elasticsearch's tests, especially those of the
High Level REST Client where they will help catch divergence between the
client and the server.
