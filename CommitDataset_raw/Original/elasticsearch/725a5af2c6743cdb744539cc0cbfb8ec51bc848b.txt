_cluster/state should always return cluster_uuid (#30143)

Currently, the only way to get the REST response for the `/_cluster/state`
call to return the `cluster_uuid` is to request the `metadata` metrics,
which is one of the most expensive response structures. However, external
monitoring agents will likely want the `cluster_uuid` to correlate the
response with other API responses whether or not they want cluster
metadata.
