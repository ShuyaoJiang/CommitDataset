Forbid trappy methods from java.time (#28476)

ava.time has the functionality needed to deal with timezones with varying 
offsets correctly, but it also has a bunch of methods that silently let you
forget about the hard cases, which raises the risk that we'll quietly do the
wrong thing at some point in the future.

This change adds the trappy methods to the list of forbidden methods to try and
help stop this from happening.

It also fixes the only use of these methods in the codebase so far:
IngestDocument#deepCopy() used ZonedDateTime.of() which may alter the offset of
the given time in cases where the offset is ambiguous.
