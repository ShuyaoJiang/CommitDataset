Stop sourcing scripts during installation/removal (#28918)

Previously we allowed a lot of customization of Elasticsearch during
package installation (e.g., the username and group). This customization
was achieved by sourcing the env script (e.g.,
/etc/sysconfig/elasticsearch) during installation. Since we no longer
allow such flexibility, we do not need to source these env scripts
during package installation and removal.
