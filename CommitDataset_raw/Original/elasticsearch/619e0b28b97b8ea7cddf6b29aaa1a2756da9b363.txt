Add hook to skip asserting x-content equivalence (#33114)

This commit adds a hook to AbstractSerializingTestCase to enable
skipping asserting that the x-content of the test instance and an
instance parsed from the x-content of the test instance are the
same. While we usually expect these to be the same, they will not be the
same when exceptions are involved because the x-content there is lossy.
