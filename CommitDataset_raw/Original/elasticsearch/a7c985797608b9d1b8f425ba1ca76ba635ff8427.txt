 Fix binary doc values fetching in _search (#29567)

Binary doc values are retrieved during the DocValueFetchSubPhase through an instance of ScriptDocValues.
Since 6.0 ScriptDocValues instances are not allowed to reuse the object that they return (https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/26775) but BinaryScriptDocValues doesn't follow this restriction and reuses instances of BytesRefBuilder among different documents.
This results in `field` values assigned to the wrong document in the response.
This commit fixes this issue by recreating the BytesRef for each value that needs to be returned.

 Fixes #29565
