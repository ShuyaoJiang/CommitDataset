Document and test date_range "missing" support (#28983)

* Add a REST integration test that documents date_range support

Add a test case that exercises date_range aggregations using the missing
option.

Addresses #17597

* Test cleanup and correction

Adding a document with a null date to exercise `missing` option, update
test name to something reasonable.

* Update documentation to explain how the "missing" parameter works for
date_range aggregations.

* Wrap lines at 80 chars in docs.

* Change format of test to YAML for readability.
