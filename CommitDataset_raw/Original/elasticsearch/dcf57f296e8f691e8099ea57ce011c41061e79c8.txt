Fix get mappings HEAD requests

Get mappings HEAD requests incorrectly return a content-length header of
0. This commit addresses this by removing the special handling for get
mappings HEAD requests, and just relying on the general mechanism that
exists for handling HEAD requests in the REST layer.
