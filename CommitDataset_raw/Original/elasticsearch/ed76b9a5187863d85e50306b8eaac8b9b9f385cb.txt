Test: allow setting socket timeout for rest client (#25221)

In #25201, a setting was added to allow setting the retry timeout for the rest client under the
impression that this would allow requests to go longer than 30s. However, there is also a socket
timeout that needs to be set to greater than 30s, which this change adds a setting for.
