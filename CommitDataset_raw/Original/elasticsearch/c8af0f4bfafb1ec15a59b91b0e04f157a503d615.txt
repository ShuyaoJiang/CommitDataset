Use mappings to format doc-value fields by default. (#30831)

Doc-value fields now return a value that is based on the mappings rather than
the script implementation by default.

This deprecates the special `use_field_mapping` docvalue format which was added
in #29639 only to ease the transition to 7.x and it is not necessary anymore in
7.0.
