Fix CCR tests that manipulate transport requests

We have some CCR tests where we use mock transport send rules to control
the behavior that we desire in these tests. Namely, we want to simulate
an exception being thrown on the leader side, or a variety of other
situations. These send rules were put in place between the data nodes on
each side. However, it might not be the case that these requests are
being sent between data nodes. For example, a request that is handled on
a non-data master node would not be sent from a data node. And it might
not be the case that the request is sent to a data node, as it could be
proxied through a non-data coordinating node. This commit addresses this
by putting these send rules in places between all nodes on each side.
