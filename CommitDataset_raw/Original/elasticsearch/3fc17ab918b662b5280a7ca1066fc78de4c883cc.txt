Audit Event ignore policy (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3005)

This commit introduces audit event filtering policies for the logging audit.
Until now the only way to temper the gush of audit events was to specifically
pick some event types that were reported.
This superposes a way (named policies) to filter events using lucene regexp filters on 
the following event fields: users, realms, roles and indices. The policies are ignore
policies, ie when an event matches it is ignored (not reported).
