Add sequence numbers based optimistic concurrency control support to Engine (#36467)

This commit add support to engine operations for resolving and verifying the sequence number and
primary term of the last modification to a document before performing an operation. This is
infrastructure to move our (optimistic concurrency control)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control] API to use sequence numbers instead of internal versioning.
