SQL: Document a few functions (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3390)

* Starts to build the list of supported functions, adding links to
wikipedia when there is any doubt what the functions mean.
* Extracts an example of using the function from the test suite.
* Explicitly calls out how we round (half up) because there are
lots of ways to round.
