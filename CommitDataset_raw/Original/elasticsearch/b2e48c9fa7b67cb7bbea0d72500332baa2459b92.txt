Support RequestedAuthnContext (#31238)

* Support RequestedAuthnContext

This implements limited support for RequestedAuthnContext by :
- Allowing SP administrators to define a list of authnContextClassRef
to be included in the RequestedAuthnContext of a SAML Authn Request
- Veirifying that the authnContext in the incoming SAML Asertion's
AuthnStatement contains one of the requested authnContextClassRef
- Only EXACT comparison is supported as the semantics of validating
the incoming authnContextClassRef are deployment dependant and
require pre-established rules for MINIMUM, MAXIMUM and BETTER

Also adds necessary AuthnStatement validation as indicated by [1] and
[2]
