DOCS: Add password_hash & refresh to Put User API (#35574)

PR #35242 formalised support for the password_hash field in the body
of the Put User security API.
Since this field is now validated and tested, it can also be
documented.

The Put User API also supports a "refresh" query parameter that was
not documented. This commit adds it to the docs.
