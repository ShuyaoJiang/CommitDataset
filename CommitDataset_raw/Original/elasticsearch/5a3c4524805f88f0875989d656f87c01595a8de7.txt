Align docs etc with new discovery setting names (#38492)

In #38333 and #38350 we moved away from the `discovery.zen` settings namespace
since these settings have an effect even though Zen Discovery itself is being
phased out. This change aligns the documentation and the names of related
classes and methods with the newly-introduced naming conventions.
