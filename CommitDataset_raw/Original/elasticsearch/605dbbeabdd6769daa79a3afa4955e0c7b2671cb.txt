Remove trial status info from start trial doc (#31365)

This is related to #31325. There is currently information about the
get-trial-status api on the start-trial api documentation page. It also
has the incorrect route for that api. This commit removes that
information as the start-trial page properly links to a page providing
documenation about get-trial-status.
