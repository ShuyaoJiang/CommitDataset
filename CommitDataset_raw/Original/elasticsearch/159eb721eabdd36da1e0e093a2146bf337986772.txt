Return cached segments stats if `include_unloaded_segments` is true (#39698)

Today we don't return segments stats for closed indices which makes it
hard to tell how much memory such an index would require. With this change
we return the statistics if requested by setting `include_unloaded_segments` to
true on the rest request.
