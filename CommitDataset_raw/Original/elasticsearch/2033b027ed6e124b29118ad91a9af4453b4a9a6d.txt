Tests: Ensure watcher is enabled/disabled during tests (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2392)

The method to check if watcher was enabled was returning
`randomBoolean()` and thus could change during test runs.

This fixes the test to ensure that always the same value
is returned and documents this requirement.
