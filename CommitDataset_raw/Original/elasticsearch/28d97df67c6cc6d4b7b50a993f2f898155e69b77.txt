Add document count to Matrix Stats aggregation response (#24776)

This commit adds a `doc_count` field to the response body of Matrix
Stats aggregation. It exposes the number of documents involved in
 the computation of statistics, a value that can already be retrieved using
  the method MatrixStats.getDocCount() in the Java API.
