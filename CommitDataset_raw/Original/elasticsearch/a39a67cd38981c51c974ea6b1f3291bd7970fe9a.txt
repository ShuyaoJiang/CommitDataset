[ML] Extract common native process base class (#34856)

We currently have two different native processes:
autodetect & normalizer. There are plans for introducing
a new process. All these share many things in common.
This commit refactors the processes to extend an
`AbstractNativeProcess` class that encapsulates those
commonalities with the purpose of reusing the code
for new processes in the future.
