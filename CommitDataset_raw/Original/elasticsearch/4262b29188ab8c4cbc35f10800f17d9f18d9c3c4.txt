[Security] Add DEBUG logging on role resolution (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3138)

This change adds some debug and trace logging when we look up role names, to explain how each role was resolved.

At the moment we have very little insight into how roles are being resolved which can make it difficult to diagnose some issues.
