Add OS/architecture classifier to distributions (#37881)

This commit adds classifiers to the distributions indicating the
OS (for archives) and platform. The current OSes are for windows, darwin (ie
macos) and linux. This change will allow future OS/architecture specific
changes to the distributions. Note the docs using distribution links
have been updated, but will be reworked in a followup to make OS
specific instructions for the archives.
