[Security] Fix concrete security index name  (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2905)

The 5.6 Upgrade API will reindex .security to .security-6 and create a .security alias.
But the 6.0 default was to create a .security-v6 index and a .security alias if none existed (e.g. fresh x-pack install)

Having two different index names based on the method of install/upgrade complicates the code and testing, so we're unifying on the .security-6 index name that already exists in the wild.
