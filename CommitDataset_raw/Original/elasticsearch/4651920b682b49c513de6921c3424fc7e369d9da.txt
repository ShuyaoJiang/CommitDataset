Remove extraneous quotes from Windows env script

We quoted some strings in the Windows elasticsearch-env script but echo
on Windows includes these quotes in the output. This commit removes
these quotes, they do not need to be output and are noise. Note that one
of the commands is wrapped in parentheses, this is to make obvious that
the space at the end of the corresponding line is intentionally there.
