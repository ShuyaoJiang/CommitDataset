[ML] Rename input_fields to column_names in file structure (#33568)

This change tightens up the meaning of the "input_fields" field
in the file structure finder output.  Previously it was permitted
but not calculated for JSON and XML files.  Following this change
the field is called "column_names" and is only permitted for
delimited files.

Additionally the way the column names are set for headerless
delimited files is refactored to encapsulate the way they're
named to one line of the code rather than having the same
logic in two places.
