Move top-level pipeline aggs out of QuerySearchResult (#40319)

As part of #40177 we have added top-level pipeline aggs to
`InternalAggregations`. Given that `QuerySearchResult` holds an
`InternalAggregations` instance, there is no need to keep on setting
top-level pipeline aggs separately. Top-level pipeline aggs can then
always be transported through `InternalAggregations`. Such change is
made in a backwards compatible manner.
