Reinstate recommendation for â‰¥ 3 master-eligible nodes. (#27204)

In the docs for 1.7 ([doc][doc-1.7], [src][src-1.7]) there was a recommendation
for at least 3 master-eligible nodes "in critical clusters" but this was lost
when that page was updated in 2.0 ([doc][doc-2.0], [src][src-2.0]). I'd like to
reinstate this.
