[ML] Make get_job_stats robust to missing results indices (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1662)

Although the job stats for jobs with missing results indices are clearly
ruined, it's better to provide zeroes for the missing values and show the
stats for other jobs than to fail the whole request. This means the UI
can continue to function.
