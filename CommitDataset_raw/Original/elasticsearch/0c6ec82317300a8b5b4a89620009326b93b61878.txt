Grant Netty necessary permissions

When using the security networking implementations, the Netty jars that
are in play are those that are loaded in the X-Pack classloader. This
means that permissions granted to the Netty jars loaded in the
transport-netty4 module classloader do nothing. Instead, we have to
grant the same permissions to the Netty jars in the X-Pack
classloader. This commit does this.
