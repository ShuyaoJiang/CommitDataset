Rework bwc snapshot projects to build up to two bwc versions (#24870)

Removes the `distribution:bwc` project in favor of
`distribution:bwc-release-snapshot` and
`distribution:bwc-stable-snapshot`.
`distribution:bwc-release-snapshot` builds a snapshot of the
latest release branch (5.4 now) if needed for backwards
compatibility. `distribution:bwc-stable-snapshot` builds a
snapshot of the latest stable branch (5.x now) if needed for
backwards compatibility.
