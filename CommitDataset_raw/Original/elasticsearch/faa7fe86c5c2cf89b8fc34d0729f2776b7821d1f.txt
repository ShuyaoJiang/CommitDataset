Introduce analyze thread pool (#29541)

We want to remove the index thread pool as it is no longer needed since
single-document indexing requests are executed as bulk requests
now. Analyze requests are also executed on the index thread pool though
and they need a thread pool to execute on. The bulk thread does not seem
like the right thread pool, let us keep that thread pool conceptually
for bulk requests and free for bulk requests. None of the existing
thread pools make sense for analyze requests either. The generic thread
pool would be a terrible choice since it has an unbounded queue and that
is a bad idea for user-facing APIs. This commit introduces a small by
default (size=1, queue_size=16) thread pool for analyze requests.
