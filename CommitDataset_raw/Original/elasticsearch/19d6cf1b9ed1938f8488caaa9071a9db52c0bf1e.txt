[CCR] Change response classes to not use from Streamable. (#35085)

Only the response classes of get auto follow pattern, the follow and stats APIs
were moved away from Streamable.  The other APIs use `AcknowledgedResponse`
or `BaseTasksResponse` as response class and
moving that class away from Streamable is a bigger change.
