Filter pre-6.0 nodes for checkpoint invariants

When checking that the global checkpoint on the primary is consistent
with the local checkpoints of the in-sync shards, we have to filter
pre-6.0 nodes from the check or the invariant will trivially trip. This
commit filters these nodes out when checking this invariant.
