SQL: Introduce INTERVAL support (#35521)

Introduce INTERVAL as a DataType
Add INTERVAL to the grammar which supports the standard SQL declaration
 (without precision):
 > INTERVAL '1 23:45:01.123456789' DAY TO SECOND
 but also number for single unit intervals:
 > INTERVAL 1 YEAR
 as well as the plurals of the units:
 > INTERVAL 2 YEARS
Interval are internally supported as just another Literal being backed
 by java.time.Period and java.time.Duration
Move JDBC away from JDBCType enum to SQLType interface
Refactor DataType by moving it into server core and adding dedicated (and
 much simpler) JDBC driver type
Improve internal JDBC conversion by normalizing on the DataType
Rename JDBC columnInfo to JdbcColumnInfo to differentiate between it and
 the SQL ColumnInfo
