[DOCS] Clarify expected availability of HDFS for the HDFS Repository (#25220)

If a cluster is configured with an HDFS repository and a node is started, that node must be able 
to reach HDFS, or else when it attempts to add the repository from the cluster state at start up 
it will fail to connect and the repository will be left in an inconsistent state. Adding a blurb in the 
docs to outline the expected availability for HDFS when using the repository plugin.
