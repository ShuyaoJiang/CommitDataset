Watcher: Never return credentials after watch creation... (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3581)

... yet support updates. This commit introduces a few changes of how
watches are put.

The GET Watch API will never return credentials like basic auth
passwords, but a placeholder instead now. If the watcher is enabled to
encrypt sensitive settings, then the original encrypted value is
returned otherwise a "::es_redacted::" place holder.

There have been several Put Watch API changes.

The API now internally uses the Update API and versioning. This has
several implications. First if no version is supplied, we assume an
initial creation. This will work as before, however if a credential is
marked as redacted we will reject storing the watch, so users do not
accidentally store the wrong watch.

The watch xcontent parser now has an additional methods to tell the
caller if redacted passwords have been found. Based on this information
an error can be thrown.

If the user now wants to store a watch that contains a password marked
as redacted, this password will not be part of the toXContent
representation of the watch and in combinatination with update request
the existing password will be merged in. If the encrypted password is
supplied this one will be stored.

The serialization for GetWatchResponse/PutWatchRequest has changed.
The version checks for this will be put into the 6.x branch.

The Watcher UI now needs specify the version, when it wants to store a
watch. This also prevents last-write-wins scenarios and is the reason
why the put/get watch response now contains the internal version.
