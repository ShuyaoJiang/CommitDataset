Add upper limit for scroll expiry (#26448)

This change adds a dynamic cluster setting named `search.max_keep_alive`.
It is used as an upper limit for scroll expiry time in scroll queries and defaults to 1 hour.
This change also ensures that the existing setting `search.default_keep_alive` is always smaller than `search.max_keep_alive`.
