Remove Comparable interface from ScoreAccessor (#35519)

The way ScoreAccessor implements `compareTo()` is problematic because it doesn't
completely follow the Comparable contract, specificaly symmetry (if x is a
ScoreAccessor and y any Number then x.comparTo(y) works, but y.compareTo(x)
generally does not even compile). Fortunately we don't seem to use the fact that
ScoreAccessor is a Comparable anywhere, so we can simply remove it.
