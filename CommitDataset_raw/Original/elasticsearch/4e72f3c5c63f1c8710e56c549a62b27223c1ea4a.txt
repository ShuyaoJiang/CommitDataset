DedicatedClusterSnapshotRestoreIT to Zen2 (#37489)

All tests except testRestorePersistentSettings (renamed to
testExceptionWhenRestoringPersistentSettings) worked fine.
testExceptionWhenRestoringPersistentSettings re-written to use a custom
setting, because "minimum master node" setting is no longer available
in Zen2. It turns out there is no good replacement for "minimum master
node" setting for this test, that's why the custom setting is
introduced.

Unfortunately, there is #37485 bug and currently
RestoreService does not perform setting validation. That's why the
test is annotated with @AwaitsFix, the idea is to merge this commit and
then fix the issue and enable the test. (The test passes with a simple
fix, that adds a single line to RestoreService).
