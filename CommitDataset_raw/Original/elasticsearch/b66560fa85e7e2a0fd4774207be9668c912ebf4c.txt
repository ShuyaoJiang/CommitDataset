[TEST] Use better REST endpoints for testing watch actions

This is the x-pack side of https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/24437

It changes two things, for the disable tests, it uses a valid endpoint instead
of a previously invalid endpoint that happened to return a 400 because the
endpoint was bad, regardless of if watcher was disabled.

The other change is to create the watches index by putting a watch using the
correct API, rather than manually creating the index. This is because
`RestHijackOperationAction` hijacks operations like this and stops accessing the
endpoint in a regular manner.
