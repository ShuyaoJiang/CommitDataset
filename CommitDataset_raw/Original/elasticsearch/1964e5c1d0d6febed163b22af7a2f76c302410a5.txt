Test: Make mixed cluster bwc test per wire compat version (#24780)

This commit renames the backwards-5.0 qa test to mixed-cluster and
creates a test within the project per wire compat version. Like with
rolling upgrade tests, the integTest task will run against the most
recent version, while all versions will be tested with the bwcTest task.
