Migrate muted auto follow rolling upgrade test and unmute this test (#38900)

The rest of `CCRIT` is now no longer relevant, because the remaining
test tests the same of the index following test in the rolling upgrade
multi cluster module.

Added `tests.upgrade_from_version` version to test. It is not needed
in this branch, but is in 6.7 branch.

Closes #37231
