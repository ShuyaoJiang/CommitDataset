Fix java time formatters that round up (#37604)

In order to be able to parse epoch seconds and epoch milli seconds own
java time fields had been introduced. These fields are however not
compatible with the way that java time allows one to configure default
fields (when a part of a timestamp cannot be read then a default value
is added), which is used for the formatters that are rounding up to the
next value.

This commit allows java date formatters to configure its round up parsing 
by setting default values via a consumer. By default all formats are setting 
JavaDateFormatter.ROUND_UP_BASE_FIELDS for rounding up. The epoch
however parsers both need to set different fields. The merged date
formatters do not set any fields, they just append all the round up formatters.

Also the formatter now properly copies the locale and the timezone, 
fractional parsing has been set to nano seconds with proper width.
