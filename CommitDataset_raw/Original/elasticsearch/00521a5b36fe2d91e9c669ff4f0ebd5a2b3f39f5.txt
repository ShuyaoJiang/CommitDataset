Watcher: Ensure all internal search requests count hits (#36697)

In previous commits only the stored toXContent version of a search
request was using the old format. However an executed search request was
already disabling hit counts. In 7.0 hit counts will stay enabled by
default to allow for proper migration.

Closes #36177
