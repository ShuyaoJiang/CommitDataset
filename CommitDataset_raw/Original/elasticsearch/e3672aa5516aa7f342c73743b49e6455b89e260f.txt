Tests: disable testRandomGeoCollectionQuery on tiny polygons (#37579)

Due to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-8634 this test
may fail if a really tiny polygon is generated. This commit checks for
tiny polygons and skips the final check, which is expected to fail
until the lucene bug is fixed and new version of lucene is released.
