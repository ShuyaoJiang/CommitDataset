Watcher: Return useful error message when no accounts are found (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2897)

When there were no accounts configured, watcher returned a cryptic
error message containing 'null' in the description. This fix returns
a more clear error message.

On top a dedicated NotificationServiceTests class was added to remove
redundant test cases in the hipchat/jira/slack unit tests, that all
basically tested NotificationService capabilties.
