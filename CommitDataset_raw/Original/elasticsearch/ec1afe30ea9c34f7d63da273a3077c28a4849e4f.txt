Ensure remote cluster alias is preserved in inner hits aggs (#25627)

We lost the cluster alias due to some special caseing in inner hits
and due to the fact that we didn't pass on the alias to the shard request.
This change ensures that we have the cluster alias present on the shard to
ensure all SearchShardTarget reads preserve the alias.
