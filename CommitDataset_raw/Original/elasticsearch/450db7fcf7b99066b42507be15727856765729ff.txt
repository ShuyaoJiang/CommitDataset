[Tests] Fix slowness of AutoDateHistogramAggregatorTests (#35072)

Randomize test assertion and test set size instead of asserting on an
exhaustive list of dates with fixed test set size. Also refactor common 
objects used to avoid recreating them, avoid date to string conversion
and reduce duplicate test code

Closes #33181
