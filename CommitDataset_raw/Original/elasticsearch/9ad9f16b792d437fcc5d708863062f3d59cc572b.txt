Remove some abstractions from `TransportReplicationAction` (#40706)

`TransportReplicationAction` is a rather complex beast, and some of its
concrete implementations do not need all of its features. More specifically, it
(a) chases a primary around the cluster until it manages to pin it down and
then (b) executes an action on that primary and all its replicas. There are
some actions that are coordinated by the primary itself, meaning that there is
no need for the chase-the-primary phases, and in the case of peer recovery
retention leases and primary/replica resync it is important to bypass these
first phases.

This commit is a step towards separating the `TransportReplicationAction` into
these two parts. It is a mostly mechanical sequence of steps to remove some
abstractions that are no longer in use.
