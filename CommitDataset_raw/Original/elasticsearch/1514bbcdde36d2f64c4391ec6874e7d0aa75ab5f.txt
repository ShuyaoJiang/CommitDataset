Security: propagate auth result to listeners (#36900)

After #30794, our caching realms limit each principal to a single auth
attempt at a time. This prevents hammering of external servers but can
cause a significant performance hit when requests need to go through a
realm that takes a long time to attempt to authenticate in order to get
to the realm that actually authenticates. In order to address this,
this change will propagate failed results to listeners if they use the
same set of credentials that the authentication attempt used. This does
prevent these stalled requests from retrying the authentication attempt
but the implementation does allow for new requests to retry the
attempt.
