Reindex: Fold "with all deps" project into reindex (#30154)

This folds the `:qa:smoke-test-reindex-with-all-modules` project into
`:modules:reindex` by declaring the reindex's integration testing
cluster requires the `parent-join` and `lang-painless` plugins and then
moving all of the integration tests that depended on parent-join and
painless into reindex.

It saves us one cluster start up during the build at the cost of a
little of the reindex module's "purity". Since the reindex module *does*
have unit tests that test scripting without painless I'm fairly ok with
that.
