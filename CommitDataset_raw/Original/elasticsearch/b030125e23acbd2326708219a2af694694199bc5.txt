Build Docker images if the binary exists (#36459)

This commit changes the Docker assemble tasks so that they attempt to
build Docker if the Docker binaries exist, of if build.docker is set to
true. If the Docker binaries do not exist, or if build.docker is set to
false, then no attempt is made to build the Docker images.
