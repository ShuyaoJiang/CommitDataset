[Test] Reduce number of buckets in SearchResponseTests and AggregationsTests (#24964)

This commit reduces the number of buckets that are generated for multi
 bucket aggregations in AggregationsTests and SearchResponseTests.

 The number of buckets are now limited to a maximum of 3 but before some
 aggregations could generate up to 10 buckets.
