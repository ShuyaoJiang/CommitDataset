Fix handling of fractional time value settings (#37171)

This commit addresses an issue when setting a time value setting using a
value that has a fractional component when converted to its string
representation. For example, trying to set a time value setting to a
value of 1500ms is problematic because internally this is converted to
the string "1.5s". When we go to get this setting, we try to parse
"1.5s" back to a time value, which does not support fractional
values. The problem is that internally we are relying on a method which
loses the unit when doing the string conversion. Instead, we are going
to use a method that does not lose the unit and therefore we can
roundtrip from the time value to the string and back to the time value.
