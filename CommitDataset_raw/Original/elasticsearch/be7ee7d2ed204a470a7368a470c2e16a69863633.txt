[ML] Fix race condition when creating multiple jobs (#40049)

If multiple jobs are created together and the anomaly
results index does not exist then some of the jobs could
fail to update the mappings of the results index. This
lead them to fail to write their results correctly later.

Although this scenario sounds rare, it is exactly what
happens if the user creates their first jobs using the
Nginx module in the ML UI.

This change fixes the problem by updating the mappings
of the results index if it is found to exist during a
creation attempt.

Fixes #38785
