Extend testing of build method in ScriptSortBuilder (#26520)

Improve testing around the ScriptSortBuilder#build method, adding checks for
correct transfers of the sort mode and nested sorts.

Also changing the behaviour around the nested_path, nested_filter vs. nested
parameter in a similar way as in #26490 and deprecating the setters/getters for
the old syntax.

Closes #17286
