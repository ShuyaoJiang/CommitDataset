Replace log4j.Supplier by jdkâ€™s in non-logging usage (#28812)

This commit replaces `org.apache.logging.log4j.util.Supplier` by
`java.util.function.Supplier` in non-logging code. These usages are
neither incorrect nor wrong but rather than accidental. I think our
intention was to use the JDK's Supplier in these places.
