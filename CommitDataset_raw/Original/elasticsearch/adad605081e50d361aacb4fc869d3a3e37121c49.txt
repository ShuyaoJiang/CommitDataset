[Tests] Improve testing of FieldSortBuilder (#26437)

Currently we don't have much unit testing about the SortField that is created then
calling the SortBuilders `build` method. Most of this is covered by integration tests
somewhere but it would be good to have some basic checks in FieldSortBuilderTest
as well.

This adds testing for the sort order, mode, missing values and checks that `nested` 
gets set in the XFieldComparatorSource when `nestedPath` and `nestedFilter` are 
set on the builder.

Relates to #17286
