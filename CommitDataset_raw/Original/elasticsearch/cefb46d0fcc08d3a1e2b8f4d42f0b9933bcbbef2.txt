Throw UOE from compressible bytes stream reset

A compressible bytes output stream is a stream output which supports a
reset method. However, compressible bytes output streams are unusual in
that the current implementation sometimes supports a reset (if the
stream is not compressed) and sometimes does not support a rest (if the
stream is compressed). This inconsistent behavior is puzzling and
instead we should simply always throw an unsupported operation
exception.
