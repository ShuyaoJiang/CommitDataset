Share common parser in some AcknowledgedResponses (#31169)

Several AcknowledgedResponse implementations only parse the boolean acknowledged
flag and then create an instance of their class using that flag. This can be
simplified by adding this basic parser to the superclass, provide a common
helper method and call the appropriate ctor in the fromXContent methods.
