[TEST] skips shrink source mapping rest test

This change skips the rest test in `rest-api-spec/test/indices.shrink/20_source_mapping.yml` as it currently fails because if we don’t expect the deprecation warning the normal rest tests fail because they get a warning they don’t expect but if we do expect the deprecation warning the mixed cluster tests fail because they don’t get a warning which they expected.
