SQL: Fix SSL for JDBC and CLI for real this time (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3277)

Previously I'd added tests for JDBC and CLI that I *thought* used SSL but they didn't! I wasn't careful...

Testing changes:
* Actually enable SSL/HTTPS in the `qa:sql:security:ssl` subproject.
* Rework how `RemoteCli` handles security. This allows us to configure SSL, the keystore, and the username and password in a much less error prone way.
* Fix up JDBC tests to properly use SSL.
* Allow the `CliFixture` to specify the keystore location.
* Switch `CliFixture` and `RemoteCli` from sending the password in the connection string to filling out the prompt for it.
* Have `CliFixture` also send the keystore password when a keystore is configured.

This makes the following production code changes:
* Allow the CLI to configure the keystore location with the `-k`/`-keystore_location` parameters.
* If the keystore location is configured then the CLI will prompt for the password.
* Allow the configuration of urls starting with `https`.
* Improve the exception thrown when the URL doesn't parse by adding a suppressed exception with the original parse error, before we tried to add `http://` to the front of it.
