Adjust log and unmute testFailOverOnFollower (#38762)

There were two documents (seq=2 and seq=103) missing on the follower in
one of the failures of `testFailOverOnFollower`. I spent several hours
on that failure but could not figure out the reason. I adjust log and
unmute this test so we can collect more information.
