Simplify Azure blobStore method signatures (#26752)

While working on #26751, I found that we are passing the container name on every single method although we don't need it as it is stored within the blobstore object already.

This commit simplifies a bit that part of the code.

It also removes `repositoryName` from AzureBlobStore which was not used anymore.
Also we move some properties in AzureBlobContainer to `private` members.
