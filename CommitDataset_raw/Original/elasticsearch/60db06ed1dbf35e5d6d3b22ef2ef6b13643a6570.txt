[ILM] refactor ExplainLifecycleRequest to enforce indices (#35753)

Previously, it was possible to initialize a request
that does not include any indices. This results in undefined
behavior when generating the URL path to send to ES. By
enforcing indices to be defined, users will be more explicit
about the intention.
