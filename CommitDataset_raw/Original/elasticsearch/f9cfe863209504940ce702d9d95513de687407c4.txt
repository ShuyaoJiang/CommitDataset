Make RemoteClusterConnectionTests more robust against cancelable threads aborts

Today we assert hart if failure listeners are invoked more than once. Yet, this
can happen if we cancel the execution since the caller and the handler will get
the exception on the cancelable threads and will notify the listener concurrently
if timinig allows. This commit relaxes the assertion towards handling multiple
invocations with `ExecutionCancelledException`
