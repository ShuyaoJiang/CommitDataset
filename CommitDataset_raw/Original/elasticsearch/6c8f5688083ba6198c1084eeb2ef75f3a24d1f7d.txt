Switch remaining LLREST usage to new style Requests (#33171)

In #29623 we added `Request` object flavored requests to the low level
REST client and in #30315 we deprecated the old `performRequest`s. In a
long series of PRs I've changed all of the old style requests that I
could find with `grep`. In this PR I change all requests that I could
find by *removing* the deprecated methods. Since this is a non-trivial
change I do not include actually removing the deprecated requests. I'll
do that in a follow up. But this should be the last set of usage
removals before the actual deprecated method removal. Yay!
