HLRC: PutUserRequest should not be closeable (#34196)

The PutUserRequest implemented closeable as it assumed ownership of the
password provided to the class. This change removes the ownership of
the password, documents it in the javadoc, and removes the closeable
implementation.

Additionally, the intermediate bytes used for writing the password to
XContent are now cleared. This makes the PutUserRequest consistent with
the behavior discussed in #33509.
