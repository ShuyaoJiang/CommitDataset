Fix NPE in Logfile Audit Filter (#38120)

The culprit in #38097 is an `IndicesRequest` that has no indices,
but instead of `request.indices()` returning `null` or `String[0]`
it returned `String[] {null}` . This tripped the audit filter.

I have addressed this in two ways:
1. `request.indices()` returning `String[] {null}` is treated as `null`
    or `String[0]`, i.e. no indices
2. `null` values among the roles and indices lists, which are
    unexpected, will never again stumble the audit filter; `null` values
    are treated as special values that will not match any policy,
    i.e. their events will always be printed.
