SQL: Build CLI against compact profile again (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3392)

Months ago SQL used `Desktop#open` to view the results of graphviz
description of plans. We've since removed this feature in favor of just
writing the file. So now we can build the CLI against the same java
profile that we build everything agianst.
