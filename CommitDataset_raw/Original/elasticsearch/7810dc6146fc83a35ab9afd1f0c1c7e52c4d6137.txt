[Rollup] Add `value_count` metric (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4315)

Adds `value_count` as one of the accepted metrics.  The caveat is that
it only accepts numeric values for two reasons:

- Job validation at creation makes sure all metrics are numeric fields.
Changing this would require new syntax (or disallowing anything but
value_count on mixed fields)
- when `toBuilders()` is called, we have to supply a ValueSource to
the ValueCountBuilder, and we don't know what the field type is at that
time.

These are both fixable, but relatively more involved.  I think numeric-only
is a reasonable limitation to start with
