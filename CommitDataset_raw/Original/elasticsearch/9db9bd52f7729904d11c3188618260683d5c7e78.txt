Clean up commits when global checkpoint advanced (#28140)

Today we keep multiple index commits based on the current global 
checkpoint, but only clean up unneeded index commits when we have a new 
index commit. However, we can release the old index commits earlier once
the global checkpoint has advanced enough. This commit makes an engine
revisit the index deletion policy whenever a new global checkpoint value
is persisted and advanced enough.
