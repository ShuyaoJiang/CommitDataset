Test: bound number of requests in IndexLifecycleManagerIntegTests

The IndexLifecycleManagerIntegTests has a method that tests concurrency and executes a large number
of requests in parallel. On some machines, this can actually overwhelm a thread pool and cause the
test to fail for the wrong reasons. This commit bounds the total number of requests to 100.
