[Zen2] Introduce vote withdrawal (#35446)

If shutting down half or more of the master-eligible nodes, their votes must
first be explicitly withdrawn to ensure that the cluster doesn't lose its
quorum. This works via _voting tombstones_, stored in the cluster state, which
tell the reconfigurator to remove nodes from the voting configuration.

This change introduces voting tombstones to the cluster state, together with
transport APIs for adding and removing them, and makes use of these APIs in
`InternalTestCluster` to support tests which remove at least half of the
master-eligible nodes at once (e.g. shrinking from two master-eligible nodes to
one).
