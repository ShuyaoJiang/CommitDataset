Tweak AggregatorBase.addRequestCircuitBreakerBytes

This modifies a method Mark added to the AggregatorBase that allows aggregations
to add additional memory tracking for datastructures used during execution. If
an aggregation would like to reclaim circuit breaker reserved bytes by adding a
negative number, `addWithoutBreaking` should be used instead of
`addEstimateBytesAndMaybeBreak`.

Resolves #24511
