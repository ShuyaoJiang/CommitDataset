HLRC: Clear ML data after client tests (#33023)

This commit duplicates the `MlRestTestStateCleaner` to make sure
all ML data is removed after each test. After implementing
the job and datafeed APIs in the HLRC, we shall replace this
implementation with one using the HLRC itself.

Closes #32993
