SQL: Ignore H2 comparative tests for uppercasing/lowercasing string functions (#32604)

Skip the comparative tests using lowercasing/uppercasing against H2 (which considers the Locale).
ES-SQL is, so far, ignoring the Locale.
Still, the same queries are executed against ES-SQL alone and results asserted to be correct.
