Minor tweaks to reroute documentation (#30246)

Add yet another warning about data loss to the introductory paragraph about the
unsafe commands. Also move this paragraph next to the details of the unsafe
commands, below the section on the `retry_failed` flag.

Be more specific about how to use the URI parameters and in-body flags.

Clarify statements about when rebalancing takes place (i.e. it respects
settings)

Resolves #16113.
