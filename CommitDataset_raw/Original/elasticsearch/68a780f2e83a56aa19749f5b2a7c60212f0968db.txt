Move PeerFinder's logger to the expected package (#39412)

Today the abstract `org.elasticsearch.discovery.PeerFinder` uses the logger of
its implementation, which in production is in `o.e.cluster.coordination`. This
turns out to be confusing and unhelpful, so with this change we move to using
the logger that belongs to `PeerFinder`.
