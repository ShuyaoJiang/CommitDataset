Set acking timeout to 0 on dynamic mapping update (#31140)

As acking can fail for any reason (unrelated node being too slow, node disconnecting), it should not
be required for acking to succeed in order for index requests with dynamic mapping updates to
successfully complete.

Relates to #30672 and Closes #30844
