TEST: Capture replication targets when replication group ready (#34407)

Today, WriteReplicationAction uses a set of replication targets directly
from the primary shard of ReplicationGroup. It should be fine except
when we add/remove or promote a shard while a write action is executing.
We have encountered these two issues:

1. Replicas are not found in the replication targets. This happens
because we remove replicas but the WriteReplicationAction still uses the
old replication targets which include the removed replicas.

2. Access ReplicationGroup from a primary shard which hasn't activated
the primary-mode yet. This is because we won't activate the primary-mode
for a promoting shard after bumping the primary term which is executed
asynchronously.

This commit captures the replication targets when the replication group
is ready and continue using those targets until we re-compute the new
targets after the group is changed.
