Arithmetic

* big refactor of Processor by introducing ProcessorDefinition an
immutable tree structure used for resolving multiple inputs across
folding (in particular for aggregations) which at runtime gets
translated into 'compiled' or small Processors

Add expression arithmetic, expression folding and type coercion

Folding
* for literals, scalars and inside the optimizer

Type validation happens per type hierarchy (numeric vs decimal) not type
Ceil/Floor/Round functions return long/int instead of double
ScalarFunction preserves ProcessorDefinition instead of functionId
