SQL: Improve CircuitBreaker logic for SqlParser (#35300)

Grammar's identifiers can be completely skipped from counting depths
as they just add another level to the tree and they are always children
of some other expression which gets counted.

Increased maximum depth from 100 to 200. After testing on production
configuration with -Xss1m, depths of at least 250 can be used, so being
conservative we put the limit lower.

Fixes: #35299
