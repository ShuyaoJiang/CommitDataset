Emphasize that filesystem-level backups don't work (#33102)

It is not obvious that a filesystem-level backup may capture an inconsistent
set of files that may fail on restore, or (worse) succeed having silently
discarded some data. This change spells the out, and reorganises the first page
or so of the snapshot/restore docs to make this warning fit more nicely.
