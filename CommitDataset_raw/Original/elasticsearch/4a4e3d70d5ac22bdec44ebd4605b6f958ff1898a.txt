Default to one shard (#30539)

This commit changes the default out-of-the-box configuration for the
number of shards from five to one. We think this will help address a
common problem of oversharding. For users with time-based indices that
need a different default, this can be managed with index templates. For
users with non-time-based indices that find they need to re-shard with
the split API in place they no longer need to resort only to
reindexing.

Since this has the impact of changing the default number of shards used
in REST tests, we want to ensure that we still have coverage for issues
that could arise from multiple shards. As such, we randomize (rarely)
the default number of shards in REST tests to two. This is managed via a
global index template. However, some tests check the templates that are
in the cluster state during the test. Since this template is randomly
there, we need a way for tests to skip adding the template used to set
the number of shards to two. For this we add the default_shards feature
skip. To avoid having to write our docs in a complicated way because
sometimes they might be behind one shard, and sometimes they might be
behind two shards we apply the default_shards feature skip to all docs
tests. That is, these tests will always run with the default number of
shards (one).
