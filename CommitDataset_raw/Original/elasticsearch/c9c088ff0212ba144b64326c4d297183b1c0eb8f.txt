Use ivy pattern for elasticsearch artifacts download (#37557)

The rpm, deb and tar distributions were removed some time ago from maven
central. The zip distribution still exists there, but it does not need
to. Instead, this commit sets up an ivy repository with pattern pointing
to the elasticsearch artifacts download service. Note that the
integ-test-zip remains in maven central, since it is not present in the
download service.
