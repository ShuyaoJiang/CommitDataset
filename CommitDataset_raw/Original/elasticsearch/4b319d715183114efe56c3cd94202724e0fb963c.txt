SAML: Process only signed data (#30420)

As conformance to best practices, this changes ensures that if a
SAML Response is signed, we verify the signature before processing
it any further. We were only checking the InResponseTo and
Destination attributes before potential signature validation but
there was no reason to do that up front either.
