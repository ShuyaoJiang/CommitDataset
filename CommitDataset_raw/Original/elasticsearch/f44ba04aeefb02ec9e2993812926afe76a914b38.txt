[Zen2] Add UnicastConfiguredHostsResolver (#32642)

The `PeerFinder`, introduced in #32246, obtains the collection of seed
addresses configured by the user from a `ConfiguredHostsResolver`. In reality
this collection comes from the `UnicastHostsProvider` via a slightly
complicated threading model that performs the resolution of hostnames to
addresses using a dedicated `ExecutorService`. This commit introduces an
adapter to allow the `PeerFinder` to obtain its seed addresses in this manner.
