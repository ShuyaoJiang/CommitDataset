Move the IndexDeletionPolicy to be engine internal (#24930)

The `IndexDeletionPolicy` is currently instantiated by `IndexShard` and is then passed through to the engine as a parameter. That's a shame as it is really just an implementation detail and the engine already has a method to acquire a commit.

This is preparing for a follow up PR that will we connect the index deletion policy with a new translog deletion policy.
