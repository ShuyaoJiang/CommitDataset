Pass through script params in scripted metric agg (#29154)

* Pass script level params into scripted metric aggs (#28819)

Now params that are passed at the script level and at the aggregation level
are merged and can both be used in the aggregation scripts. If there are
any conflicts, aggregation level params will win. This may be followed
by another change detecting that case and throwing an exception to
disallow such conflicts.

* Disallow duplicate parameter names between scripted agg and script (#28819)

If a scripted metric aggregation has aggregation params and script params
which have the same name, throw an IllegalArgumentException when merging
the parameter lists.
