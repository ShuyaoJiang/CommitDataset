Completely remove Painless Type from AnalyzerCaster in favor of Java Class. (#28329)

Second part in a series of PR's to remove Painless Type in favor of Java Class. This completely removes the Painless Type dependency from AnalyzerCaster. Both casting and promotion are now based on Java Class exclusively. This also allows AnalyzerCaster to be decoupled from Definition and make cast checks be static calls again.
