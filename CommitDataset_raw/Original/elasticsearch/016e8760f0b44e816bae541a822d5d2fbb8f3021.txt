Turn off real-mem breaker in single node tests

With this commit we disable the real-memory circuit breaker in tests
that inherit from `ESSingleNodeTestCase`. As this breaker is based on
real memory usage over which we have no (full) control in tests and
their purpose is also not to test the circuit breaker, we use the
deterministic circuit breaker implementation that only accounts for
explicitly reserved memory.
