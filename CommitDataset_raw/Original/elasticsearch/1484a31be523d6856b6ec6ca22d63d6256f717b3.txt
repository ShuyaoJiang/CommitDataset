[ML][TEST] Make AutodetectMemoryLimitIT less fragile (#30716)

These tests aim to check the set model memory limit is
respected. Additionally, it was asserting counts of
partition, by, over fields in an attempt to check that
the used memory is spent meaningfully. However, this
made the tests fragile, as changes in the ml-cpp could
lead to CI failures.

This commit removes those assertions. We are working on
adding tests in ml-cpp that will compensate.
