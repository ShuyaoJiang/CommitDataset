Ensure ILM policies run safely on leader indices  (#38140)

Adds a Step to the Shrink and Delete actions which prevents those
actions from running on a leader index - all follower indices must first
unfollow the leader index before these actions can run. This prevents
the loss of history before follower indices are ready, which might
otherwise result in the loss of data.
