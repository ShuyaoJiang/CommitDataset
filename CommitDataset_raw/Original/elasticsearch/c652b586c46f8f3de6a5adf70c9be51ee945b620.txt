Remove `discovery.type` BWC layer from the EC2/Azure/GCE plugins #25080

Those plugins don't replace the discovery logic but rather only provide a custom unicast host provider for their respective platforms. in 5.1 we introduced the  `discovery.zen.hosts_provider` setting to better reflect it. This PR removes BWC code in those plugins as it is not needed anymore

Fixes #24543
