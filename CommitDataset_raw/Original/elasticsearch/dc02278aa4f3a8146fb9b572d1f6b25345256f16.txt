Disable specific locales for tests in fips mode (#38938)

* Disable specific locales for tests in fips mode

The Bouncy Castle FIPS provider that we use for running our tests
in fips mode has an issue with locale sensitive handling of Dates as
described in https://github.com/bcgit/bc-java/issues/405

This causes certificate validation to fail if any given test that
includes some form of certificate validation happens to run in one
of the locales. This manifested earlier in #33081 which was
handled insufficiently in #33299

This change ensures that the problematic 3 locales

* th-TH
* ja-JP-u-ca-japanese-x-lvariant-JP
* th-TH-u-nu-thai-x-lvariant-TH

will not be used when running our tests in a FIPS 140 JVM. It also
reverts #33299
