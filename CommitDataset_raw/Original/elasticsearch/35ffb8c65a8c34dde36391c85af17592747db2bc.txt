Add public key header/footer (#30877)

A previous commit added the public key used for signing artifacts to the
plugin CLI. This commit is an iteration on that to add the header and
footer to the key so that it is clear what the key is. Instead, we strip
the header/footer on read. With this change we simplify our test where
keys already in this format are generated and we had to strip on the
test side.
