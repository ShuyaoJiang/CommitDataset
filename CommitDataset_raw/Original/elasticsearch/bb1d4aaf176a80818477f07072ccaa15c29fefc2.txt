Watcher: Fix put watch action (#31524)

If no version is specified when putting a watch, the index API should be
used instead of the update API, so that the whole watch gets overwritten
instead of being merged with the existing one.

Merging only happens when a version is specified, so that credentials can be omitted, which is important for the watcher UI.
