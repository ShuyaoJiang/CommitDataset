Disable `HipChatServiceTests` integration tests

This is related to elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2429. These tests are currently disabled due to
calls to the hipchat integration api failing. There is an open infra
issue for this (elastic/infra#2726).

Original commit: elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch@4aa9fe03873c5bfb71674cd82204fdf0c0f2bd29
