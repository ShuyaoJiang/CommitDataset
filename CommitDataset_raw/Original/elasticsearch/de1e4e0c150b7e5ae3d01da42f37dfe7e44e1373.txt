Accept an array of field names and boosts in the index.query.default_field setting (#26320)

* Accept an array of field names and boosts in the index.query.default_field setting

This commit allows to define an array of field names and boosts for the index setting `index.query.default_field`.
The format is equivalent to the `fields` options of the full text search queries (e.g. field_name^boost).
This commit also makes this setting dynamically updatable.

Fixes #25946
