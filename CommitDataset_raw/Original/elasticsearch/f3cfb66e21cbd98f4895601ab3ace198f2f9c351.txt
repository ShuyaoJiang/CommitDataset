Clean up ShardSearchLocalRequest (#38574)

Added a constructor accepting `StreamInput` as argument, which allowed to
make most of the instance members final as well as remove the default
constructor.
Removed a test only constructor in favour of invoking the existing
constructor that takes a `SearchRequest` as first argument.
Also removed profile members and related methods as they were all unused.
