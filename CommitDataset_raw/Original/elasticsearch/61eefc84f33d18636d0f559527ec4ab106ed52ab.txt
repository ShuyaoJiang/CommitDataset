Add Create Snapshot to High-Level Rest Client (#31215)

Added support to the high-level rest client for the create snapshot API call. This required 
several changes to toXContent which may need to be cleaned up in a later PR. Also 
added several parsers for fromXContent to be able to retrieve appropriate responses 
along with tests.
