[RCI] Add IndexShardOperationPermits.asyncBlockOperations(ActionListener<Releasable>) (#34902)

The current implementation of asyncBlockOperations() can be used to
execute some code once all indexing operations permits have been acquired,
 then releases all permits immediately after the code execution. This
 immediate release is not suitable for treatments that need to keep all
 permits over multiple execution steps.

This commit adds a new asyncBlockOperations() that exposes a Releasable,
 making it possible to acquire all permits and only release them all
 when needed by closing the Releasable. The existing blockOperations() 
method has been modified to delegate permit acquisition/releasing to this new
method.
