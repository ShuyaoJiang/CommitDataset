Docs: Drop inline callouts from painless book (#40805)

Drops the inline callouts from the painless reference book. These
callouts are incompatible with Asciidoctor and we'd very much like to
switch to Asciidoctor for building this book, partially because
Asciidoctor is actively developed and AsciiDoc is not, and partially
because it builds the book three times faster.
