Deprecate fallback to java on PATH (#37990)

Finding java on the path is sometimes confusing for users and
unexpected, as well as leading to a different java being used than a
user expects.  This commit adds warning messages when starting
elasticsearch (or any tools like the plugin cli) and using java found
on the PATH instead of via JAVA_HOME.
