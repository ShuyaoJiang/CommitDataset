Avoid blocking non-reproducible randomness in test (#36561)

The security documentation test uses
SecureRandom#getStrongInstance. This defaults to
securerandom.strongAlgorithms=NativePRNGBlocking:SUN,DRBG:SUN which
means a blocking implementation that reads from /dev/random. This means
that this test can stall if the entropy on the machine is
exhausted. Anyway, it also means that the randomness is
non-reproducible, a thing that we try to avoid in tests. This commit
switches to a boring randomness source to avoid the blocking, and to
keep the test reproducible.
