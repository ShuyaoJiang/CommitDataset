Rename internal repository actions to be internal (#36244)

This is a follow-up to #36086. It renames the internal repository
actions to be prefixed by "internal". This allows the system user to
execute the actions.

Additionally, this PR stops casting Client to NodeClient. The client we
have is a NodeClient so executing the actions will be local.
