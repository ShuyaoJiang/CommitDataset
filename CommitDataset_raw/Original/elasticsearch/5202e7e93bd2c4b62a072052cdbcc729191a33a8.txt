Settings: Move keystore creation to plugin installation (#26329)

This commit removes the keystore creation on elasticsearch startup, and
instead adds a plugin property which indicates the plugin needs the
keystore to exist. It does still make sure the keystore.seed exists on
ES startup, but through an "upgrade" method that loading the keystore in
Bootstrap calls.

closes #26309
