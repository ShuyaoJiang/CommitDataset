Use readFully() to read bytes from CipherInputStream (#28515)

Changes how data is read from CipherInputStream

 Instead of using `read()` and checking that the bytes read are what we 
expect, use `readFully()` which will read exactly the number of bytes
while keep reading until the end of the stream or throw an
`EOFException` if not all bytes can be read.

This approach keeps the simplicity of using CipherInputStream while
working as expected with both JCE and BCFIPS Security Providers
