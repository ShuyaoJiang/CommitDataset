Correct bug in ScriptDocValues (#40488)

If a field `field_name` was missing in a document,
doc['field_name'].get(0) incorrectly retrieved
a value of the previously accessed document.
This happened because `get(int index)` function
was just accessing `values[index]` without
checking the number of values - `count`.

This PR fixes this.
