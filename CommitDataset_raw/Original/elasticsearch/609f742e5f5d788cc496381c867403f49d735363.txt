Fix kerberos setting registration (#35986)

In #30241 Realm settings were changed, but the Kerberos realm settings
were not registered correctly. This change fixes the registration of
those Kerberos settings.

Also adds a new integration test that ensures every internal realm can
be configured in a test cluster.

Also fixes the QA test for kerberos.

Resolves: #35942
