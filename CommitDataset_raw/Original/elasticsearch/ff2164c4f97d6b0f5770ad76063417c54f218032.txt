Revisit deletion policy after release the last snapshot (#28627)

We currently revisit the index deletion policy whenever the global
checkpoint has advanced enough. We should also revisit the deletion
policy after releasing the last snapshot of a snapshotting commit. With 
this change, the old index commits will be cleaned up as soon as
possible.
