[SECURITY] Set Auth-scheme preference (#33156)

Some browsers (eg. Firefox) behave differently when presented with
multiple auth schemes in 'WWW-Authenticate' header. The expected
behavior is that browser select the most secure auth-scheme before
trying others, but Firefox selects the first presented auth scheme and
tries the next ones sequentially. As the browser interpretation is
something that we do not control, we can at least present the auth
schemes in most to least secure order as the server's preference.

This commit modifies the code to collect and sort the auth schemes
presented by most to least secure. The priority of the auth schemes is
fixed, the lower number denoting more secure auth-scheme.
The current order of schemes based on the ES supported auth-scheme is
[Negotiate, Bearer,Basic] and when we add future support for
other schemes we will need to update the code. If need be we will make
this configuration customizable in future.

Unit test to verify the WWW-Authenticate header values are sorted by
server preference as more secure to least secure auth schemes.
Tested with Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer 11.
