Fix retention leases sync on recovery test

This test had a bug. We attempt to allow only the primary to be
allocated, to force all replicas to recovery from the primary after we
had set the state of the retention leases on the primary. However, in
building the index settings, we were overwriting the settings that
exclude the replicas from being allocated. This means that some of the
replicas would end up assigned and rather than receive retention leases
during recovery, they would be part of the replication group receiving
retention leases as they are manipulated. Since retention lease renewals
are only synced periodically, this means that the replica could be
lagging a little behind in some cases leading to an assertion tripping
in the test. This commit addresses this by ensuring that the replicas
are indeed not allocated until after the retention leases are done being
manipulated on the replica. We did this by not overwriting the exclude
settings.

Closes #39105
