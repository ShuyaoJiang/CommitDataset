Remove BWC layer for rejected execution exception

The serialization changes for rejected execution exceptions has been
backported to 6.x with the intention to appear in all versions since
6.3.0. Therefore, this BWC layer is no longer needed in master since
master would never speak to a node that does not speak the same
serialization.
