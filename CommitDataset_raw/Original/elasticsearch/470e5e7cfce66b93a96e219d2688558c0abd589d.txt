Add additional low-level logging handler ()

* Add additional low-level logging handler

We have the trace handler which is useful for recording sent messages
but there are times where it would be useful to have more low-level
logging about the events occurring on a channel. This commit adds a
logging handler that can be enabled by setting a certain log level
(org.elasticsearch.transport.netty4.ESLoggingHandler) to trace that
provides trace logging on low-level channel events and includes some
information about the request/response read/write events on the channel
as well.
