[Tests] Fix creating ExplainLifecycleRequest with no indices (#35828)

We didn't check that the ExplainLifecycleRequest was constructed with at least
one index before, now that we do we must also make sure the tests
mutateInstance() method used in equals/hashCode checks doesn't accidentally
create an empty index array.

Closes #35822
