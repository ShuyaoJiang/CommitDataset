Allow double aborts on bulk item requests

In some cases a request can already be aborted and retried. This means
the condition that aborting a request should only happen when an item
has not been processed yet is too strict. This commit allows for a
double abort. If we attempt to abort an operation that was previously
processed but not aborted, we treat that as a hard failure.
