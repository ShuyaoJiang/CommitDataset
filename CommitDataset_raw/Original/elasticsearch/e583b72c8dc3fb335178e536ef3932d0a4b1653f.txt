Build: Move and simplify ml cpp snapshot (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3762)

Now that ML binaries are public, there is no longer a need to use the s3
client to access the bucket, since creds are not needed. This commit
also moves the cpp snapshot project under the ml module, since it is
specific to that and does not need to clutter the plugin dir.
