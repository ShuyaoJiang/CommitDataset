Set the elasticsearch-nio codebase for tests (#28067)

This commit sets the elasticsearch-nio code base in the
BootstrapForTesting class. This is necessary as that codebase needs
socket permissions. Setting the codebase manually is necessary as
intellij does not package our internal libraries when running tests.
