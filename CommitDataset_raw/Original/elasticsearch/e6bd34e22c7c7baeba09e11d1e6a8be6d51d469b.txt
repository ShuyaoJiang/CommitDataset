Tighten which classes can exit

Today a SecureSM security manager allows defining a list of packages
that can exit the VM. However, today there are no restrictions on
defining a package inside another JAR. This commit strengthens the
ability to prevent exit by allowing construction of SecureSM to be done
with a list of regular expressions (instead of a list of prefix names)
that classes will be tested against. With this, a security manager can
be installed that permits only exiting from an exact list of classes.
