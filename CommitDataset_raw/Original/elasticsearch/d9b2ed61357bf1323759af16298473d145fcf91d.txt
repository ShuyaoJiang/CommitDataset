Send clear session as routable remote request (#36805)

This commit adds a RemoteClusterAwareRequest interface that allows a
request to specify which remote node it should be routed to. The remote
cluster aware client will attempt to route the request directly to this
node. Otherwise it will send it as a proxy action to eventually end up
on the requested node.

It implements the ccr clean_session action with this client.
