Fix CoordinatorTests.testIncompatibleDiffResendsFullState (#39345)

This test started failing since decreasing the leader and follower check timeouts (#38298). The
reason is that the test was relying on the default publication timeout to come into effect before
leader / follower check timeouts, which is now not always true anymore.

Closes #38867
