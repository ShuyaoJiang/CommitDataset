* add copyright/scope configuration for intellij

This commit introduces a section discussing the ability to define
copyright rules in intellij for inserting the appropriate copyright
headers into files across both apache2-Elasticsearch, as well as the
commercial code under `x-pack`.

Some other re-organization was made to create more sub-structure

* update to reflect reviewer comments
