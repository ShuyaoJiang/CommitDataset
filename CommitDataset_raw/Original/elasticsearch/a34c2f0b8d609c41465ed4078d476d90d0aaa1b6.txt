Ensure external refreshes will also refresh internal searcher to minimize segment creation (#27253)

We cut over to internal and external IndexReader/IndexSearcher in #26972 which uses
two independent searcher managers. This has the downside that refreshes of the external
reader will never clear the internal version map which in-turn will trigger additional
and potentially unnecessary segment flushes since memory must be freed. Under heavy
indexing load with low refresh intervals this can cause excessive segment creation which
causes high GC activity and significantly increases the required segment merges.

This change adds a dedicated external reference manager that delegates refreshes to the
internal reference manager that then `steals` the refreshed reader from the internal
reference manager for external usage. This ensures that external and internal readers
are consistent on an external refresh. As a sideeffect this also releases old segments
referenced by the internal reference manager which can potentially hold on to already merged
away segments until it is refreshed due to a flush or indexing activity.
