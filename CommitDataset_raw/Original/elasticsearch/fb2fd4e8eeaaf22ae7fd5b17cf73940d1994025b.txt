Fix preserving FiltersAggregationBuilder#keyed field on rewrite (#27900)

Currently FiltersAggregationBuilder#doRewrite creates a new FiltersAggregationBuilder which doesn't correctly copy the original "keyed" field if a non-keyed filter gets rewritten.
This can cause rendering bugs of the output aggregations like the one reported in #27841.

Closes #27841
