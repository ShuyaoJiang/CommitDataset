Revert shading for the low level rest client (#26367)

At current, we do not feel there is enough of a reason to shade the low
level rest client. It caused problems with commons logging and IDE's
during the brief time it was used. We did not know exactly how many
users will need this, and decided that leaving shading out until we
gather more information is best. Users can still shade the jar
themselves. For information and feeback, see issue #26366.

Closes #26328
