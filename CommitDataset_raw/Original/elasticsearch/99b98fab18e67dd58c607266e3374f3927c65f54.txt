Core: Pick inner most parse exception as root cause (#30270)

Just like `ElasticsearchException`, the inner most
`XContentParseException` tends to contain the root cause of the
exception and show be show to the user in the `root_cause` field.

The effectively undoes most of the changes that #29373 made to the
`root_cause` for parsing exceptions. The `type` field still changes from
`parse_exception` to `x_content_parse_exception`, but this seems like a
fairly safe change.

`ElasticsearchWrapperException` *looks* tempting to implement this but
the behavior isn't quite right. `ElasticsearchWrapperExceptions` are
entirely unwrapped until the cause no longer
`implements ElasticsearchWrapperException` but `XContentParseException`
should be unwrapped until its cause is no longer an
`XContentParseException` but no further. In other words,
`ElasticsearchWrapperException` are unwrapped one step too far.

Closes #30261
