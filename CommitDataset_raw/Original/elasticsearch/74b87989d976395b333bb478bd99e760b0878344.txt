Build: Merge xpack checkstyle config into core (#33399)

Solves all of the xpack line length suppressions and then merges the
remainder of the xpack checkstyle_suppressions.xml file into the core
checkstyle_suppressions.xml file. At this point that just means the
antlr generated files for sql.

It also adds an exclusion to the line length tests for javadocs that
are just a URL. We have one such javadoc and breaking up the line would
make the link difficult to use.
