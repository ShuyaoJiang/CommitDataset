Test: remove KnownActionsTests (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3133)

This commit removes the KnownActionsTests as it no longer serves the intended purpose of catching
actions/handlers added to elasticsearch that security needs to be aware of. Today, it is common
for this test to break the build and as a mechanical response developers just add to the actions
or handlers file to get the build green again.
