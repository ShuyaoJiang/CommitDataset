Protect ScriptedMetricIT test cases against failures on 0-doc shards (#32959) (#32968)

Randomized test conditions that cause some shards to have no docs on them
failed due to test asserts that relied on a lazy initialization side effect
from the map script. After this fix:

- Test cases with the relevant init script are protected
- Test cases with the relevant combine or reduce scripts were already
  protected, because the combine and reduce scripts safely handle this case.
