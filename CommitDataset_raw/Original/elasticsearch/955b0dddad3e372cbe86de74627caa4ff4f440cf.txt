Watcher: Ignore deactivated state with execute watch API (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4054)

If a watch is not active, it should still be executed, if it is called
via the execute watch API.

This commit adds an additional method to the execution context to check
for this, which returns true for a manual execution context but checks
the watch status for the triggered one.
