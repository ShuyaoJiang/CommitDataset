Allow unstashing values into keys (#24685)

This is almost exclusively for docs test which frequently match the
entire response. This allow something like:
```
  - set: {nodes.$master.http.publish_address: host}
  - match:
      $body:
        {
          "nodes": {
            $host: {
              ... stuff in here ...
            }
          }
        }
```

This should make it possible for the docs tests to work with
unpredictable keys.
