Deprecate minimum_master_nodes (#37868)

Today we pass `discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes` to nodes started up in
tests, but for 7.x nodes this setting is not required as it has no effect.
This commit removes this setting so that nodes are started with more realistic
configurations, and deprecates it.
