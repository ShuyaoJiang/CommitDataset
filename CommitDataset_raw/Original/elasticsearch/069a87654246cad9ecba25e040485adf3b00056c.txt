Added minimal docs for reindex api in java-api docs

Additionally:
* Included the existing update by query java api docs in java-api docs.
  (for some reason it was never included, it needed some tweaking and
  then it was good to go)
* moved delete-by-query / update-by-query code samples to java file so
  that we can verify that these samples at least compile.

Closes #24203
