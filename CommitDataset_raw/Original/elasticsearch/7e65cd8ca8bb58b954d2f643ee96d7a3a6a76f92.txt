Build: Add warning when bwc tests are disabled (#28585)

The bwc tests can be disabled in order to facilitate commits necessary
to older branches to maintain backcompat. A check already exists to
ensure this flag is not left disabled too long (once a day by the
branchConsistency check). However, it can be surprising if you try
running bwc tests explicitly and they look like nothing is happening.
This commit adds a warning during configuration to ensure it is clear
the bwc tests are disabled and enforces a link to a PR which is in the
process of being backported.
