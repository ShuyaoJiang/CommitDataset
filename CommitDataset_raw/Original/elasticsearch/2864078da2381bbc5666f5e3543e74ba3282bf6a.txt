[ML] Move job group validation after parsing (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2207)

Validating job groups during parsing results into
the validation error being wrapped into a parse
exception. The UI then does not display the cause of the
error. Finally, it is conceptually not a parse error, so
it belongs outside the parsing phase.
