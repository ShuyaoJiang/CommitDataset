Add local session timeouts to leader node (#37438)

This is related to #35975. This commit adds timeout functionality to
the local session on a leader node. When a session is started, a timeout
is scheduled using a repeatable runnable. If the session is not accessed
in between two runs the session is closed. When the sssion is closed,
the repeating task is cancelled.

Additionally, this commit moves session uuid generation to the leader
cluster. And renames the PutCcrRestoreSessionRequest to
StartCcrRestoreSessionRequest to reflect that change.
