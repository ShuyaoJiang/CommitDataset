TEST: Unmute testPrimaryRelocationWhileIndexing

Previously we did not put an indexing to a version map if that map does
not require safe access but removed the existing delete tombstone only
if assertion enabled. In #29585, we removed the side-effect caused by
assertion then this test started failing. This failure can be explained
as follows:

- Step 1: Index a doc then delete that doc

- Step 2: The version map can switch to unsafe mode because of
  concurrent refreshes (implicitly called by flushes)

- Step 3: Index a document - the version map won't add this version
  value and won't prune the tombstone (previously it did)

- Step 4: Delete a document - this will return NOT_FOUND instead of
  DELETED because of the stale delete tombstone

This failure is actually fixed by #29619 in which we never leave stale
delete tombstones

Closes #29626
