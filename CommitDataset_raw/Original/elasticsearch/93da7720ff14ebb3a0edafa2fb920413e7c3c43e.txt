Move non-core mappers to a module. (#26549)

Today we have all non-plugin mappers in core. I'd like to start moving those
that neither map to json datatypes nor are very frequently used like `date` or
`ip` to a module.

This commit creates a new module called `mappers-extra` and moves the
`scaled_float` and `token_count` mappers to it. I'd like to eventually move
`range` fields there but it's more complicated due to their intimate
relationship with range queries.
