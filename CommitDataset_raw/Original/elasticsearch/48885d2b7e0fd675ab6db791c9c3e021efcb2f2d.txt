TESTS: Fix Buf Leaks in HttpReadWriteHandlerTests (#32377)

* TESTS: Fix Buf Leaks in HttpReadWriteHandlerTests

* Release all ref counted things that weren't getting properly released
* Mannually force channel promise to be completed because mock channel doesn't do it and it prevents one `release` call in `io.netty.channel.ChannelOutboundHandlerAdapter#write` from firing
