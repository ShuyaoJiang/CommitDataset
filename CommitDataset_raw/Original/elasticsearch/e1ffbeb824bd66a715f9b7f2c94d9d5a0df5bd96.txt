Fix bad version check writing Repository nodes (#30846)

The writeTo method of VerifyRepositoryResponse incorrectly used its
local version to determine what it was receiving, rather than the
sender's version. This fixes a bug that ocassionally happened when a 6.4
master node sent data to a 7.0 client, causing the number of bytes to be
improperly read. This also unmutes the test.

Closes #30807
