Add CoordinatorTests for empty unicast hosts list (#38209)

Today we have DiscoveryDisruptionIT tests for checking that discovery can still
work once the cluster has formed, even if the cluster is misconfigured and only
has a single master-eligible node in its unicast hosts list. In fact with Zen2
we can go one better: we do not need any nodes in the unicast hosts list,
because nodes also use the contents of the last-committed cluster state for
discovery. Additionally, the DiscoveryDisruptionIT tests were failing due to
the overenthusiastic fault-detection timeouts.

This commit replaces these tests with deterministic `CoordinatorTests` that
verify the same behaviour. It also removes some duplication by extracting a
test method called `testFollowerCheckerAfterMasterReelection()`

Closes #37687
