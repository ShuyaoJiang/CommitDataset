[Test] Do not rely on MockZenPing for Azure tests (#27945)

This commit changes some Azure tests so that they do not rely on
MockZenPing and TestZenDiscovery anymore, but instead use a mocked
AzureComputeService that exposes internal test cluster nodes as if
they were real Azure nodes.

Related to #27859

Closes #27917, #11533
