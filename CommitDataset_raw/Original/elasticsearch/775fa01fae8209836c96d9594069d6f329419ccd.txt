Safe publication of AutoFollowCoordinator (#40153)

We were leaking a reference to an AutoFollowCoordinator during
construction, violating safe publication according to the JLS
specification. This commit addresses this by waiting to register
AutoFollowCoordinator with the ClusterApplierService after the
AutoFollowCoordinator is fully constructed. We also remove ourselves as
a listener when stopping.
