Ensure transport impls read SSLConfiguration early (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1797)

Today we parse / construct SSLConfiguration late when client / server
channels are created. This is problematic if we try to read from secure settings
in the future since we need to read all secure settings as soon as the node is
constructed. If we keep on reading late, we will access a closed keystore
since channel creation happens during node startup.
