Allow AD realm to perform 'run-as' lookups (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2531)

- Marks the AD Session factory as supporting "lookup" (Refer: elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch@40b07b3)
- Adds "pool.enabled" as a registered setting on AD realm (Refer: elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch@40b07b3)
- Fixes LDAP user lookup that has been broken since 6.x (Refer: elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch@f796949)
