[ML] Avoid spurious logging when deleting lookback job from the UI (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3193)

When you click "delete" in the UI it force-deletes the datafeed then
force-deletes the job.  For a datafeed doing lookback, this results
in a close followed very quickly by a kill on the autodetect process.
Depending on thread scheduling this could cause a lot of spurious
errors and exception traces to be logged.

This change prevents the log spam in this scenario.
