Remove special handling for ingest plugins (#36967)

We added some special handling for installing and removing the
ingest-geoip and ingest-user-agent plugins when we converted them to
modules. This special handling was done to minimize breaking users in a
minor release. However, do not want to maintain this behavior forever so
this commit removes that special handling in the master branch so that
starting with 7.0.0 this special handling will be gone.
