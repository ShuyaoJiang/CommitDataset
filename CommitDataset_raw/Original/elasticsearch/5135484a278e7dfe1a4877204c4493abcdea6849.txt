Test: Expect extra Exception in die_with_dignity (#29138)

I did a little digging. It looks like IOException is thrown when the other
side closes its connection while we're waiting on our buffer to fill up. We
totally expect that in this test. It feels to me like we should throw a
`ConnectionClosedException` but upstream does not agree:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HTTPASYNC-134

While we *could* catch the exception and transform it ourselves that
seems like a bigger change than is merited at this point.

Closes #29136
