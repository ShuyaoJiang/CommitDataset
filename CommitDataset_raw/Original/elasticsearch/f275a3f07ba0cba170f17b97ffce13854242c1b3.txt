Support bootstrap password when in container (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1832)

This is related to elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1217. This commit reads two environment variables on
startup: BOOTSTRAP_PWD and ELASTIC_CONTAINER. If BOOTSTRAP_PWD is
present, ELASTIC_CONTAINER must be set to true. Otherwise a new
bootstrap check will fail.

If ELASTIC_CONTAINER is set to true, the elastic user can be
authenticated with the BOOTSTRAP_PWD variable when its password
has not been explicitly set.
