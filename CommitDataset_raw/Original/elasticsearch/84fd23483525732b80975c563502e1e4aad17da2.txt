Add the Shrink Action to Index Lifecycle Management (#3491)

This does the following in sequential service polls

1. sets the index to read-only and runs shrink with a modified `index.lifecycle.name` setting set to `null`.
2. checks to see if shrink is complete, if it is...
    b. set target index's `index.lifecycle.*` settings to the original index's values.
3. if not complete, just wait till next iteration
4. if operating on shrunken index, delete old index and add it as an alias to shrunken index
