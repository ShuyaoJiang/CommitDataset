Add primary term to translog header (#29227)

This change adds the current primary term to the header of the current
translog file. Having a term in a translog header is a prerequisite step
that allows us to trim translog operations given the max valid seq# for
that term.

This commit also updates tests to conform the primary term invariant 
which guarantees that all translog operations in a translog file have
its terms at most the term stored in the translog header.
