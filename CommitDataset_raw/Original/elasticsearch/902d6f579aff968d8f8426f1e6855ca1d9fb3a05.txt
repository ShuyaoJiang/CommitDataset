Exposed engine must have all ops below gcp during rollback (#36159)

Today we expose a new engine immediately during Lucene rollback. The new
engine is started with a safe commit which might not include all
acknowledged operation. With this change, we won't expose the new engine
until it has recovered from the local translog.

Note that this solution is not complete since it's able to reserve only
acknowledged operations before the global checkpoint. This is because we
replay translog up to the global checkpoint during rollback. A per-doc
Lucene rollback would solve this issue entirely.
