Add validation of keystore setting names (#27626)

This commit restricts settings added to the keystore to have a lowercase
ascii name. The java Keystore javadocs state that case sensitivity of
key alias names are implementation dependent. This ensures regardless of
case sensitivity in a jvm implementation, the keys will be stored as we
expect.
