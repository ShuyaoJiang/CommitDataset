Use a `_recovery_source` if source is omitted or modified (#31106)

Today if a user omits the `_source` entirely or modifies the source
on indexing we have no chance to re-create the document after it has
been added. This is an issue for CCR and recovery based on soft deletes
which we are going to make the default. This change adds an additional
recovery source if the source is disabled or modified that is only kept
around until the document leaves the retention policy window.

This change adds a merge policy that efficiently removes this extra source
on merge for all document that are live and not in the retention policy window
anymore.
