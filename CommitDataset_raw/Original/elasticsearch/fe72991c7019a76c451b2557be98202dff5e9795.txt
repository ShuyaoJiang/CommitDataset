[Logstash] Add new component to x-pack to handle LS features (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1530)

This commit adds a new Logstash component to x-pack to support the config management work. Currently, the functionality in this component is really simple; all it does is upload a new index template for `.logstash` index. This index stores the actual LS configuration.

On this template is bootstrapped in ES, Kibana can write user-created LS configs which adhere to the mapping defined here. In the future, we're looking into adding more functionality on the ES side to handle config documents, but for now, this is simple.
