[ML] Prevent time_field and control field name in analysis_config (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1729)

In does not make sense for the time_field in the data_description to
be used as a by/over/partition field name, nor the summary_count_field,
categorization_field or as an influencer.  Therefore, configurations
where the time_field in the data_description is used in the
analysis_config are now rejected.

Additionally, it causes a problem communicating with the C++ code if
the control field name (which is '.') is used in the analysis_config,
so this is also rejected at the validation stage.
