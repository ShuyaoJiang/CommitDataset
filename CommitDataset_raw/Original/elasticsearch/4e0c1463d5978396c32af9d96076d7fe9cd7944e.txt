Fix build.snapshot bug in version collection (#28641)

The build.snapshot was mistakenly passed in to every snapshot version,
so when release tests were run, these versions were mistaken as released
entities and could not be found in maven, because they do not
exist. This fix removes that bug in logic, and always makes them proper
snapshots. This has a benefit of cleaning up the VersionUtilsTests
because they no longer rely on different sets of versions to check
against, which was also a bug.
