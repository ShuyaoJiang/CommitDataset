[Rollup] Add scaled_float to allowed metric mapper types (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4423)

We grab all the NumberFieldMappers to determine the whitelist of allowed
number types, but `scaled_float` is in a module so it isn't picked up
automatically.  This commit adds `scaled_float` to the whitelist
manually.
