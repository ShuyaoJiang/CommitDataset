Use soft-update to maintain document history (#29458)

Today we can use the soft-update feature from Lucene to maintain a 
history of document. This change simply replaces hard-update in the
Engine by soft-update methods. Stale operations, delete, and no-ops will
be handled in subsequent changes. This change is just a cut-over from
hard-update to soft-update, no new functionality has been introduced.
