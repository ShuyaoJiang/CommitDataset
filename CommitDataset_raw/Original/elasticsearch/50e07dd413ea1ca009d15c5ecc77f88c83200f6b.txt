Add an index setting to control TieredMergePolicy#deletesPctAllowed (#32907)

This change adds an expert index setting called `index.merge.policy.deletes_pct_allowed`.
It controls the maximum percentage of deleted documents that is tolerated in the index.
Lower values make the index more space efficient at the expense of increased CPU and I/O activity.
Values must be between `20` and `50`. Default value is `33`.
