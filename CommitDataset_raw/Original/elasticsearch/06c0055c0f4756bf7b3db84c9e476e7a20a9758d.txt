Have circuit breaker succeed on unknown mem usage

With this commit we implement a workaround for
https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8207200 which is a race
condition in the JVM that results in `IllegalArgumentException` to be
thrown in rare cases when we determine memory usage via `MemoryMXBean`.
As we do not want to fail requests in those cases we always return zero
memory usage.
