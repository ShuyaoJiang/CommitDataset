Adds metadata to rewritten aggregations (#28185)

* Adds metadata to rewritten aggregations

Previous to this change, if any filters in the filters aggregation were rewritten, the rewritten version of the FiltersAggregationBuilder would not contain the metadata form the original. This is because `AbstractAggregationBuilder.getMetadata()` returns an empty map when not metadata is set.

Closes #28170

* Always set metadata when rewritten
