Increase suite timeout to 30 minutes for docs tests (#40521)

I have been hitting the suite timeout on `DocsClientYamlTestSuiteIT`
As far as I can see, the docs tests are taking quite a while, I assume
it's because more and more docs snippets get added over time, which
means more tests. The current suite timeout is the default 20 minutes.
It takes me just a little less than 20 minutes to run these on my
laptop. On my CI, I end up hitting the suite timeout. Hereby I propose
that we increase the suite timeout to 30 minutes.
