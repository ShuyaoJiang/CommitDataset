Build: Improve test status logging (#28563)

Tests use the (internal) gradle progress logger. Since aroudn gradle
4.0, loggers can have children loggers which each get their own line of
updating output. This commit improves the test status output to give
each jvm its own status line, as well as lines for suite and test
counts. It also fixes an issue where the progress logger was not marked
as completed, which caused its last output to never be cleared.
