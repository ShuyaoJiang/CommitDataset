Watcher: Further preparations for source repo split (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3006)

Changes to further prepare for feature split with regards to watcher:

- CryptoService has been moved into watcher
- CryptoService.generateKey() has been moved into SystemKeyTools, only
  used there
- The creation of the http client/notification classes have been moved
  into watcher, no further dependencies on watcher in XPackPlugin
- Each subproject now registers it's own named writeables

Relates elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2925
