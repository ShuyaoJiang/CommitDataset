Fixes array out of bounds for value count agg (#26038)

https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/17379 fixed many metric aggs so that if the parent aggregation does not collect any documents an empty bucket value is returned instead of an ArrayOutOfBoundsException being thrown. Unfortunately the value count aggregation was mised from this fix.

This change applies this fix from #17379 for the value count aggregation.
