Watcher: fix metric stats names (#34951)

* Watcher: fix metric stats names

The current watcher stats metric names doesn't match the current
documentation. This commit fixes the behavior of `queued_watches`
metric, deprecates `pending_watches` metric and adds `current_watches`
to match the documented behavior. It also fixes the documentation, which
introduced `executing_watches` metric that was never added.

Fixes #34865
