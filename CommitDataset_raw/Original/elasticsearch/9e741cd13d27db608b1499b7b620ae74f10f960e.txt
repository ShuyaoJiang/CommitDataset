Tests: Add ability to generate random new fields for xContent parsing test (#23437)

For the response parsing we want to be lenient when it comes to parsing
new xContent fields. In order to ensure this in our testing, this change
adds a utility method to XContentTestUtils that takes xContent bytes
representation as input and recursively a random field on each object
level.

Sometimes we also want to exclude a whole subtree from this treatment 
(e.g. skipping "_source"), other times an element (e.g. "fields", "highlight" 
in SearchHit) can have arbitraryly named objects. Those cases can be 
specified as exceptions.
