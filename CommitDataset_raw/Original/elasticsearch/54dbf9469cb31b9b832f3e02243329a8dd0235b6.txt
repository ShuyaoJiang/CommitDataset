Update httpclient for JDK 11 TLS engine (#37994)

The apache commons http client implementations recently released
versions that solve TLS compatibility issues with the new TLS engine
that supports TLSv1.3 with JDK 11. This change updates our code to
use these versions since JDK 11 is a supported JDK and we should
allow the use of TLSv1.3.
