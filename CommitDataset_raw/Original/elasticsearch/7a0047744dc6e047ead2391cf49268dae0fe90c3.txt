`query_string` should use indexed prefixes (#36895)

The QueryStringQueryBuilder does not currently delegate to the field mapper's prefixQuery
method, so does not use indexed prefixes. This commit corrects this.

It also fixes a bug where a query a* would not match the word a if indexed prefixes were used with
a minchar setting of 2.
