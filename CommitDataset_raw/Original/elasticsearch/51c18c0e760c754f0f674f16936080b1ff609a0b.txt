Reload SSL context on file change for LDAP (#36937)

In #30509 we changed the way SSL configuration is reloaded when the
content of a file changes. As a consequence of that implementation
change the LDAP realm ceased to pick up changes to CA files (or other
certificate material) if they changed.

This commit repairs the reloading behaviour for LDAP realms, and adds
a test for this functionality.

Resolves: #36923
