Add high level rest client support for SetIndexLifecyclePolicy (#32443)

This adds HLRC support for the ILM operation of setting an index's lifecycle
policy.

It also includes extracting and renaming a number of classes (like the request
and response objects) as well as the addition of a new `IndexLifecycleClient`
for the HLRC. This is a prerequisite to making the `index.lifecycle.name`
setting internal only, because we require a dedicated REST endpoint to change
the policy, and our tests currently set this setting with the REST client
multiple places. A subsequent PR will change the setting to be internal and move
those uses over to this new API.

This misses some links to the documentation because I don't think ILM has any
documentation available yet.

Relates to #29827 and #29823
