Upgrade beats templates that we use for bwc testing. (#27929)

These templates were generated with 5.0. We need those generated with 6.0 since
we do not guarantee compatibility with previous versions of the template anyway.

I removed the winlogbeat template which is a bit harder to generate as it requires
Windows, since we do not aim to be exhaustive.
