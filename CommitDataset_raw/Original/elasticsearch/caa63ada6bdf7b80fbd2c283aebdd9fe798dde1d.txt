Fix environment variable substitutions in list setting (#28106)

Since Elasticsearch 6.1.0 environment variable substitutions in lists do not work.
Environment variables in a list setting were not resolved, because settings with a list type were skipped during variables resolution.
This commit fixes by processing list settings as well.

Closes #27926
