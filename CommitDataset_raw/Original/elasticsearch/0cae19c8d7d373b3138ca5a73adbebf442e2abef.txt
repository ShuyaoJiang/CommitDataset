IndicesClusterStateService should replace an init. replica with an init. primary with the same aId (#32374)

In rare cases it is possible that a nodes gets an instruction to replace a replica
shard that's in `POST_RECOVERY` with a new initializing primary with the same allocation id.
This can happen by batching cluster states that include the starting of the replica, with
closing of the indices, opening it up again and allocating the primary shard to the node in
question. The node should then clean it's initializing replica and replace it with a new
initializing primary.

I'm not sure whether the test I added really adds enough value as existing tests found this. The main reason I added is to allow for simpler reproduction and to double check I fixed it. I'm open to discuss if we should keep.

Closes #32308
