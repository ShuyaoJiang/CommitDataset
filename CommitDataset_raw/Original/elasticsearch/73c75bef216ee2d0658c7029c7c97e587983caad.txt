Preserve cluster settings on full restart tests (#33590)

Today the full cluster restart tests do not preserve cluster settings on
restart. This is a mistake because it is not an accurate reflection of
reality, we do not expect users to clear cluster settings when they
perform a full cluster restart. This commit makes it so that all full
cluster restart tests preserve settings on upgrade.
