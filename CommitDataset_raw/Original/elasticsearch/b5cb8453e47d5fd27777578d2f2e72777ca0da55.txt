Remove types from internal monitoring templates and bump to api 7 (#39888)

This commit removes the "doc" type from monitoring internal indexes.
The template still carries the "_doc" type since that is needed for
the internal representation.

This change impacts the following templates:
monitoring-alerts.json
monitoring-beats.json
monitoring-es.json
monitoring-kibana.json
monitoring-logstash.json

As part of the required changes, the system_api_version has been
bumped from "6" to "7" and support for version "2" has been dropped.

A new empty pipeline is now introduced for the version "7", and
the formerly empty "6" pipeline will now remove the type and re-direct
the request to the "7" index.

Additionally, to due to a difference in the internal representation
(which requires the inclusion of "_doc" type) and external representation
(which requires the exclusion of any type) a helper method is introduced
to help convert internal to external representation, and used by the
monitoring HTTP template exporter.
