[Close Index API] Add unique UUID to ClusterBlock (#36775)

This commit adds a unique id to cluster blocks, so that they can be uniquely 
identified if needed. This is important for the Close Index API where multiple 
concurrent closing requests can be executed at the same time. By adding a 
UUID to the cluster block, we can generate unique "closing block" that can 
later be verified on shards and then checked again from the cluster state 
before closing the index. When the verification on shard is done, the closing 
block is replaced by the regular INDEX_CLOSED_BLOCK instance.

If something goes wrong, calling the Open Index API will remove the block.
