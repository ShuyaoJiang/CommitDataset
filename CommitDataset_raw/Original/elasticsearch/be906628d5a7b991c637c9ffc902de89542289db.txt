Remove implicit 32-bit support

We previously tried to maintain (while not formally supporting) 32-bit
support, although we never tested this anywhere in CI. Since we do not
formally support this, and 32-bit usage is very low, we have elected to
no longer maintain 32-bit support. This commit removes any implication
of 32-bit support.
