Reduce object creation in Rounding class (#38061)

This reduces objects creations in the rounding class (used by aggs) by properly
creating the objects only once. Furthermore a few unneeded ZonedDateTime objects
were created in order to create other objects out of them. This was
changed as well.

Running the benchmarks shows a much faster performance for all of the
java time based Rounding classes.
