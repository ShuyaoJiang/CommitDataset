Test: Convert rolling upgrade test to have task per wire compat version (#24758)

This commit changes the rolling upgrade test to create a set of rest
test tasks per wire compat version. The most recent wire compat version
is always tested with the `integTest` task, and all versions can be
tested with `bwcTest`.
