Scripted metric aggregations: add deprecation warning and system property to control legacy params (#31597)

* Scripted metric aggregations: add deprecation warning and system property to control legacy params

Scripted metric aggregation params._agg/_aggs are replaced by state/states context variables. By default the old params are still present, and a deprecation warning is emitted when Scripted Metric Aggregations are used. A new system property can be used to disable the legacy params. This functionality will be removed in a future revision.

* Fix minor style issue and docs test failure

* Disable deprecated params._agg/_aggs in tests and revise tests to use state/states instead

* Add integration test covering deprecated scripted metrics aggs params._agg/_aggs access

* Disable deprecated params._agg/_aggs in docs integration tests and revise stored scripts to use state/states instead

* Revert unnecessary migrations doc change

A relevant note should be added in the changes destined for 7.0; this PR is going to be backported to 6.x.

* Replace deprecated _agg param bwc integration test with a couple of unit tests

* Fix compatibility test after merge

* Rename backwards compatibility system property per code review feedback

* Tweak deprecation warning text per review feedback
