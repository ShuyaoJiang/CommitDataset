Fix docs failure on language analyzers (#30722)

This commit fixes docs failure on language analyzers when compared to the built in analyzers.
The `elision` filters used by the rebuilt language analyzers should be case insensitive to match
the definition of the prebuilt analyzers.

Closes #30557
