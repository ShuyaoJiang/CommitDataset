[Close Index API] Add TransportShardCloseAction for pre-closing verifications (#36249)

This pull request adds the TransportShardCloseAction which is a 
transport replication action that acquires all index shard permits for
 its execution. This action will be used in the future by the 
MetaDataIndexStateService in a new index closing process, where 
we need to execute some sanity checks before closing an index.

The action executes the following verifications on the primary and replicas:
 * there is no other on going operation active on the shard
 * the data node holding the shard knows that the index is blocked for writes
 * the shard's max sequence number is equal to the global checkpoint

When the verifications are done and successful, the shard is flushed.
