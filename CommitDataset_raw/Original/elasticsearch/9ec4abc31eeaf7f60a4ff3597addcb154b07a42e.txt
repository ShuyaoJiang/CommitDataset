Ensure date parsing BWC compatibility (#37929)

In order to retain BWC this changes the java date formatters to be able to
parse nanoseconds resolution, even if only milliseconds are supported.
This used to work on joda time as well so that a user could store a date
like `2018-10-03T14:42:44.613469+0000` and then just loose the precision
on anything lower than millisecond level.
