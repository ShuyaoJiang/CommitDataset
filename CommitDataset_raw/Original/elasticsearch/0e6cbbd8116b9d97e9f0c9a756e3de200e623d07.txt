Watcher: Ensure trigger service pauses execution (#30363)

When the watcher service pauses execution due to a cluster state update,
the trigger service and its engines also need to pause properly instead
of keeping going. This is also important when the .watches index is 
deleted, so that watches don't stay in a triggered mode.
