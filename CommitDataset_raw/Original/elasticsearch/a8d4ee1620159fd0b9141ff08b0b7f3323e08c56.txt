Remove PipelineExecutionService#executeIndexRequest (#29537)

With the move long ago to execute all single-document indexing requests
as bulk indexing request, the method
PipelineExecutionService#executeIndexRequest is unused and will never be
used in production code. This commit removes this method and cuts over
all tests to use PipelineExecutionService#executeBulkRequest.
