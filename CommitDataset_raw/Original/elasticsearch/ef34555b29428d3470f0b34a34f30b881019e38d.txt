Decouple nio constructs from the tcp transport (#27484)

This is related to #27260. Currently, basic nio constructs (nio
channels, the channel factories, selector event handlers, etc) implement
logic that is specific to the tcp transport. For example, NioChannel
implements the TcpChannel interface. These nio constructs at some point
will also need to support other protocols (ex: http).

This commit separates the TcpTransport logic from the nio building
blocks.
