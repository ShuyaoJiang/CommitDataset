Add remaining security tests (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2797)

This adds all of the security tests I think SQL is going to need for the initial release. SQL is still missing an entire scenario though: SSL enabled. Either way, this removes some `NOCOMMIT`s in `qa/sql/security`. Adding the SSL testing can come later.
