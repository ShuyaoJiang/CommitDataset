Add javadocs about expected exceptions to RestHighLevelClient (#36216)

Add a more detailed section about what exceptions to expect from the blocking
calls in this class and removing the mostly redundant mentions of the
IOExceptions from each method javadoc since it doesn't give much details about
the expected exceptions anyway.

Closes #30334
