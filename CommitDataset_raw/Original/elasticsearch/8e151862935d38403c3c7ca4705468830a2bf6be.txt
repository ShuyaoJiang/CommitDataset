Update `IndexShard#refreshMetric` via a `ReferenceManager.RefreshListener` (#25083)

The PR takes a different approach to solve #24806 than currently implemented via #25052. The `refreshMetric` that IndexShard maintains is updated using the refresh listeners infrastructure in lucene. This means that we truly count all refreshes that lucene makes and not have to worry about each individual caller (like `IndexShard@refresh` and `Engine#get()`)
