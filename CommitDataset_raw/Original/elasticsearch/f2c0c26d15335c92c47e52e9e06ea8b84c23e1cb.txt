[ML] Adjust structure finder for Joda to Java time migration (#37306)

The ML file structure finder has always reported both Joda
and Java time format strings.  This change makes the Java time
format strings the ones that are incorporated into mappings
and ingest pipeline definitions.

The BWC syntax of prepending "8" to these formats is used.
This will need to be removed once Java time format strings
become the default in Elasticsearch.

This commit also removes direct imports of Joda classes in the
structure finder unit tests.  Instead the core Joda BWC class
is used.
