Enable skipping fetching latest for BWC builds (#29497)

The BWC builds always fetch the latest from the elastic/elasticsearch
repository for the BWC branches. Yet, there are use-cases for using the
local checkout without fetching the latest. This commit enables these
use-cases by adding a tests.bwc.git.fetch.latest property to skip the
fetches.
