Add log warnings for long running event handling (#39729)

Recently we have had a number of test issues related to blocking
activity occuring on the io thread. This commit adds a log warning for
when handling event takes a >150 milliseconds. This is implemented
for the MockNioTransport which is the transport used in
ESIntegTestCase.
