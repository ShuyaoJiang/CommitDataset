Make primary-replica resync failures less lenient (#28534)

Today, failures from the primary-replica resync are ignored as the best 
effort to not mark shards as stale during the cluster restart. However
this can be problematic if replicas failed to execute resync operations
but just fine in the subsequent write operations. When this happens,
replica will miss some operations from the new primary. There are some
implications if the local checkpoint on replica can't advance because of
the missing operations.

1. The global checkpoint won't advance - this causes both primary and 
replicas keep many index commits

2. Engine on replica won't flush periodically because uncommitted stats
is calculated based on the local checkpoint

3. Replica can use a large number of bitsets to keep track operations seqno

However we can prevent this issue but still reserve the best-effort by 
failing replicas which fail to execute resync operations but not mark
them as stale. We have prepared to the required infrastructure in #28049
and #28054 for this change.
