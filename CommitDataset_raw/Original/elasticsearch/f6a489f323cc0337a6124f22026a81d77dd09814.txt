Add Log4j to SLF4J binding for repository-hdfs

This commit adds the Log4j to SLF4J binding JAR to the repository-hdfs
plugin so that SLF4J can detect Log4j at runtime and therefore use the
server Log4j implementation for logging (and the usual Elasticsearch
APIs can be used for setting logging levels).

Relates #26514
