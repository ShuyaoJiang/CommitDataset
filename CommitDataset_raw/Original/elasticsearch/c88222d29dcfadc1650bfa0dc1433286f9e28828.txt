 Stabilise testStaleMasterNotHijackingMajority (#40253)

This test inadvertently asserts that the election occurs after a master failure
is clean. However, messy elections are a fact of life so we should not fail on
a messy election.

This change moves this test away from an `AbstractDisruptionTestCase` since it
does not need the fault detector to be so enthusiastic, and weakens the
assertions to merely say that we ignore states published by the old master
without saying anything about the cleanliness of the election.
