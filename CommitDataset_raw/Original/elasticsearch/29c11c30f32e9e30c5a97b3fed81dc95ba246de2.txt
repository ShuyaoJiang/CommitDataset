Settings filter should rely directly on realm settings (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1669)

The security module had special cases for realm settings that should be filtered,
but since elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch@2c76a13 / elastic/elasticsearch#4311 it's possible to use the existing realm
setting objects to do that.
