Add OneStatementPerLineCheck to Checkstyle rules (#33682)

This change adds the OneStatementPerLineCheck to our checkstyle precommit
checks. This rule restricts the number of statements per line to one. The
resoning behind this is that it is very difficult to read multiple statements on
one line. People seem to mostly use it in short lambdas and switch statements in
our code base, but just going through the changes already uncovered some actual
problems in randomization in test code, so I think its worth it.
