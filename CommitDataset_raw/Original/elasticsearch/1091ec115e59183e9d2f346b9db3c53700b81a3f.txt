specify subdirs of lib, bin, modules in package (#32253)

Explicitly include all subdirectories of these folders in
/usr/share/elasticsearch in package distributions so that they are
managed by the package manager. This change does really have an
effect in the 7.x series, where there are no subdirectories in bin, and
we were already doing this in lib and modules. It does have an effect in
the 6.x series where the bin/x-pack subdirectory was not previously
tracked by the package manager and could be left behind on removal in
rpm distributions.
