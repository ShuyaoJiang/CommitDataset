Remove version from license file name for GCS SDK (#31221)

Most of our license file names strip the version off the artifact name
when deducing the license filename. However, the version on the GCS SDK
(google-api-services-storage) does not match the usual format and
instead starts with a vee. This means that the license filename for this
license ended up carrying the version and we should not do that. This
commit adjusts the regex the deduces the license filename to account for
this case, and adjusts the google-api-services-storage license files
accordingly.
