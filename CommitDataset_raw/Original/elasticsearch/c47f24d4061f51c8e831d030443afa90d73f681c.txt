BulkProcessor flush runnable preserves the thread context from creation time (#26718)

When using a bulk processor, the thread context was not preserved for the flush runnable which is
executed in another thread in the thread pool. This change wraps the flush runnable in a context
preserving runnable so that the headers and transients from the creation time of the bulk processor
are available during the execution of the flush.
