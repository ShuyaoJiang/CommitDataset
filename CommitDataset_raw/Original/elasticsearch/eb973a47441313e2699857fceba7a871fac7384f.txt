fix GeoHashGridTests precision parsing error

Previously, a hardcoded precision value of 4 was
used by these tests resulting in no approximation
errors. Now that the precision is between 1-12,
precision values of 1 and 2 result in potential
bucketing errors.

This commit adjusts the range to be 4-12.

Fixes #37892.
