[Zen2] Remove duplicate discovered peers (#35505)

Today the `PeerFinder` probes each address it obtains, identifies the node to
which it just connected, and then returns all such nodes. However, this can
lead to duplicates if a node manages to connect to another node via two
distinct addresses.  This causes bootstrapping to fail since
`BootstrapConfiguration#resolve` forbids duplicates.

This change alters the behaviour of the `PeerFinder` to remove duplicates in
this situation.
