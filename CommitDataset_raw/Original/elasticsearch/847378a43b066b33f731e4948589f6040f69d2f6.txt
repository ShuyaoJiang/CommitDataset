Add another parent value option to join documentation (#25609)

Indexing a join field on a document requires a value of type "object" and two sub fields "name" 
and "parent". The "parent" field is only required on child documents, but the "name" field which 
denotes the name of the relation is always needed. Previously, only the short-hand version of the 
join field was documented. This adds documentation for the long-hand join field data, and 
explicitly points out that just specifying the name of the relation for the field value is a 
convenience shortcut.
