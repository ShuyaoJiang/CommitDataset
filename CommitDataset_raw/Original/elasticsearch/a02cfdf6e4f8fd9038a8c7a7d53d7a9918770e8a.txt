Switch InternalTestClusterTests to zen2 (#36977)

Today InternalTestClusterTests is still using zen1.
This commit fixes it.
Two types of changes were required:

1. Explicitly pass file discovery host provider setting. It's done in
ESIntegTestCase as a part of the Zen2 feature and should be done here
as well.
2. For the test, that uses autoManageMinMasterNodes = false perform
cluster bootstrap.
