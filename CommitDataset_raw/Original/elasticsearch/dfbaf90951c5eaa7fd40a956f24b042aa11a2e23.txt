Adds ToXContentFragment (#25771)

* Adds ToXContentFragment

This interface is meant for objects that implement `ToXContent` but are not complete objects. It is basically the opposite of `ToXContentObject`. It means that it will be easier to track the migration of classes over to the fragment/not fragment ToXContent model as it will be clear which classes are not migrated. When no classes directly implement `ToXContent` we can make `ToXContent` package private to be sure that all new classes must implement `ToXContentObject` or `ToXContentFragment`.
