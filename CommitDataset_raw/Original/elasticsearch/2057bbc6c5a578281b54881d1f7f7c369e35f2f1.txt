Scripting: Remove unnecessary intermediate script compilation methods on QueryShardContext (#25093)

This commit removes wrapper methods on QueryShardContext used to compile
scripts. Instead, the script service is made accessible in the context,
and calls to compile can be made directly. This will ease transition to
each of those location becoming their own context, since they would no
longer be able to expect the same script class type.
