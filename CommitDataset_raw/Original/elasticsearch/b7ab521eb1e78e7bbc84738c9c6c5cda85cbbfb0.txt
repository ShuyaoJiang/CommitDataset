Throw AssertionError when no master (#38432)

Today we throw a fatal `RuntimeException` if an exception occurs in
`getMasterName()`, and this includes the case where there is currently no
master. However, sometimes we call this method inside an `assertBusy()` in
order to allow for a cluster that is in the process of stabilising and electing
a master. The trouble is that `assertBusy()` only retries on an
`AssertionError` and not on a general `RuntimeException`, so the lack of a
master is immediately fatal.

This commit fixes the issue by asserting there is a master, triggering a retry
if there is not.

Fixes #38331
