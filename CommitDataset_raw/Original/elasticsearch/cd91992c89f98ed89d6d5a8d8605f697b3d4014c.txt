Only fetch mapping updates when necessary (#33182)

Today we fetch the mapping from the leader and apply it as a mapping
update whenever the index metadata version on the leader changes. Yet,
the index metadata can change for many reasons other than a mapping
update (e.g., settings updates, adding an alias, or a replica being
promoted to a primary among many other reasons). This commit builds on
the addition of a mapping version to the index metadata to only fetch
mapping updates when the mapping version increases. This reduces the
number of these fetches and application of mappings on the follower to
the bare minimum.
