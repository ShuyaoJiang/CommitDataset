Avoid creating a green index in RetentionLeaseIT (#39347)

In #39224 we made shard history retention lease syncing ignore the
`index.write.wait_for_active_shards` setting on the index, and added a test
that showed that it was ignored. However the test as merged actually creates a
green index, so the `wait_for_active_shards` setting has no effect. This change
adjusts the test to create a yellow index to verify that
`wait_for_active_shards` really is ignored.
