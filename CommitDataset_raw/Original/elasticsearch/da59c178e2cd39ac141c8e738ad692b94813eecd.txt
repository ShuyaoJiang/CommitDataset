Emit settings deprecation logging at most once

When a setting is deprecated, if that setting is used repeatedly we
currently emit a deprecation warning every time the setting is used. In
cases like hitting settings endpoints over and over against a node with
a lot of deprecated settings, this can lead to excessive deprecation
warnings which can crush a node. This commit ensures that a given
setting only sees deprecation logging at most once.
