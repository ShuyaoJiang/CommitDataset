Upgrade to a Lucene 8 snapshot (#33310)

The main benefit of the upgrade for users is the search optimization for top scored documents when the total hit count is not needed. However this optimization is not activated in this change, there is another issue opened to discuss how it should be integrated smoothly.
Some comments about the change:
* Tests that can produce negative scores have been adapted but we need to forbid them completely: #33309

Closes #32899
