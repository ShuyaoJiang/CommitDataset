Build: Remove pom generation for plugin zip files (#32180)

In 1.x and 2.x, plugins were published to maven and the plugin
installer downloaded them from there. This was later changed to install
from the download service, and in 5.0 plugin zips were no longer
published to maven. However, the build still currently produces an
unused pom file. This is troublesome in the special case when the main
jar of a plugin needs to be published (and thus needs a pom file of
the same name).
