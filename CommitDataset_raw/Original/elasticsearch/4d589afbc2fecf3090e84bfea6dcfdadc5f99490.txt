AbstractQueryBuilder to no longer extend ToXContentBytes (#25948)

ToXContentToBytes is used as a base class that adds toString and buildAsBytes method implementation to classes that implement ToXContent. With the ongoing cleanups, this class is limited and doesn't add a lot of value, given that buildAsBytes can be replaced with XContentHelper.toXContent and toString can be replaced with Strings.toString(this).

The plan would be to remove ToXContentToBytes entirely, and AbstractQueryBuilder is the first place where we can remove its usage.
