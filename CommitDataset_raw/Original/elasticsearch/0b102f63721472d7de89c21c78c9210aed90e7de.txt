[TEST] Fix testOpenWaitingForActiveShardsFailed

This test periodically fails if the nodes that apply the cluster state fail to ack the change within 100ms. This commit changes the checks on the test so that
it still checks that the open command has taken effect, but that the wait for active shards has actually failed.
