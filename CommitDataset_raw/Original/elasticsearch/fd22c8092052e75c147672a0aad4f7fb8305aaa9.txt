Fix security index auto-create and state recovery race (#39582)

Previously, the security index could be wrongfully recreated. This might
happen if the index was interpreted as missing, as in the case of a fresh
install, but the index existed and the state did not yet recover.

This fix will return HTTP SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE (503) for requests that
try to write to the security index before the state has not been recovered yet.
