Get short path name for native controllers

Due to limitations with CreateProcessW on Windows (ultimately used by
ProcessBuilder) with respect to maximum path lengths, we need to get the
short path name for any native controllers before trying to start them
in case the absolute path exceeds the maximum path length. This commit
uses JNA to invoke the necessary Windows API for this to start the
native controller using the short path.

To be precise about the limitation here, the MSDN docs for
CreateProcessW say for the command line parameter:

>The command line to be executed. The maximum length of this string is
>32,768 characters, including the Unicode terminating null character. If
>lpApplicationName is NULL, the module name portionof lpCommandLine is
>limited to MAX_PATH characters.

This is exactly how the Windows implementation of Process in the JDK
invokes CreateProcessW: with the executable name (lpApplicationName) set
to NULL.
