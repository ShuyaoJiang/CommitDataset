More "normalization" to es-norms

Turned on checkstyle but turned off line length for sql because
now is not the time. That caught a few things like redundant
modifiers, out of order modifiers, and multiple top level classes
per file. Fixing them gave me a great little tour. So I'm going to
go and do the same in the plugin code now.
