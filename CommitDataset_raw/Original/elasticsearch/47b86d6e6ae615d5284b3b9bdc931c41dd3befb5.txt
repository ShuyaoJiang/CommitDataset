[CCR] Changed AutoFollowCoordinator to keep track of certain statistics (#33684)

The following stats are being kept track of:
1) The total number of times that auto following a leader index succeed.
2) The total number of times that auto following a leader index failed.
3) The total number of times that fetching a remote cluster state failed.
4) The most recent 256 auto follow failures per auto leader index
   (e.g. create_and_follow api call fails) or cluster alias
   (e.g. fetching remote cluster state fails).

Each auto follow run now produces a result that is being used to update
the stats being kept track of in AutoFollowCoordinator.
