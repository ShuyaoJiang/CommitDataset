[ML] Tighten up use of aliases rather than concrete indices (#37874)

We have read and write aliases for the ML results indices.  However,
the job still had methods that purported to reliably return the name
of the concrete results index being used by the job.  After reindexing
prior to upgrade to 7.x this will be wrong, so the method has been
renamed and the comments made more explicit to say the returned index
name may not be the actual concrete index name for the lifetime of the
job.  Additionally, the selection of indices when deleting the job
has been changed so that it works regardless of concrete index names.

All these changes are nice-to-have for 6.7 and 7.0, but will become
critical if we add rolling results indices in the 7.x release stream
as 6.7 and 7.0 nodes may have to operate in a mixed version cluster
that includes a version that can roll results indices.
