Watcher: Do not pause watcher if not needed (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1681)

This introduces a check to only pause the execution of watcher
when there is no metadata but there was a shard on this node before
that inside of the ClusterStateListener.

This prevents repeated logging that watcher was paused even
though it was not necessary to call anything.
