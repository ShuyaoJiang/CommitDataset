Remove BouncyCastle dependency from runtime (#32193)

* Remove BouncyCastle dependency from runtime

This commit introduces a new gradle  project that contains
 the classes that have a dependency on BouncyCastle. For 
the default distribution, It builds  a jar from those and
 in puts it in a subdirectory of lib
 (/tools/security-cli) along with the BouncyCastle jars. 
This directory is then passed in the
ES_ADDITIONAL_CLASSPATH_DIRECTORIES of the CLI tools 
that use these classes.

BouncyCastle is removed as a runtime dependency (remains
as a compileOnly one) from x-pack core and x-pack security.
