Search: Simply SingleFieldsVisitor (#34052)

`SingleFieldsVisitor` is meant to load a single stored field but it
manages to be quite complex to reason about because it inherits from our
"basic" `FieldsVisitor` which is designed to load many fields. This
breaks that inheritance and adds logic to `SingleFieldsVisitor` so it can
be properly stand alone. While this amounts to more lines of code they
ought to be significantly easier to reason about.
