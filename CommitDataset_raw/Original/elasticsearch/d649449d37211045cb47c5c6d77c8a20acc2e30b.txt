[TEST] Put options that enable assertions earlier on command line (#29395)

This change moves the -ea and -esa options that enable assertions for
test nodes before the cluster-specific JVM arguments on the Java command
line.  This opens up the possibility for the cluster-specific JVM
arguments to disable assertions for one particular package or class,
which can be useful in BWC testing where incorrect assertions cannot be
removed from released versions of the product.
