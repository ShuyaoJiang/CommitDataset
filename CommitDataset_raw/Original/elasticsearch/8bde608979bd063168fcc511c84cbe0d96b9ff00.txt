Register CcrRepository based on settings update (#36086)

This commit adds an empty CcrRepository snapshot/restore repository.
When a new cluster is registered in the remote cluster settings, a new
CcrRepository is registered for that cluster.

This is implemented using a new concept of "internal repositories".
RepositoryPlugin now allows implementations to return factories for
"internal repositories". The "internal repositories" are different from
normal repositories in that they cannot be registered through the
external repository api. Additionally, "internal repositories" are local
to a node and are not stored in the cluster state.

The repository will be unregistered if the remote cluster is removed.
