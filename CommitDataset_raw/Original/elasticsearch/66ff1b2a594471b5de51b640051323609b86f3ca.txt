Tests: Wipe cluster settings after every test (#28410)

Cluster settings shouldn't leak into the next test.

I played with failing the test if it left over any settings but that
felt like it added more ceremony then it was worth. The advantage is
that any test that intentionally wants to leave settings in place after
the test would fail and require looking at but, so far as I can tell, we
don't have any such tests.
