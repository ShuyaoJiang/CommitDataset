[ML] Preview of datafeed with aggs should respect chunking config (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4241)

While it makes sense to apply auto-chunking in order to limit
the time range of the search for previewing datafeeds without aggs,
the same is not the case when aggs are used. In contrary, we should
do the preview the same way it would be if the datafeed run, as this
can reveal problems with regard to the datafeed configuration.

In addition, by default datafeeds with aggs have a manual chunking config
that limits the cost of each search. So, setting the chunking to auto
in those cases may lead to the datafeed preview failing even though
actually running the datafeed would work fine.
