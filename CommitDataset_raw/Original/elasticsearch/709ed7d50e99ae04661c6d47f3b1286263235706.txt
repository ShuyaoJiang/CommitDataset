Watcher: Only try to load triggered watches index, if it exists (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1569)

This is mainly a commit to reduce noise in test logfiles when going
through them. When watcher shuts down and another node takes over, it
might try to start watcher again and tries to load triggered watches.
However the triggered watches index could be gone in the meantime due to
further shutdown. This results in logging a stack trace that the index
does not exist.

This commit checks the cluster state before trying to load triggered
watches to prevent an IndexNotFoundException in the logs.
