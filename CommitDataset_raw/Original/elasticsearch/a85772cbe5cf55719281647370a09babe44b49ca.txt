Use Gradle wrapper when building BWC

This commit modifies the BWC build to invoke the Gradle wrapper. The
motivation for this is two-fold:
 - BWC versions might be dependent on a different version of Gradle than
   the current version of Gradle
 - in a follow-up we are going to need to be able to set JAVA_HOME to a
   different value than the current value of JAVA_HOME
