Use proper Java version for BWC builds (#29493)

Today we have JAVA_HOME for the compiler Java home and RUNTIME_JAVA_HOME
for the test Java home. However, when we compile BWC nodes and run them,
neither of these Java homes might be the version that was suitable for
that BWC node (e.g., 5.6 requires JDK 8 to compile and to run). This
commit adds support for the environment variables JAVA\d+_HOME and uses
the appropriate Java home based on the version of the node being
started. We even do this for reindex-from-old which requires JDK 7 for
these very old nodes. Note that these environment variables are not
required if not running BWC tests, and they are strictly required if
running BWC tests.
