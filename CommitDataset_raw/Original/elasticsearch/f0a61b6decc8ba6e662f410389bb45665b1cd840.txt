Security for _field_names field should not override field statistics (#33261)

In Lucene 8 the statistics for a field (doc_count, sum_doc_count, ...) are
checked and invalid values (v < 0) are rejected. Though for the _field_names
field we hide the statistics of the field if security is enabled since
some terms (field names) may be filtered. However this statistics are never
used, this field is not used for ranking and cannot be used to generate
term vectors. For these reasons this commit restores the original statistics
for the field in order to be compliant with Lucene 8.
