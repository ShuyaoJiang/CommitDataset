SQL: Allow H2-based tests to run only with Gregorian calendar (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3170)

This PR detects non-gregorian calendars in H2 tests and overrides them. This is a temporary workaround to reduce amount of noise in CI. The permanent solution is tracked in elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3169.
