Improve testcluster distribution artifact handling (#38933)

This commit moves validation logic for ensuring our testclusters
configuration doesn't contain unexpected artifacts into the plugin
itself. This change allows us to remove the custom copy task
implementation altogether.

Additionally, the error message has been improved to display component
ids in addition to the artifacts to make it easier to figure out what
actual dependency is at fault.
