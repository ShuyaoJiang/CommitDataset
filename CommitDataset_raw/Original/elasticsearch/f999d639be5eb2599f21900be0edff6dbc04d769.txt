Update platforms tests to use Gradle wrapper

Gradle will no longer be needed in the test VMs as the Gradle wrapper
can be used to run the platform tests. This commit updates the platform
tests to use the Gradle wrapper, and removes installing Gradle in the VM
which will speed up VM provisioning.
