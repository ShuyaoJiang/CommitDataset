Updated docs for cross-cluster search (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1478)

* Updated docs for cross-cluster search

Wildcards are now supported in both cluster alias and index name,
and the "view_index_metadata" privilege is automatically conferred
by the "read_cross_cluster" role.

* For now, best to allow users permissions to query all indices on all remote clusters
