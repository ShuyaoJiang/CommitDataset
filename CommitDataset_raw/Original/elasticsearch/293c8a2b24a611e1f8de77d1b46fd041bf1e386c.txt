Painless: Add an Ingest Script Processor Example (#32302)

This commit adds two pieces. The first is a small set of documentation providing 
instructions on how to get setup to run context examples. This will require a download 
similar to how Kibana works for some of the examples. The second is an ingest processor 
example using the downloaded data. More examples will follow as ideally one per PR. 
This also adds a set of tests to individually test each script as a unit test.
