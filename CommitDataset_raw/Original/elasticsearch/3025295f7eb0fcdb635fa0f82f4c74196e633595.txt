Decouple Text and Geopoint from XContentBuilder (#29119)

This removes the `Text` and `Geopoint` special handling from `XContentBuilder`.
Instead, these classes now implement `ToXContentFragment` and render themselves
accordingly.

This allows us to further decouple XContentBuilder from Elasticsearch-specific
classes so it can be factored into a standalone lib at a later time.
