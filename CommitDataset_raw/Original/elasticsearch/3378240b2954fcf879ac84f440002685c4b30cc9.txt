Reload secure settings for plugins (#31383)

Adds the ability to reread and decrypt the local node keystore.
Commonly, the contents of the keystore, backing the `SecureSettings`,
are not retrievable except during node initialization. This changes that
by adding a new API which broadcasts a password to every node. The
password is used to decrypt the local keystore and use it to populate
a `Settings` object that is passes to all the plugins implementing the
`ReloadablePlugin` interface. The plugin is then responsible to do
whatever "reload" means in his case. When the `reload`handler returns,
the keystore is closed and its contents are no longer retrievable.
Password is never stored persistently on any node.
Plugins that have been moded in this commit are: `repository-azure`,
`repository-s3`, `repository-gcs` and `discovery-ec2`.
