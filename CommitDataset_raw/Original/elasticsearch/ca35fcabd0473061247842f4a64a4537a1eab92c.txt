Do not set SO_LINGER to 0 when not shutting down (#26871)

This is a follow up to #26764. That commit set SO_LINGER to 0 in order
to fix a scenario where we were running out of resources during CI. We
are primarily interested in setting this to 0 when stopping the
tranport. Allowing TIMED_WAIT is standard for other failure scenarios
during normal operation.

Unfortunately this commit set SO_LINGER to 0 every time we close
NodeChannels. NodeChannels can be closed in case of an exception or
other failures (such as parsing a response). We want to only disable
linger when actually shutting down.
