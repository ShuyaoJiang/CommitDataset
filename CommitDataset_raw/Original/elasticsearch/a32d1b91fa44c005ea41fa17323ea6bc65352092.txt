Remove comma-separated feature parsing for GetIndicesAction

This removes the parsing of things like `GET /idx/_aliases,_mappings`, instead,
a user must choose between retriving all index metadata with `GET /idx`, or only
a specific form such as `GET /idx/_settings`.

Relates to (and is a prerequisite of) #24437
