Remove -Xlint exclusions in all plugins. (#40721)

The xlint exclusions of the following plugins were removed:
* ingest-attachment.
* mapper-size.
* transport-nio. Removing the -try exclusion required some work, because
  the NettyAdaptor implements AutoCloseable and NettyAdaptor#close() method
  could throw an InterruptedException (ChannelFuture#await() and a generic
  Exception is re-thrown, which maybe an ChannelFuture). The easiest way
  around this to me seemed that NettyAdaptor should not implement AutoCloseable,
  because it is not directly used in a try-with-resources statement.
