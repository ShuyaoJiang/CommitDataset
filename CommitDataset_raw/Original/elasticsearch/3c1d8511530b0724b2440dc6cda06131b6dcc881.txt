Fix so non super users can also create API keys (#40028)

When creating API keys we check for if API key with
the same key name already exists and fail the request if it does.
The check should have been performed with XPackSecurityUser
instead of the authenticated user. This caused the request to fail
in case of the non-super user trying to create an API key.
This commit fixes by executing search action with SECURITY_ORIGIN
so it can be executed with XPackSecurityUser.
Also fixed the Rest test to avoid using a user with `super_user` role.

Closes #40029
