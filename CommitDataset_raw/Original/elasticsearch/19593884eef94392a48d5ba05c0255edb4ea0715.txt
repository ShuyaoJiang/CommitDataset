[Close Index API] Propagate tasks ids between Freeze, Close and Verify Shard actions (#36630)

This pull request changes the Freeze Index and Close Index actions so 
that these actions always requires a Task. The task's id is then propagated 
from the Freeze action to the Close action, and then to the Verify shard action. 
This way it is possible to track which Freeze task initiates the closing of an index, 
and which consecutive verifiy shard are executed for the index closing.
