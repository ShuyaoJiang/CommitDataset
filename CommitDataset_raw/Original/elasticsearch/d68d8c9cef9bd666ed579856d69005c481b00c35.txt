Expose duplicate removal in the completion suggester (#26496)

This change exposes the duplicate removal option added in Lucene for the completion suggester
with a new option called `skip_duplicates` (defaults to false).
This commit also adapts the custom suggest collector to handle deduplication when multiple contexts match the input.

Closes #23364
