Simplify Engine.Searcher creation (#28728)

Today we have several levels of indirection to acquire an Engine.Searcher.
We first acquire a the reference manager for the scope then acquire an
IndexSearcher and then create a searcher for the engine based on that.
This change simplifies the creation into a single method call instead of
3 different ones.
