Create specific exception for when snapshots are in progress (#37550)

delete and close index actions threw IllegalArgumentExceptions
when attempting to run against an index that has a snapshot
in progress.

This change introduces a dedicated SnapshotInProgressException
for these scenarios. This is done to explicitly signal to clients that
this is the reason the action failed, and it is a retryable error.

relates to #37541.
