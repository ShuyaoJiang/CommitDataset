[ILM] Fix Move To Step API causing ILM to hang (#34618)

The Move To Step API now checks to see if the target step is an
AsyncActionStep, and if so, runs it.

Previously, AsyncActionSteps would only be run when they are entered by
executing the previous step, so if an AsyncActionStep was entered via
the Move To Step API, ILM would never touch that index again.
