 Ensure local addresses aren't null (#31440)

Currently we set local addresses on the creation time of a NioChannel.
However, this may return null as the local address may not have been
set yet. An example is the local address has not been set on a client
channel as the connection process is not yet complete.

This PR modifies the getter to set the local field if it is currently null.
