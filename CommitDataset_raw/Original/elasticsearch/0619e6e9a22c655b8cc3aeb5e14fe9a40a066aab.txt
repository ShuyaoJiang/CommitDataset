Optimize Bulk Message Parsing and Message Length Parsing (#39634)

* Optimize Bulk Message Parsing and Message Length Parsing

* findNextMarker took almost 1ms per invocation during the PMC rally track
  * Fixed to be about an order of magnitude faster by using Netty's bulk `ByteBuf` search
* It is unnecessary to instantiate an object (the input stream wrapper) and throw it away, just to read the `int` length from the message bytes
  * Fixed by adding bulk `int` read to BytesReference
