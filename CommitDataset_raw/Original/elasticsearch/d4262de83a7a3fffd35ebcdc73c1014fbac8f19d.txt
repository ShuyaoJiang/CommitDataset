[Docs] All Rollup docs experimental, agg limitations, clarify DeleteJob (#31299)

- All rollup pages should be marked as experimental instead of just
the top page
- While the job config docs state which aggregations are allowed, adding
a section which specifically details this in one place is more convenient
for the user
- Add a clarification that the DeleteJob API does not delete the rollup
data, just the rollup job.
