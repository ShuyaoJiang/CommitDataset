Scripting: Rework joda time backcompat (#33486)

This commit switches the joda time backcompat in scripting to use
augmentation over ZonedDateTime. The augmentation methods provide
compatibility with the missing methods between joda's DateTime and
java's ZonedDateTime. Due to getDayOfWeek returning an enum in the java
API, ZonedDateTime is wrapped so that the method can return int like the
joda time does. The java time api version is renamed to
getDayOfWeekEnum, which will be kept through 7.x for compatibility while
users switch back to getDayOfWeek once joda compatibility is removed.
