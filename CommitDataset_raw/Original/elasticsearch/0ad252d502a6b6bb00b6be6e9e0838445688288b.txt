change default indices.lifecycle.poll_interval to something sane (#32521)

This was originally set to a few seconds while prototyping things.
This interval is for the scheduled trigger of policies. Policies
have this extra trigger beyond just on cluster-state changes because
cluster-state changes may not be happeneing in a cluster for
whatever reason, and we need to continue making progress. Updating
this value to be larger is reasonable since not all operations
are expected to be completed in the span of seconds, but instead in
minutes and hours. 10 minutes is sane.
