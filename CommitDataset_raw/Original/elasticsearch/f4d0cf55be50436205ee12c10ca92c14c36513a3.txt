Update packaging tests to work with meta plugins (#28336)

The current install_plugin() does not play well with meta plugins because 
it always checks for the plugin's descriptor file.

This commit changes the install_plugin() so that it only runs the install plugin 
command and lets the caller verify that the required files are correctly installed. 
It also adds a install_meta_plugin() function to install meta plugins.
