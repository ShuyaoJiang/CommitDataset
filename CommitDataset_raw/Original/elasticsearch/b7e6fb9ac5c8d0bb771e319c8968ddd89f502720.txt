[test] remove Streamable serde assertions (#29307)

Removes a set of assertions in the test framework that verified that
Streamable objects could be serialized and deserialized across different
versions. When this was discussed the consensus was that this approach
has not caught many bugs in a long time and that serialization testing of
objects was best left to their respective unit and integration tests.

This commit also removes a transport interceptor that was used in
ESIntegTestCase tests to make these assertions about objects coming in
or off the wire.
