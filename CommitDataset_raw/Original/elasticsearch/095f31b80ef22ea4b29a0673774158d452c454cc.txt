Replica start peer recovery with safe commit (#28181)

Today a replica starts a peer-recovery with the last commit. If the last
commit is not a safe commit, a replica will immediately fallback to the
file based sync which is more expensive than the sequence based
recovery. This commit modifies the peer-recovery in replica to start
with a safe commit. Moreover we can keep the existing translog on the
target if the recovery is sequence based recovery.
