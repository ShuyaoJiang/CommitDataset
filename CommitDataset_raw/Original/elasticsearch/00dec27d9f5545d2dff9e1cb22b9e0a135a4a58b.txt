SQL: Relax RemoteFailure parsing so that it also parses error metadata (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3938)

The current parsing of errors in the RemoteFailure class is strict and
fails on any field that is not one of [caused_by, reason, root_cause,
stack_trace, type]. Sadly some exceptions adds more headers or
metadata when they are printed as XContent and such fields can't be
easily ignored at parsing time.

This commit changes the RemoteFailure.parseFromResponse() method so that
it parses errors using the same behavior as the high level rest client:
it parses any unknown field as a metadata if it's string value or an
array of string and just ignores and skips everything else without
throwing an exception.
