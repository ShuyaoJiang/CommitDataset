SQL: Fix fulltext CSV spec tests (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2608)

Column type autodetect of integer types is broken in JDBC CSV library when it is used in tr-TR locale. The library is using toLowerCase() calls with default locale, which causes it to convert autodetected type name "Int" to lowercase "Ä±nt" in tr-TR locale and not recognize it as an int type afterwards.

This commit adds a temporary workaround that makes the prevents that test from failing by specifying explicit column types in all tests where integer columns are present.
