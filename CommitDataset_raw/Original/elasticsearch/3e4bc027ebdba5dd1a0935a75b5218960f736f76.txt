RestClient uses system properties and system default SSLContext (#25757)

This commit calls the `useSystemProperties` method on the HttpAsyncClientBuilder so that the jvm
system properties are used. The primary reason for doing this is to ensure the builder uses the
system default SSLContext rather than the default instance created by the http client library.

Closes #23231
