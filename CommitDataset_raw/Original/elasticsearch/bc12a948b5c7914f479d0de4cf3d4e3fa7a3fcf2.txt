Checkstyle: Package declarations (#33784)

Make sure that all java files have a package declaration and that all of
the package declarations line up with the directory structure. This
would have caught the bug that I caused in
190ea9a6def9082348d983b16420ef02607d4c17 and fixed in
b6d68bd805f1858a0210e381402236dea1d42509.
