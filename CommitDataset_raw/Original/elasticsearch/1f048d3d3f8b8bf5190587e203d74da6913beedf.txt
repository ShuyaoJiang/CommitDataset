Remove unneeded listener on MoveToNextStepUpdateTask (#33725)

There was a listener that re-runs the policy with the new state when the cluster
state is processed by the `MoveToNextStepUpdateTask`. This removes this listener
as we will execute the policy through the `IndexLifecyleService` cluster state
listener.
