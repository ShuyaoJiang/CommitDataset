Decouple NamedXContentRegistry from ElasticsearchException (#29253)

* Decouple NamedXContentRegistry from ElasticsearchException

This commit decouples `NamedXContentRegistry` from using either
`ElasticsearchException`, `ParsingException`, or `UnknownNamedObjectException`.

This will allow us to move NamedXContentRegistry to its own lib as part of the
xcontent extraction work.
