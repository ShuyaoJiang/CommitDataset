Introduce soft-deletes retention policy based on global checkpoint (#30335)

This commit introduces a soft-deletes retention merge policy based on
the global checkpoint. Some notes on this simple retention policy:

- This policy keeps all operations whose seq# is greater than the 
persisted global checkpoint and configurable extra operations prior to
the global checkpoint. This is good enough for querying history changes.

- This policy is not watertight for peer-recovery. We send the 
safe-commit in peer-recovery, thus we need to also send all operations
after the local checkpoint of that commit. This is analog to the min
translog generation for recovery.

- This policy is too simple to support rollback.
