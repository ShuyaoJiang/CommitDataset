Tests: Check watcher state before starting/stopping (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4362)

This changes the behaviour of AbstractWatcherIntegrationTestCase and its
startWatcher/stopWatcher methods. Instead of checking for the target
state and just starting or stopping if it does not match, the methods
now wait for certain states to be reached before starting or stopping.

This will fix test failures where a failure is started instead of
stopped or vice versa.
