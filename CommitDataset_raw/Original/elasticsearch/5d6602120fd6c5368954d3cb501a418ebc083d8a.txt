[Zen2] Hide not recovered state (#36224)

This commit hides ClusterStates that have a STATE_NOT_RECOVERED_BLOCK from
ClusterStateAppliers. This is needed, because some appliers, such as IngestService, rely on
the fact, that cluster states with STATE_NOT_RECOVERED_BLOCK won't contain anything useful.
Once the state is recovered it's fully available for the appliers. This commit also switches many of
the remaining tests that require state persistence/recovery from Zen1 to Zen2.
