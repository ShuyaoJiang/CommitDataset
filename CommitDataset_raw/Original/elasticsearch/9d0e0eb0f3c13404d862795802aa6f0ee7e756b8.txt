[Zen2] Remove initial master node count setting (#37150)

The `cluster.unsafe_initial_master_node_count` setting was introduced as a
temporary measure while the design of `cluster.initial_master_nodes` was being
finalised. This commit removes this temporary setting, replacing it with usages
of `cluster.initial_master_nodes` where appropriate.
