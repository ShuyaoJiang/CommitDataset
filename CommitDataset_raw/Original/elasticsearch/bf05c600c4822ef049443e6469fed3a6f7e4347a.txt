REST: Include suppressed exceptions on failures (#29115)

This modifies xcontent serialization of Exceptions to contain suppressed
exceptions. If there are any suppressed exceptions they are included in
the exception response by default. The reasoning here is that they are
fairly rare but when they exist they almost always add extra useful
information. Take, for example, the response when you specify two broken
ingest pipelines:

```
{
  "error" : {
    "root_cause" : ...snip...
    "type" : "parse_exception",
    "reason" : "[field] required property is missing",
    "header" : {
      "processor_type" : "set",
      "property_name" : "field"
    },
    "suppressed" : [
      {
        "type" : "parse_exception",
        "reason" : "[field] required property is missing",
        "header" : {
          "processor_type" : "convert",
          "property_name" : "field"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "status" : 400
}
```

Moreover, when suppressed exceptions come from 500 level errors should
give us more useful debugging information.

Closes #23392
