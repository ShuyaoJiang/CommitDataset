[ML] Prevent submit after autodetect worker is stopped (#37700)

Runnables can be submitted to
AutodetectProcessManager.AutodetectWorkerExecutorService
without error after it has been shutdown which can lead
to requests timing out as their handlers are never called
by the terminated executor.

This change throws an EsRejectedExecutionException if a
runnable is submitted after after the shutdown and calls
AbstractRunnable.onRejection on any tasks not run.

Closes #37108
