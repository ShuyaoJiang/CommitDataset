Get jdbc tests passing

`gradle check -xforbiddenPatterns` now passes in jdbc.

This makes running the embedded HTTP server slightly more difficult,
you now have to add the following to your jvm arguments.
```
-ea -Dtests.rest.cluster=localhost:9200 -Dtests.embed.sql=true -Dtests.security.manager=false
```

Depending on your environment the embedded jdbc connection may give
spurious failures that look like:
```
org.elasticsearch.xpack.sql.jdbc.jdbc.JdbcException: RemoteTransportException[[node-0][127.0.0.1:9300][indices:data/read/search]]; nested: SearchPhaseExecutionException[]; nested: GeneralScriptException[Failed to compile inline script [( params.a0 > params.v0 ) && ( params.a1 > params.v1 )] using lang [painless]]; nested: CircuitBreakingException[[script] Too many dynamic script compilations within one minute, max: [15/min]; please use on-disk, indexed, or scripts with parameters instead; this limit can be changed by the [script.max_compilations_per_minute] setting];
...

```

`gradle check` works around this by setting `script.max_compilations_per_minute`
to `1000`.

Another change is that we no longer support loading the test data by
uncommenting some code. Instead we load the test data into Elaticsearch
before the first test and we deleted it after the last test. This is
so that tests that required different test data can interoperate with
eachother. The spec tests all use the same test data but the metadata
tests do not.
