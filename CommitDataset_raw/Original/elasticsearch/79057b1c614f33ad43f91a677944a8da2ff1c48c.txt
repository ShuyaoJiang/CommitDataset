[Test] Extending checks for Suggestion parsing (#25132)

When parsing responses we should be ignoring any new unknown fields or inner
objects in most cases to be forward compatible with changes in core on the
client side. This change adds test for this for Suggestions and its various
subclasses to check if we are able to ignore new fields and objects in the
xContent.
