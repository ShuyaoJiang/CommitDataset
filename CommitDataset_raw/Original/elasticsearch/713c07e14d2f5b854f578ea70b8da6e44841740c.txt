Add early termination support to BucketCollector (#33279)

This commit adds the support to early terminate the collection of a leaf
in the aggregation framework. This change introduces a MultiBucketCollector which
handles CollectionTerminatedException exactly like the Lucene MultiCollector.
Any aggregator can now throw a CollectionTerminatedException without stopping
the collection of a sibling aggregator. This is useful for aggregators that
can infer their result without visiting all documents (e.g.: a min/max aggregation on a match_all query).
