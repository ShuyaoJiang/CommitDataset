Blob store compression fix (#39073)

Blob store compression was not enabled for some of the files in
snapshots due to constructor accessing sub-class fields. Fixed to
instead accept compress field as constructor param. Also fixed chunk
size validation to work.

Deprecated repositories.fs.compress setting as well to be able to unify
in a future commit.
