HLRC: Create server agnostic request and response (#32912)

The HLRC has historically reused the same Request and Response classes
that the server module uses. This commit deprecates the use of any
server module Request and Response classes, and adds a small bit of
validation logic that differs from server slightly, in that it does not
assume a check for a null ValidationException class is not enough to
determine if validation failed.
