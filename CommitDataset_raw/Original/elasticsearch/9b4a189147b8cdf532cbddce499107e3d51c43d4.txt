Add purge option to remove plugin CLI

By default, the remove plugin CLI command preserves configuration
files. This is so that if a user is upgrading the plugin (which is done
by first removing the old version and then installing the new version)
they do not lose their configuration file. Yet, there are circumstances
where preserving the configuration file is not desired. This commit adds
a purge option to the remove plugin CLI command.
