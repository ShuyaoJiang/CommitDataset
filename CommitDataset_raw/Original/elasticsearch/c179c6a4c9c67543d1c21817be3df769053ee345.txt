Add assertions enabled helper

Today in the code base we have lots of ugly code blocks like:

  boolean assertionsEnabled = false;
  assert assertionsEnabled = true;
  if (assertionsEnabled) {
    // something
  }

These are a nuisance. Instead, we can do this in exactly one place and
replace these blocks with

  if (Assertions.ENABLED) {
    // something
  }

The cool thing here is that since this is a static final field, the JIT
can optimize away the check at runtime if assertions are disabled.
