CCR: Rename follow-task parameters and stats (#34836)

* CCR: Rename follow parameters and stats

This commit renames the follow-task parameters and its stats.
Below are the changes:

## Params
- remote_cluster (unchanged)
- leader_index (unchanged)
- max_read_request_operation_count -> max_read_request_operation_count
- max_batch_size -> max_read_request_size
- max_write_request_operation_count (new)
- max_write_request_size (new)
- max_concurrent_read_batches -> max_outstanding_read_requests
- max_concurrent_write_batches -> max_outstanding_write_requests
- max_write_buffer_size (unchanged)
- max_write_buffer_count (unchanged)
- max_retry_delay (unchanged)
- poll_timeout -> read_poll_timeout

## Stats
- remote_cluster (unchanged)
- leader_index (unchanged)
- follower_index (unchanged)
- shard_id (unchanged)
- leader_global_checkpoint (unchanged)
- leader_max_seq_no (unchanged)
- follower_global_checkpoint (unchanged)
- follower_max_seq_no (unchanged)
- last_requested_seq_no (unchanged)
- number_of_concurrent_reads -> outstanding_read_requests
- number_of_concurrent_writes -> outstanding_write_requests
- buffer_size_in_bytes -> write_buffer_size_in_bytes (new)
- number_of_queued_writes -> write_buffer_operation_count
- mapping_version -> follower_mapping_version
- total_fetch_time_millis -> total_read_time_millis
- total_fetch_remote_time_millis -> total_read_remote_exec_time_millis
- number_of_successful_fetches -> successful_read_requests
- number_of_failed_fetches -> failed_read_requests
- operation_received -> operations_read
- total_transferred_bytes -> bytes_read
- total_index_time_millis -> total_write_time_millis [?]
- number_of_successful_bulk_operations -> successful_write_requests
- number_of_failed_bulk_operations -> failed_write_requests
- number_of_operations_indexed -> operations_written
- fetch_exception -> read_exceptions
- time_since_last_read_millis -> time_since_last_read_millis

* add test for max_write_request_(operation_count|size)
