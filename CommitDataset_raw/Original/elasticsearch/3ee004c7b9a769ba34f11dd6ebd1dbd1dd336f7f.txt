Add dedicated step for checking shrink allocation status (#35161)

This adds a new step for checking whether an index is allocated correctly based
on the rules added prior to running the shrink step. It also fixes a bug where
for shrink we are not allowed to have the shards relocating for the shrink step.

This also allows us to simplify AllocationRoutedStep and provide better
feedback in the step info for why either the allocation or the shrink checks
have failed.

Resolves #34938
