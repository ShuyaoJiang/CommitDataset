Adjust SHA-512 supported format on plugin install

This commit adjusts the format of the SHA-512 checksum files supported
by the plugin installer. In particular, we now require that the SHA-512
format be a single-line file containing the checksum followed by two
spaces followed by the filename. We continue to support the legacy
format for SHA-1.
