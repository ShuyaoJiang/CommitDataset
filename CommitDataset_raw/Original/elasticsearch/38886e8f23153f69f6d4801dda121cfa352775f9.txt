[DOCS] Add Kerberos troubleshooting documentation (#32803)

This commit adds troubleshooting section for Kerberos.
Most of the times the problems seen are caused due to invalid
configurations like keytab missing principals or credentials
not up to date. Time synchronization is an important part for
Kerberos infrastructure and the time skew can cause problems.
To debug further documentation explains how to enable JAAS
Kerberos login module debugging and Kerberos/SPNEGO debugging
by setting JVM system properties.
