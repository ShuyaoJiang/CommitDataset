Use config directory to find jvm.options

This commit removes the environment variable ES_JVM_OPTIONS that allows
the jvm.options file to sit separately from the rest of the config
directory. Instead, we use the CONF_DIR environment variable for custom
configuration location just as we do for the other configuration files.
