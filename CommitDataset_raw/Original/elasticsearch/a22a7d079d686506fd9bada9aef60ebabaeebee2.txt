ccr: Added maximum translog limit that a single shard changes response can return.

This limit is based on the number of estimate bytes in each translog
operation that fall between the minimum and maximum request sequence number.

If this limit is met then the shard follow task executor will make sure
that a subsequent shard changes request will be performed to fetch the
remaining translog operations.

This limit is needed in order to protect against returning too many
translog operations in a single shard changes response.

Relates to #2436
