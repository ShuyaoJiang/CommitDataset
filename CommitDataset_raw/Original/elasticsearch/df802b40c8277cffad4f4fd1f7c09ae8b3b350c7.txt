SQL: Rework SSL testing (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3126)

Drop the ssl tests against the java builtin https server. They were
failing and the failures were undebuggable. I still don't know what was
happening because you can't get any logging out of the server.

Add SSL tests against Elasticsearch because that is what actually needs
to work.
