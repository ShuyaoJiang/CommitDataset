Watcher: Replace flaky WatchStatsTests with unit tests (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2118)

This flaky tests was using sleep, latches and a custom script plugin,
causing issues with stopping/starting tests.

This removes the integration tests and replaces it with a unit test.

Also removed a couple of unused ctor/method parameters as cleanup.
