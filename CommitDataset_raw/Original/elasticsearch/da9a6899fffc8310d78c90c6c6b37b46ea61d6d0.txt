Painless: modify grammar to allow more statement delimiters (#29566)

This allows the grammar to determine when and what delimiters statements will use by
splitting up the statements into regular statements and delimited statements, those that do
not require a delimiter versus those that do. This allows consumers of the statements to
determine what delimiters the statements will use so that in certain cases semicolons are
not necessary like when there's a closing right bracket.

This change removes the need for semicolon insertion in the lexer, simplifying the existing
lexer quite a bit. It also ensures that there isn't a need to track semicolons being inserted
into places that aren't necessary such as array initializers.
