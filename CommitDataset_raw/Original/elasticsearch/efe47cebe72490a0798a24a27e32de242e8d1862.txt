Small refactorings to analysis components (#40745)

This change add the following internal refactorings:

* wraps input analyzers into an unmodifiable map in IndexAnalyzers ctor
* removes duplicated indexSetting in IndexAnalyzers
* removes references to IndexAnalyzers from DocumentMapperParser and TypeParser.ParserContext.
   It can always be retrieve it from MapperService directly in those cases
