Require translogUUID when reading global checkpoint (#28587)

Today we use the persisted global checkpoint to calculate the starting 
seqno in peer-recovery. However we do not check whether the translog 
actually belongs to the existing Lucene index when reading the global
checkpoint. In some rare cases if the translog does not match the Lucene
index, that recovering replica won't be able to complete its recovery.
This can happen as follows.

1. Replica executes a file-based recovery
2. Index files are copied to replica but crashed before finishing the recovery
3. Replica starts recovery again with seq-based as the copied commit is safe
4. Replica fails to open engine because translog and Lucene index are not matched
5. Replica won't be able to recover from primary

This commit enforces the translogUUID requirement when reading the 
global checkpoint directly from the checkpoint file.
