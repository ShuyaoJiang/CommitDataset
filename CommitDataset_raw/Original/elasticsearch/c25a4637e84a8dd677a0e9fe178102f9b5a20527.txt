Ensure total nanosecond time for tasks is at least 1 nanosecond

In rare cases the total nanoseconds for an entire window of operations can be 0
nanoseconds, causing the assertion in
QueueResizingEsThreadPoolExecutor.calculateLambda to trip. This ensures that we
calculate the lambda value with at least 1 nanosecond.

Resolves #27607
