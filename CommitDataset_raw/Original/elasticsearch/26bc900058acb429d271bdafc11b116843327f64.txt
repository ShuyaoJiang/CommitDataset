[DOCS] Rewrite low-level REST client docs and verify snippets compile (#25559)

Using the infra that we now have in place, we can convert the low-level REST client docs so that they extract code snippets from real Java classes. This way we make sure that all the snippets properly compile. Compared to the high level REST client docs, in this case we don't run the tests themselves, as that would require depending on test-framework which requires java 8 while the low-level REST client is compatible with java 7. I think that compiling snippets is enough for now.
