Move deprecated Rounding classes into test (#39064)

This moves the joda based rounding classes into the test directory, so
it does not get used accidentally. This allows us to keep the duel tests
running for now, which ensure that joda and java time implementations
produce the same results. This also removes the benchmarks class.
