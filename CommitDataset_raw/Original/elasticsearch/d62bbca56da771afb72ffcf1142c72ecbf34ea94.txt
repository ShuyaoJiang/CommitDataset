[Scripting] Use Number as a return value for BucketAggregationScript (#35653)

This change fixes #35351. Users were no longer able to return types of numbers other than doubles for bucket aggregation scripts. This change reverts to the previous behavior of being able to return any type of number and having it converted to a double outside of the script.
