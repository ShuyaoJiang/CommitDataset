Fix Fuzziness#asDistance(String) (#39643)

Currently Fuzziness#asDistance(String) doesn't work for custom AUTO values. If
the fuzziness is AUTO, the method returns the correct edit distance to use,
depending on the input string, but for custom AUTO values it currently always
returns an edit distance of 1. Correcting this and adding unit and integration
tests to catch these cases.
