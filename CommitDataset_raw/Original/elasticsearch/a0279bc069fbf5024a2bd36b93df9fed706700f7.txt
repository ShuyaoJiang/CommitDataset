Responses can use Writeable.Reader interface (#34655)

In order to remove Streamable from the codebase, Response objects need
to be read using the Writeable.Reader interface which this change
enables. This change enables the use of Writeable.Reader by adding the
`Action#getResponseReader` method. The default implementation simply
uses the existing `newResponse` method and the readFrom method. As
responses are migrated to the Writeable.Reader interface, Action
classes can be updated to throw an UnsupportedOperationException when
`newResponse` is called and override the `getResponseReader` method.
