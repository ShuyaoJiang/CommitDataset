Handle scheduler exceptions (#38014)

Scheduler.schedule(...) would previously assume that caller handles
exception by calling get() on the returned ScheduledFuture.
schedule() now returns a ScheduledCancellable that no longer gives
access to the exception. Instead, any exception thrown out of a
scheduled Runnable is logged as a warning.

This is a continuation of #28667, #36137 and also fixes #37708.
