SQL: Add remaining matrix aggregations (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3330)

* Add remaining matrix aggregations

This adds the remaining [matrix aggregations](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.1/search-aggregations-matrix-stats-aggregation.html).

These aggregations aren't currently implemented due to the inter-plugin
communication not being set up, so they return "innerkey/matrix stats not
handled (yet)".

For matrix aggs that share a name with an existing aggregation (like 'count'),
they have be prefixed with "matrix_", so, "matrix_count", "matrix_mean", and
"matrix_variance".

Relates to elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2885

* Return HTTP 400 for innerkey/matrix stats aggs

* Add integration test for unimplemented matrix aggs
