Use separate tasks per bwc artifact (#40703)

This commit changes the bwc builds from a single task for a branch to a
task for each bwc artifact. This reduces the bwc build time when only
needing a specific artifact, for example when running cluster restart
tests on a mac, the windows artifacts or rpm/debs are not needed.
