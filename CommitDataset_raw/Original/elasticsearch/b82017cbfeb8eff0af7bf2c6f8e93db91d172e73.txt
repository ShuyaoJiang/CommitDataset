Fix daitch_mokotoff phonetic filter to use the dedicated Lucene filter (#28225)

This commit changes the phonetic filter factory to use a DaitchMokotoffSoundexFilter
instead of a PhoneticFilter with a daitch_mokotoff encoder when daitch_mokotoff is selected.
The latter does not hanlde branching when computing the soundex and fails to encode multiple
variations when possible.

Closes #28211
