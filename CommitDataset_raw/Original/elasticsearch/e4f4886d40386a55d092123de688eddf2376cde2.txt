[Test] Extend parsing checks for DocWriteResponses (#25257)

This commit changes the parsing logic of DocWriteResponse, ReplicationResponse
and GetResult so that it skips any unknown additional fields (for forward compatibility 
reasons). This affects the IndexResponse, UpdateResponse,DeleteResponse and 
GetResponse objects.
