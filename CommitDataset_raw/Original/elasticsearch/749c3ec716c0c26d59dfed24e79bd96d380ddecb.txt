Remove the single argument Environment constructor (#27235)

Only tests should use the single argument Environment constructor.  To
enforce this the single arg Environment constructor has been replaced with
a test framework factory method.

Production code (beyond initial Bootstrap) should always use the same
Environment object that Node.getEnvironment() returns.  This Environment
is also available via dependency injection.
