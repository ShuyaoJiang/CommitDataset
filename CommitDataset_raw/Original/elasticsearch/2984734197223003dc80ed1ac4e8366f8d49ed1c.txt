Simplify number of shards setting (#30783)

This is code that was leftover from the move to one shard by
default. Here in index metadata we were preserving the default number of
shards settings independently of the area of code where we set this
value on an index that does not explicitly have an number of shards
setting. This took into consideration the es.index.max_number_of_shards
system property, and was used in search requests to set the default
maximum number of concurrent shard requests. We set the default there
based on the default number of shards so that in a one-node case a
search request could concurrently hit all shards on an index with the
defaults. Now that we default to one shard, we expect fewer shards in
clusters and this adjustment of the node count as the max number of
concurrent shard requests is no longer needed. This commit then changes
the default number of shards settings to be consistent with the value
used when an index is created, and removes the now unneeded adjustment
in search requests.
