[Painless] Add extensive tests for def to primitive casts (#36455)

This adds tests for each possible cast of def to a primitive type both implicit 
and explicit. This also fixes a minor bug where we were only checking the type 
of a def to be Number in some explicit casts. This does not work because it 
allows possible unintended casts from BigInteger and BigDecimal to primitive 
types since they both extend Number but are not included as part of the 
Painless casting model.
