Remove usages of CharSequence in Sets (#35501)

The javadocs of the CharSequence interface state that not all of its
implementations define the general contracts of the Object#equals and
Object#hashCode methods, therefore it is dangerous to use different CharSequence
instances as elements in a set or as keys in a map. While we probably mostly use
Strings in sets, in some places this is not enforced. To prevent this from
accidentally happening, this change replaces all occurances of Set<CharSequence>
which are currently mostly used in the completion suggester code with the more
concrete usage of Set<String>.
