Enhance error for out of bounds byte size settings (#29338)

Today when you input a byte size setting that is out of bounds for the
setting, you get an error message that indicates the maximum value of
the setting. The problem is that because we use ByteSize#toString, we
end up with a representation of the value that does not really tell you
what the bound is. For example, if the bound is 2^31 - 1 bytes, the
output would be 1.9gb which does not really tell you want the limit as
there are many byte size values that we format to the same 1.9gb with
ByteSize#toString. We have a method ByteSize#getStringRep that uses the
input units to the value as the output units for the string
representation, so we end up with no loss if we use this to report the
bound. This commit does this.
