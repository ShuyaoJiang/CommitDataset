Fail command-line client's auto-URL detection with helpful message (#40151)

The setup-passwords tool gives cryptic messages in case where custom discovery providers are
used (see #33580). As the URL auto-detection logic should be seen as best effort, this commit
improves the exception message to make it clearer what needs to be done to fix the issue.
