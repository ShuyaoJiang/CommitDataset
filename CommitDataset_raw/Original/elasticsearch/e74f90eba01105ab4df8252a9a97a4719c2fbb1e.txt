[Monitoring] Add Cluster Alert for Nodes Changed (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3504)

This creates a cluster alert that triggers whenever a node is:

- Added
- Removed
- Restarted (aka Removed and Added between collections)

Unlike all previous cluster alerts, this cluster is always instantly resolved because there is no way to otherwise resolve it later (especially if nodes are replaced).

This will require a small change to the UI so that it does not simply ignore resolved alerts.
