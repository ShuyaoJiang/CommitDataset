Choose JVM options ergonomically

With this commit we add the possibility to define further JVM options (and
system properties) based on the current environment. As a proof of concept, it
chooses Netty's allocator ergonomically based on the maximum defined heap size.
We switch to the unpooled allocator at 1GB heap size (value determined
experimentally, see #30684 for more details). We are also explicit about the
choice of the allocator in either case.
