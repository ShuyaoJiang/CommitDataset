Monitoring: Ensure all monitoring watches filter by timestamp (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3238)

Only the Logstash and Kibana version mismatch watches contain a time
filter, the others are only sorting by timestamp. In combination with
searching in all `.monitoring-es-*` indices, this is IMO pretty resource
intensive, as we cannot exit early on any search request.

This commit adds time based filters to remaining three watches, using
the same range than the other two.
