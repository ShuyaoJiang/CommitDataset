Merge FunctionScoreQuery and FiltersFunctionScoreQuery (#25889)

This change merges the functionality of the FiltersFunctionScoreQuery in the FunctionScoreQuery.
It also ensures that an exception is thrown when the computed score is equals to Float.NaN or Float.NEGATIVE_INFINITY.
These scores are invalid for TopDocsCollectors that relies on score comparison.
