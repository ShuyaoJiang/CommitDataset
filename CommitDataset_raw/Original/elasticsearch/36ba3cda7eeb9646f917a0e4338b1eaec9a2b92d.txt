Enable global checkpoint listeners to timeout (#33620)

In cross-cluster replication, we will use global checkpoint listeners to
long poll for updates to a shard. However, we do not want these polls to
wait indefinitely as it could be difficult to discern if the listener is
still waiting for updates versus something has gone horribly wrong and
cross-cluster replication is stuck. Instead, we want these listeners to
timeout after some period (for example, one minute) so that they are
notified and we can update status on the following side that
cross-cluster replication is still active. After this, we will
immediately enter back into a poll mode.

To do this, we need the ability to associate a timeout with a global
checkpoint listener. This commit adds this capability.
