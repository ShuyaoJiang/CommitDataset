Bubble up exception when processing NoOp (#39338)

Today we do not bubble up exceptions when processing NoOps but always
treat them as document-level failures. This incorrect treatment causes
the assert_no_failure being tripped in peer-recovery if IndexWriter was
closed exceptionally before.

Closes #38898
