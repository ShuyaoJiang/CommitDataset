 Reduce composite references at network level (#36400)

Creating `CompositeBytesReference` has more overhead than a single
`ByteBufferReference`. Many of our messages will be contained to a
single `ByteBuffer`. This commit avoids creating composite instances
when there is 0 or 1  underlying `ByteBuffers`.
