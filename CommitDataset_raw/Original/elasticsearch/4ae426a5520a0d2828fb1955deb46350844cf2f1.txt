Remove remaining `index.mapping.single_type=false` (#25369)

This change cleans up remaining tests  to not use index.mapping.single_type=false
but instead where applicable use a single type or markt the index as created
with a pre 6.x version.

Yet, there is still on leftover in the client tests that needs special attention.
See `org.elasticsearch.client.SearchIT`
