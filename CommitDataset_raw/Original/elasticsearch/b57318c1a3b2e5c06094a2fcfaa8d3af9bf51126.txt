Execute watcher lifecycle changes in order (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4437)

This change updates the WatcherLifecycleService to have its own single
thread executor that is used for lifecycle changes in order to have a
guarantee for the order that the changes are executed in.

Previously, a runnable would be submitted to the generic threadpool for
each lifecycle change that is needed. There was no guarantee of
ordering for these changes and no checks to see if a state change was
already in flight.
