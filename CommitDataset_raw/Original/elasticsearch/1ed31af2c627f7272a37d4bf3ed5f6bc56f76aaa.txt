[ML] Allow model_memory_limit to be reduced (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3998)

Up to now a job update that reduces the model memory limit
was not allowed. However, there could definitely be cases
where reducing the limit is necessary and reasonable.

This commit makes it possible to decrease the limit as long
as it does not go below the current memory usage. We obtain
the latter from the model size stats.

The conditions under which updating the model_memory_limit
is not allowed are now:

 - when the job is open
 - latest model_size_stats.model_bytes < new value

relates elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2461
