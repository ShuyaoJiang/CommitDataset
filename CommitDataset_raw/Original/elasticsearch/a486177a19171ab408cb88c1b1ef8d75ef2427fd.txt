[Rollup] Metric config parser must use builder so validation runs (#31159)

The parser for the Metric config was directly instantiating
the config object, rather than using the builder.  That means it was
bypassing the validation logic built into the builder, and would allow
users to create invalid metric configs (like using unsupported metrics).

The job would later blow up and abort due to bad configs, but this isn't
immediately obvious to the user since the PutJob API succeeded.
