Allow Uid#decodeId to decode from a byte array slice (#26987)

Today we only allow to decode byte arrays where the data has a 0 offset
and the same length as the array. Allowing to decode stuff from a slice will
make decoding IDs cheaper if the the ID is for instance coming from a term dictionary
or BytesRef.
