Initialize startup `CcrRepositories` (#36730)

Currently, the CcrRepositoryManger only listens for settings updates
and installs new repositories. It does not install the repositories that
are in the initial settings. This commit, modifies the manager to
install the initial repositories. Additionally, it modifies the ccr
integration test to configure the remote leader node at startup, instead
of using a settings update.
