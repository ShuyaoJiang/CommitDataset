Upgrade remote cluster settings (#33537)

This commit adds settings upgraders for the search.remote.* settings
that can be in the cluster state to automatically upgrade these settings
to cluster.remote.*. Because of the infrastructure that we have here,
these settings can be upgraded when recovering the cluster state, but
also when a user tries to make a dynamic update for these settings.
