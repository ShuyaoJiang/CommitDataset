[ML] Disable security audit trail in native integ tests suite (#39683)

Investigating how to make DeleteExpiredDataIT faster, it was
revealed that the security audit trail threads were quite hot.
Disabling that seems to be helping quite a bit with making this
test faster. This commit also unmutes the test to see how it goes
with the audit trail disabled.

Relates #39658
Closes #39575
