Remove immediate operation retry after mapping update (#38873)

Prior to this commit, when an indexing operation resulted in an
`Engine.Result.Type.MAPPING_UPDATE_REQUIRED`, TransportShardBulkAction
immediately retries the indexing operation to see if it succeeds. In the event
that it succeeds the context does not wait until the mapping update has
propagated through the cluster state before finishing the indexing.

In some of our tests we rely on mappings being available as soon as they've been
introduced in a document that indexed correctly. By removing the immediate retry
we always wait for this to be the case.
