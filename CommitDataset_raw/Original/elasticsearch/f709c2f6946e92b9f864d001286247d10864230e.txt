[ML] Add a timeout option to file structure finder (#34117)

This can be used to restrict the amount of CPU a single
structure finder request can use.

The timeout is not implemented precisely, so requests
may run for slightly longer than the timeout before
aborting.

The default is 25 seconds, which is a little below
Kibana's default timeout of 30 seconds for calls to
Elasticsearch APIs.
