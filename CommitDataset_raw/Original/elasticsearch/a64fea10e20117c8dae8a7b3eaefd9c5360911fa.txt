Enable IPv6 URIs in reindex from remote (#36874)

Reindex from remote was using a custom regex to dermine what URIs were
valid. This commit removes the custom regex and uses the java.net.URI
class instead, allowing IPv6 support without changing the existing
validation around a URI in reindex from remote.
