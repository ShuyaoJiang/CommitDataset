[Zen2] Add HandshakingTransportAddressConnector (#32643)

The `PeerFinder`, introduced in #32246, needs to be able to identify, and
connect to, a remote master node using only its `TransportAddress`. This can be
done by opening a single-channel connection to the address, performing a
handshake, and only then forming a full-blown connection to the node. This
change implements this logic.
