Enable not wiping cluster settings after REST test (#33575)

In some cases we want to skip wiping cluster settings after a REST
test. For example, one use-case would be in the full cluster restart
tests where want to test cluster settings before and after a full
cluster restart. If we wipe the cluster settings before the restart,
then it would not be possible to assert on them after the restart.
