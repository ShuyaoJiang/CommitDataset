[TEST] Fix ML licensing tests following change in core test framework (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2152)

The change made in elastic/elasticsearch#25986 means that half the time
tests will use the NIO transport rather than the mock TCP transport.
But the NIO plugin was not added to the TestXPackTransportClient.
