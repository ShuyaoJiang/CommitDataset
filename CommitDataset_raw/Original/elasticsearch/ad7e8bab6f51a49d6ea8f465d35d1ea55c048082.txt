Revive build Javadocs on JDK 10 and workaround bug (#29173)

This commit reenables the Javadoc tasks on JDK 10. To reenable these
tasks, we have to workaround a bug in JDK 10 which trips on some deeply
nested anonymous classes that we have in the codebase (and are fine
as-is, this is not a problem with this code). The workaround is to
remove the compiled classes from the classpath. This has been reported
upstream and the workaround was suggested there (see the code comment).
