[Security] [certgen] Option to generate PKCSelastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#12  (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2013)

Add an option to the ssl certificate generation tool (certgen) that generates PKCSelastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#12 (.p12) files in addition to the certificate (.crt) and key (.key) files.
A PKCSelastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#12 store is a container format for storing multiple crypto objects in a single file, which means we can put the cert and key into the same file.

These format is particularly useful for .NET environments, where .NET Core requires a single into file for PKI authentication.

Also adds documentation for all the command-line options in certgen.
