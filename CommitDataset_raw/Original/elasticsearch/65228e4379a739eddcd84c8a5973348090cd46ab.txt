X-Pack: Add index.internal.format index setting (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1700)

This introduces a new index setting called xpack.internal.format to
x-pack, which is configured for all of our index templates and set to
"v6". This indicates the version of compatibility of this index.

In addition a setting named index.xpack.version has been removed,
as it was unused.

Watcher does not start, if the watches and the triggered watches
index is not compatible with this setting.
