Make custom index metadata completely immutable (#33735)

Currently `IndexMetadata#getCustomData(...)` wraps the custom metadata
in an unmodifiable map, but in case there is no entry for the specified
key then a NPE is thrown by Collections.unmodifiableMap(...). This is not
ideal in case callers like to throw an exception with a specific message.
(like in the case for ccr to indicate that the follow index was not created
by the create_and_follow api and therefor incompatible as follow index)

I think making `DiffableStringMap` itself immutable is better then just wrapping
custom metadata with `Collections.unmodifiableMap(...)` in all methods that access it.

Also removed the `equals()`, `hashcode()` and to `toString()` methods of
`DiffableStringMap`, because `AbstractMap` already implements these methods.
