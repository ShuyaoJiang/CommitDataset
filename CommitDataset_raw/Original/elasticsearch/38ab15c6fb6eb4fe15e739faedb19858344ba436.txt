Avoid shutting down the only master (#36272)

Today the InternalTestClusterTests sometimes set up a cluster with a single
master, start some other ndoes, shut the original master down, and then reset
the cluster. This doesn't really work, because the original master may be
stale. This change avoids shutting down the only master in this situation.
