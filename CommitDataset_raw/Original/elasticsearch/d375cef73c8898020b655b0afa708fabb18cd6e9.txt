Upgrade AWS SDK Jackson Databind to 2.6.7.1

The AWS SDK has a transitive dependency on Jackson Databind. While the
AWS SDK was recently upgraded, the Jackson Databind dependency was not
pulled along with it to the version that the AWS SDK depends on. This
commit upgrades the dependencies for discovery-ec2 and repository-s3
plugins to match versions on the AWS SDK transitive dependencies.
