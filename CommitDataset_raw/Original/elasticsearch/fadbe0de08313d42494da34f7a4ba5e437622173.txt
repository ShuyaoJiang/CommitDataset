Automatically prepare indices for splitting (#27451)

Today we require users to prepare their indices for split operations.
Yet, we can do this automatically when an index is created which would
make the split feature a much more appealing option since it doesn't have
any 3rd party prerequisites anymore.

This change automatically sets the number of routinng shards such that
an index is guaranteed to be able to split once into twice as many shards.
The number of routing shards is scaled towards the default shard limit per index
such that indices with a smaller amount of shards can be split more often than
larger ones. For instance an index with 1 or 2 shards can be split 10x
(until it approaches 1024 shards) while an index created with 128 shards can only
be split 3x by a factor of 2. Please note this is just a default value and users
can still prepare their indices with `index.number_of_routing_shards` for custom
splitting.

NOTE: this change has an impact on the document distribution since we are changing
the hash space. Documents are still uniformly distributed across all shards but since
we are artificually changing the number of buckets in the consistent hashign space
document might be hashed into different shards compared to previous versions.

This is a 7.0 only change.
