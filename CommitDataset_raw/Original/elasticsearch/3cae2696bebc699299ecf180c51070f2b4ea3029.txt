Remove TLSv1.2 pinning in ssl reload tests (#38651)

This change removes the pinning of TLSv1.2 in the
SSLConfigurationReloaderTests that had been added to workaround an
issue with the MockWebServer and Apache HttpClient when using TLSv1.3.
The way HttpClient closes the socket causes issues with the TLSv1.3
SSLEngine implementation that causes the MockWebServer to loop
endlessly trying to send the close message back to the client. This
change wraps the created http connection in a way that allows us to
override the closing behavior of HttpClient.

An upstream request with HttpClient has been opened at
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HTTPCORE-571 to see if the method
of closing can be special cased for SSLSocket instances.

This is caused by a JDK bug, JDK-8214418 which is fixed by
https://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk/jdk12/rev/5022a4915fe9.
