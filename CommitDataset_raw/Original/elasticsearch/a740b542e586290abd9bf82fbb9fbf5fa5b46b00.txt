Cleanup .gitignore (#30145)

Adds the `.vscode` directory to `.gitignore`. This didn't come up when
we had x-pack in a different repository than Elasticsearch because I'd
open the directory that contained both of them in VSCode. Now that they
are merged I tend to just open the Elasticsearch repository which causes
VSCode to create this directory that we don't need to commit.

Also removes leftover maven files from `.gitignore`.
