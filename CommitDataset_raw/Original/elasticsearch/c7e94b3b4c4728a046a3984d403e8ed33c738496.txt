[ML] Enable overall buckets aggregation at a custom bucket span (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2782)

For the purpose of getting this API consumed by our UI, returning
overall buckets that match the job's largest `bucket_span` can
result in too much data. The UI only ever displays a few buckets
in the swimlane. Their span depends on the time range selected and
the screen resolution, but it will only ever be a relatively
low number.

This PR adds the ability to aggregate overall buckets in a user
specified `bucket_span`. That `bucket_span` may be equal or
greater to the largest job's `bucket_span`. The `overall_score`
of the result overall buckets is the max score of the
corresponding overall buckets with a span equal to the job's
largest `bucket_span`.

The implementation is now chunking the bucket requests
as otherwise the aggregation would fail when too many buckets
are matching.
