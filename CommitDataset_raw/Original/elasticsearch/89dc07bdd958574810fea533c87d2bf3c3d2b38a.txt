ingest: better support for conditionals with simulate?verbose (#34155)

This commit introduces two corrections to the way simulate?verbose
handles conditionals on processors.

1) Prior to this change when executing simulate?verbose for
processors with conditionals that evaluate to false, that processor
would still be displayed in the result set. What was displayed was
correct, such that no changes to the document occurred. However, if the
conditional evaluates to false, the processor should not even be
displayed.

2) Prior to this change when executing simulate?verbose for
pipeline processors with conditionals, the individual steps would no
longer be displayed. Commit e37e5df addressed the issue, but
failed account for a conditional on the pipeline processor. Since
a pipeline processor can introduce cycles and is effectively a
single processor that encapsulates multiple other processors that
are potentially guarded by a single conditional, special handling is
needed to for pipeline and conditional pipeline processors.
