Watcher: Properly find next valid date in cron expressions (#32734)

When a list/an array of cron expressions is provided, and one of those addresses
is already expired, the expired one will be considered as an option
instead of the valid next one.

This commit also reduces the visibility of the CronnableSchedule and
refactors a comparator to look like java 8.
