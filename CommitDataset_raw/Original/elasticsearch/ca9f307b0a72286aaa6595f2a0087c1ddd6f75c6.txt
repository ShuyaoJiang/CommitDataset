add move-to-step endpoint for lifecycles (#30636)


This change introduces a new rest endpoint for lifecycles that
allows users to explicitely jump to earlier or later steps in the
policy's execution. This is useful for re-running tasks that may
be stuck, or were incorrectly configured.

Endpoint can be found in this format:

POST _xpack/index_lifecycle/_move/<index_name>
{
  current_step: ...
  next_step: ...
}

This operates on a per-index basis and does not resolve the param to
multiple indices.

The action is validated so that the index's state is only modified if
all of the following are true:

- <index_name> has an existing policy associated with it
- current_step is the actual step the index is currently on (for sanity)
- next_step is a valid step within the policy-step-registry

* respond to reviewer

refactor to stop using MoveToNextStepUpdateTask directly

* remove getPolicyRegistry

* rename validateMoveToNextStep
