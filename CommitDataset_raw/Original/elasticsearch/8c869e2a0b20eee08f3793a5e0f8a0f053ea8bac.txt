More advices around search speed and disk usage. (#25252)

It adds notes about:
 - how preference can help optimize cache usage
 - the fact that too many replicas can hurt search performance due to lower
   utilization of the filesystem cache
 - how index sorting can improve _source compression
 - how always putting fields in the same order in documents can improve _source
   compression
