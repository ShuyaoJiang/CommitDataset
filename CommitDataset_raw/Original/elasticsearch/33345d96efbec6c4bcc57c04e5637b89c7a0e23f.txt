Delete flaky SettingsBasedHostProviderIT test (#34813)

testClusterFormsByScanningPorts is flaky: sometimes in CI it's not possible to
bind to any of the ports we need to in order for the port scanning to work.
This change removes this test, and #34809 describes a better way to test this
behaviour.
