Fix date index name processor default date_formats (#40915)

This commit is a correction of a doc bug in the docs for the ingest
date-index-name processor. The correct pattern is
yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSXX. This is due to the transition from Joda
time to Java time where Z does not mean the same thing between the two.
