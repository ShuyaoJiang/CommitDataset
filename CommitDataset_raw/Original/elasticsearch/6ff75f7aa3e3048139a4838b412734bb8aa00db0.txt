Build: use built-in support for keystore files (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4353)

This commit switches the manual creation and addition of files to the
keystore to use the built-in support available in the integTestCluster
configuration closure.

This change removes the need to worry about the creation of the
keystore and possibly dealing with a prompt from the creation command.
