Simplify MultiSnapshot#SeqNoset (#27547)

Today, we maintain two sets in a SeqNoSet: ongoing sets and completed
sets. We can remove the completed sets and use only the ongoing sets by
releasing the internal bitset of a CountedBitSet when all its bits are
set. This behaves like two sets but simpler. This commit also makes
CountedBitSet as a drop-in replacement for BitSet.
