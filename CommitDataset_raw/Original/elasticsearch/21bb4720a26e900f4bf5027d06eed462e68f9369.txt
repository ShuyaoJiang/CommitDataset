add notion of version and modified_date to LifecyclePolicyMetadata (#33450)

It is useful to keep track of which version of a policy is currently
being executed by a specific index. For management purposes, it would
also be useful to know at which time the latest version was inserted
so that an audit trail is left for reconciling changes happening in ILM.
