DOCS Auditing search queries (#35301)

This documents how to include the search queries in the audit log.

There is a catch, that even if enabling `emit_request_body`, which should
output queries included in request bodies, search queries were not output
because, implicitly, no REST layer audit event type was included.

This folk knowledge is herein imprinted.
