[ML] Rate limit established model memory updates (#31768)

There is at most one model size stats document per bucket, but
during lookback a job can churn through many buckets very quickly.
This can lead to many cluster state updates if established model
memory needs to be updated for a given model size stats document.

This change rate limits established model memory updates to one
per job per 5 seconds.  This is done by scheduling the updates 5
seconds in the future, but replacing the value to be written if
another model size stats document is received during the waiting
period.  Updating the values in arrears like this means that the
last value received will be the one associated with the job in the
long term, whereas alternative approaches such as not updating the
value if a new value was close to the old value would not.
