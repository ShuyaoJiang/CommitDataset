Watcher: Ensure no template deletion race in mixed cluster environment (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1964)

When having a mixed cluster with 5.6 and 6.0 nodes, the template upgrade
service has a cluster state listener that deletes the old watches and
triggered_watches index template. However during that time the 5.6 node
WatcherIndexTemplateRegistry checks if the templates are missing and
adds them back. This results in a race, because the new .watches index
template does not get added by the WatcherIndexTemplateRegistry when the
6.0 node is node a master node.

This commit circumvents this issue, by only deleting the watches and
triggered watches template during the upgrade process.
