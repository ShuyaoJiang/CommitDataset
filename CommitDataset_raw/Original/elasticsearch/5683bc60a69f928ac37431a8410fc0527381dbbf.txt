Multiplexing token filter (#31208)

The `multiplexer` filter emits multiple tokens at the same position, each 
version of the token haivng been passed through a different filter chain.
Identical tokens at the same position are removed.

This allows users to, for example, index lowercase and original-case tokens,
or stemmed and unstemmed versions, in the same field, so that they can search
for a stemmed term within x positions of an unstemmed term.
