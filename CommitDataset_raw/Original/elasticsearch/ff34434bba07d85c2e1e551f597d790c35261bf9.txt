Build: Extract all ES versions into gradle properties (#24748)

This commit expands the logic for version extraction from Version.java
to include a list of all versions for backcompat purposes. The tests
using bwcVersion are converted to use this list, but those tests
(rolling upgrade and backwards-5.0) are still not randomized; that will
happen in another followup.
