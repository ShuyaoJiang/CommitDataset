Fix building Javadoc JARs on JDK for client JARs (#29274)

When a module or plugin register that it has a client JAR, we copy
artifacts like the Javadoc and sources JARs as the JARs for the client
as well (with -client added to the name). I previously had to disable
the Javadoc task on JDK 10 due to a bug in bin/javadoc. After JDK 10
went GA without a fix for this bug, I added workaround to fix the
Javadoc task on JDK 10. However, I made a mistake reverting the
previously skipped Javadocs tasks and missed that one that copies the
Javadoc JAR for client JARs. This commit fixes that issue.
