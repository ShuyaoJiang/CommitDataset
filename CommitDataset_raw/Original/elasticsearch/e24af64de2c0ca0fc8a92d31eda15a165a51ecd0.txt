Add strict parsing of aggregation ranges (#25769)

Currently we ignore unknown field names when parsing RangeAggregator.Range and
GeoDistanceAggregationBuilder.Range from `range`, `date_range` or `geo_distance`
aggregations. This can hide subtle errors in the query. This change makes parsing `ranges`
stricter.
