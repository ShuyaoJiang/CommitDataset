Reset replica engine to global checkpoint on promotion (#33473)

When a replica starts following a newly promoted primary, it may have
some operations which don't exist on the new primary. Thus we need to
throw those operations to align a replica with the new primary. This can
be done by first resetting an engine from the safe commit, then replaying
the local translog up to the global checkpoint.
