Fix license messaging for Logstash functionality (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3268)

* Fix license messaging for Logstash functionality

With a Basic license, users are still able to perform CRUD operations on the `.logstash` index, therefore manage their Logstash pipelines. However, Logstash itself will not pick up any changes from this index and act on them. With an expired license Logstash functionality continues to operate as normal.

* Fixing messages after feedback

* Removing extraneous tabs at end of line

* Fixing typo
