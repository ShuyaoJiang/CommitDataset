* Made ChunkCoordinator unittest testable
* Fixed a small issue where each batch would fetch / index the previous batch last operation
* Made batch size a request param on the follow existing index api request.
  This makes is easy to tune this param when running tests from scripts.
* Changed default batch size from 256 to 1024.
