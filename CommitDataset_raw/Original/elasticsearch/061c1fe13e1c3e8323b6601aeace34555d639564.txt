Ensure random timestamps are within search boundary (#38753)

The random timestamps were landing too close to the current time,
so an unlucky rollup interval would round such that the doc wasn't
included in the search range (and thus not "rolled up") which
would then fail the test.

The fix is to make sure the timestamp of all docs is sufficiently behind
'now' that the possible rounding intervals will always include them.

Unmutes testRandomizedDateHisto, closes #34762
