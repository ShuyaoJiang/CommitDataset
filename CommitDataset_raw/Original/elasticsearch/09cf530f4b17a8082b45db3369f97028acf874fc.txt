Derive max composite buffers from max content len

With this commit we determine the maximum number of buffers that Netty keeps
while accumulating one HTTP request based on the maximum content length (default
1500 bytes, overridable with the system property `es.net.mtu`). Previously, we
kept the default value of 1024 which is too small for bulk requests which leads
to unnecessary copies of byte buffers internally.
