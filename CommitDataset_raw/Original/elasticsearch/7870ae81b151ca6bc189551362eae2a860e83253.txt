[ML] Prevent stack overflow while copying ML jobs and datafeeds (#36370)

ML jobs and datafeeds wrap collections into their unmodifiable
equivalents in their constructor. However, the copying builder
does not make a copy of some of those collections resulting
in wrapping those again and again. This can eventually result
to stack overflow.

This commit addressed this issue by copying the collections in
question in the copying builder constructor.

Closes #36360
