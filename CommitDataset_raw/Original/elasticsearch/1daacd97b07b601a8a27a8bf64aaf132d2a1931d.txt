Scripting: Add instance and compiled classes to script contexts (#24868)

This commit modifies the compile method of ScriptService to be context
aware. The ScriptContext is now a generic class which contains both the
instance type and compiled type for a script. Instance type may be
stateful (for example, pre loading field information for the index a
script will execute on, like in expressions), while the compiled type is
stateless and used to construct instance type instances. This change is
only a first step to cutover ScriptService to the new paradigm. It only
converts callers to the script service, and has a small shim to wrap
compilation from the script engines to support the current two fixed
instance types, SearchScript and ExecutableScript.
