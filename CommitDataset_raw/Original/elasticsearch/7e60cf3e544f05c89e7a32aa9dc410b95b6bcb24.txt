Move parent_id query to the parent-join module (#25072)

This change moves the parent_id query to the parent-join module and handles the case when only the parent-join field can be declared on an index (index with single type on).
If single type is off it uses the legacy parent join field mapper and switch to the new one otherwise (default in 6).
