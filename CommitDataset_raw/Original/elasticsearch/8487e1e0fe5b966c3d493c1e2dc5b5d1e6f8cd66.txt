[ML] Better handling of errors if native controller dies (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2141)

If the native controller dies or is killed then requests to open jobs
now immediately return with an error that says what the problem is.
The error that is logged also now clearly records the problem.

Previously open job requests would time out if the native controller
was not running, and logged errors were not easy to understand without
in-depth knowledge of the ML code.
