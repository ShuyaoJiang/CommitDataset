Add test for index with two types (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2194)

Adds a test that shows *how* SQL fails to address an index with two types
to the full cluster restart tests. Because we're writing this code
against 7.0 don't actually execute the test, but we will execute it when
we merge to 6.x and it *should* work.
