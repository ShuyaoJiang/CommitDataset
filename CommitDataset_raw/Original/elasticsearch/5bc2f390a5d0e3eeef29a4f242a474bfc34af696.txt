Use CountedBitSet in LocalCheckpointTracker (#27793)

The CountedBitSet can automatically release its internal bitsets when
all bits are set to reduce memory usage. This structure can work well
for sequence numbers as these numbers are likely to form contiguous
ranges. This commit replaces FixedBitSet by CountedBitSet in
LocalCheckpointTracker.
