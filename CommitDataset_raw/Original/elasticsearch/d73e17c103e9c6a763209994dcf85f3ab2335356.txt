SpanNearQueryBuilder should return the inner clause when a single clause is provided (#25856)

This change handles the case where a SpanNearQueryBuilder tries to create a query with a single clause.
This is not allowed in the SpanNearQuery so instead of throwing an exception when the weight is built, this change builds and returns
the singleton inner clause on toQuery.

Fixes #25630
