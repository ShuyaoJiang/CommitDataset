SQL: Fix test when random JDK TZ doesn't exist in Joda (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2903)

JodaTime timezone db can be out of date compared to that of the JDK which causes the JDBC Connection to fail when the randomized tests pick a timezone that's available in the JDK but not in Joda, like SystemV/PST8. This is happening because JdbcConnection configuration is using system default timezone and tries to pass it to Elasticsearch that is using joda. This commit, explicitly sets the time zone on JdbcConnection to a time zone randomly selected from a list of timezones that are known to both JDK and Joda.
