Add the ability to the follow index to follow an index in a remote cluster.

The follow index api completely reuses CCS infrastructure that was exposed via:
https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/29495

This means that the leader index parameter support the same ccs index
to indicate that an index resides in a different cluster.

I also added a qa module that smoke tests the cross cluster nature of ccr.
The idea is that this test just verifies that ccr can read data from a
remote leader index and that is it, no crazy randomization or indirectly
testing other features.
