Ensure realtime `_get` and `_termvectors` don't run on the network thread (#33814)

The change in #27500 introduces this regression that causes `_get` and `_term_vector`
actions to run on the network thread if the realtime flag is set.
This fixes the issue by delegating to the super method forking on the corresponding threadpool.
