Setup: Change default heap to 1G (#25695)

This commit changes the default heap size to 1 GB. Experimenting with
elasticsearch is often done on laptops, and 1 GB is much friendlier to
laptop memory. It does put more pressure on the gc, but the tradeoff is
a smaller default footprint. Users running in production can (and
should) adjust the heap size as necessary for their usecase.
