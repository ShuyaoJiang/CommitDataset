Limit num hits when reading Lucene changes (#30908)

Today we don't limit the number of hits when reading changes from Lucene
index. If the index and the requesting seq# range both are large, the
searcher may consume a huge amount of memory.

This commit uses a fixed size batch with search_after to avoid the
problem.
