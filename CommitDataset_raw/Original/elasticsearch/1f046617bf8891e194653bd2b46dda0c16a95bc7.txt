TESTS: Fix Race Condition in Temp Path Creation (#33352)

* TESTS: Fix Race Condition in Temp Path Creation

* Calling `createTempDir` concurrently here in
the `Follower`s causes collisions at times
which lead to `createEngine` throwing because
of unexpected files in the newly created temp
dir
   * Fixed by creating all temp dirs in the main test thread
* closes #33344
