Allow ILM to stop if indices have nonexistent policies (#40820)

Prior to this PR, there is a bug in ILM which does not allow ILM to stop
if one or more indices have an index.lifecycle.name which refers to
a policy that does not exist - the operation_mode will be stuck as
STOPPING until either the policy is created or the nonexistent
policy is removed from those indices.

This change allows ILM to stop in this case and makes the logging more
clear as to why ILM is not stopping.
