Allow User/Password realms to disable authc (#34033)

The "lookupUser" method on a realm facilitates the "run-as" and
"authorization_realms" features.
This commit allows a realm to be used for "lookup only", in which
case the "authenticate" method (and associated token methods) are
disabled.
It does this through the introduction of a new
"authentication.enabled" setting, which defaults to true.
