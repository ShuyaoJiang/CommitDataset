Update Painless to Allow Augmentation from Any Class (#25360)

Custom whitelists in Painless will need to allow classes to be augmented beyond the currently hard-coded Augmentation class tied to Painless directly. This change allows any class to specify an augmentation on a Painless struct using an appropriate static method. Changes to loading the whitelist have also been created to allow for this specification of a different class for augmentation.
