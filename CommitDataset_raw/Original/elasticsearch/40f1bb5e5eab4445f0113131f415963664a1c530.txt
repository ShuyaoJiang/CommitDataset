Trim translog when safe commit advanced (#32967)

Since #28140 when the global checkpoint is advanced, we try to move the
safe commit forward, and clean up old index commits if possible. However,
we forget to trim unreferenced translog.

This change makes sure that we prune both old translog and index commits
when the safe commit advanced.

Relates #28140
Closes #32089
