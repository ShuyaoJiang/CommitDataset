Move sql-proto and jdbc to java.util.TimeZone (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4350)

* Move sql-proto and jdbc to java.util.TimeZone

This moves sql-proto and jdbc from Joda's `DateTimeZone` to
`java.util.TimeZone`, this will allow us in the future to be able to decouple
JDBC from Joda.

This does not decouple all of SQL from joda, it focuses on as small a piece as I
could for sql-proto and jdbc.

Requires https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/29487 to be merged first.
