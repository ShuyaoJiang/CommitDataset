Allow plugins to build pre-configured token filters (#24223)

This changes the way we register pre-configured token filters so that
plugins can declare them and starts to move all of the pre-configured
token filters out of core. It doesn't finish the job because doing
so would make the change unreviewably large. So this PR includes
a shim that keeps the "old" way of registering pre-configured token
filters around.

The Lowercase token filter is special because there is a "special"
interaction between it and the lowercase tokenizer. I'm not sure
exactly what to do about it so for now I'm leaving it alone with
the intent of figuring out what to do with it in a followup.

This also renames these pre-configured token filters from
"pre-built" to "pre-configured" because that seemed like a more
descriptive name.
