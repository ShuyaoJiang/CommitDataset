Obey translog durability in global checkpoint sync

After write operations in some situations we fire a post-operation
global checkpoint sync. The global checkpoint sync unconditionally
fsyncs the translog and this can then look like an fsync
per-request. This violates the translog durability settings on the index
if this durability is set to async. This commit changes the global
checkpoint sync to observe the translog durability.
