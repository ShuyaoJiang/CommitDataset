[CCR] Validate index privileges prior to following an index (#33758)

Prior to following an index in the follow API, check whether current
user has sufficient privileges in the leader cluster to read and
monitor the leader index.

Also check this in the create and follow API prior to creating the
follow index.

Also introduced READ_CCR cluster privilege that include the minimal
cluster level actions that are required for ccr in the leader cluster.
So a user can follow indices in a cluster, but not use the ccr admin APIs.

Closes #33553
