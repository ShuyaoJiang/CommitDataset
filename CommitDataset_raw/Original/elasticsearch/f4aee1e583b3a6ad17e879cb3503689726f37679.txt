Disallow multiple parent-join fields per mapping (#25002)

This change ensures that there is a single parent-join field defined per mapping.
The verification is done through the addition of a special field mapper (MetaJoinFieldMapper) with a unique name (_parent_join) that is registered to the mapping service
when the first parent-join field is defined. If a new parent-join is added, this field mapper will clash with the new one and the update will fail.
This change also simplifies the parent join fetch sub phase by retrieving the parent-join field without iterating on all fields in the mapping.
