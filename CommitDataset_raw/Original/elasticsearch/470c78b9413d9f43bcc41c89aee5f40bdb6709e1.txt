Synchronize pendingOutgoingJoins (#39900)

Today we use a ConcurrentHashSet to track the in-flight outgoing joins in the
`JoinHelper`. This is fine for adding and removing elements but not for the
emptiness test in `isJoinPending()` which might return false if one join
finishes just after another one starts, even though joins were pending
throughout.

As used today this is ok: it means the node was trying to join a master but
this join attempt just finished unsuccessfully, and causes it to (rightfully)
reject a `FollowerCheck` from the failed master. However this kind of API
inconsistency is trappy and there is no need to be clever here, so this change
replaces the set with a `synchronizedSet()`.
