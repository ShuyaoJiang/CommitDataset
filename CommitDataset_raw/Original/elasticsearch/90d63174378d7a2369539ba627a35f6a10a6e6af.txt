Remove checkpoint tracker bit sets setting

We added an index-level setting for controlling the size of the bit sets
used to back the local checkpoint tracker. This setting is really only
needed to control the memory footprint of the bit sets but we do not
think this setting is going to be needed. This commit removes this
setting before it is released to the wild after which we would have to
worry about BWC implications.
