[Docs] Add "Using Java Builders" section (#26517)

The current "Building Queries" and "Building Aggregations" pages are
located under the "Supported Apis" section because they are linked to
the "Search API" page.

It should instead be in a dedicated section: this commit adds a new
"Using Java Builders" section and renames few filenames in favor of
more meaningful names.
