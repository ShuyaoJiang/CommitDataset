Add links to external classes in clients javadoc (#25998)

The client sniffer depends on the low-level REST client, while the Java high-level REST client and the transport client depend on Elasticsearch itself. Javadoc are not that useful unless they have links to the Elasticsearch classes in the latter case, and to the low-level REST client in the sniffer javadoc. This commit adds those links.
