Build: Remove padding from java version in build info (#36088)

This commit removes padding from the java version in the output of
compiler/runtime/gradle java versions. This value is only ever 1 or 2
digits, and the later information (hotspot/jvm vendor info) is separated
by the java home path from the other versions, so there isn't a visual
reason for needing exact vertical alignment.
