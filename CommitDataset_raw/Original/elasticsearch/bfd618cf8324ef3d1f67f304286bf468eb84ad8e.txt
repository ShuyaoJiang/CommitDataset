Universal cluster bootstrap method for tests with autoMinMasterNodes=false (#38038)

Currently, there are a few tests that use autoMinMasterNodes=false and
hence override addExtraClusterBootstrapSettings, mostly this is 10-30
lines of codes that are copy-pasted from class to class.

This PR introduces `InternalTestCluster.setBootstrapMasterNodeIndex`
which is suitable for all classes and copy-paste could be removed.

Removing code is always a good thing!
