[ML] Minor improvements to categorization Grok pattern creation (#33353)

1. The TOMCAT_DATESTAMP format needs to be checked before
   TIMESTAMP_ISO8601, otherwise TIMESTAMP_ISO8601 will
   match the start of the Tomcat datestamp.
2. Exclude more characters before and after numbers.  For
   example, in 1.2.3 we don't want to match 1.2 as a float.
