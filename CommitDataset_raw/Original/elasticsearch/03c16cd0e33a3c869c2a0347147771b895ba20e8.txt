Painless: Add PainlessClassBuilder (#32141)

Several pieces of data in PainlessClass cannot be passed in at the time the 
PainlessClass is created so it must be "frozen" after all the data is collected. This means 
PainlessClass is currently serving two functions as both a builder and a set of data. This 
separates the two pieces into clearly distinct values.

This change also removes the PainlessMethodKey in favor of a simple String. The goal is 
to have the painless method key be completely internal to the PainlessLookup eventually 
and this simplifies the way there. Note that this was added since PainlessClass and 
PainlessClassBuilder were already being changed instead of a follow up PR.
