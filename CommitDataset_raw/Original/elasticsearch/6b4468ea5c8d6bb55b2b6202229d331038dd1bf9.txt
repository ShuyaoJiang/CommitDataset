Clear security caches on security index health changes (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1957)

This change clears the caches in the native realm and the composite roles store when there is a
a change in the health of the security index that necessitates this. When the security index goes
to a red state, the caches are left in tact as this allows for management operations to be
performed for a limited amount of time. When the index transitions out of the red state or exists
when it didn't exist before, the caches will be cleared so that we remove any stale values.
