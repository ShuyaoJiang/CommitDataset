Add persistent tasks

Persistent tasks are build on top of node tasks and provide functionality to restart a task to run on a different coordination node in case the coordinating node is no longer available.
It is up to a persistent task implementation to keep track of status, so that in case the task is restarted, the task can continue were it left off before it was restarted.
