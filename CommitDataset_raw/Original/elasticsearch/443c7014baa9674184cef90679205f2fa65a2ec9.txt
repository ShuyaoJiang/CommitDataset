Make TransportClusterStateAction abide to our style (#30697)

I still do not like == false. However, I am so use to reading it that
today I read this line of code and could not understand how it could
possibly be doing the right thing. It was only when I finally noticed
the ! that the code made sense. This commit changes this code to be in
our style of == false. I still do not like == false.
