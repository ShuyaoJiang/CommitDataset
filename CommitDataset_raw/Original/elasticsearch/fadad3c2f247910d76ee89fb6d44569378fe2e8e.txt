Relax testStressMaybeFlushOrRollTranslogGeneration (#38918)

The predicate shouldPeriodicallyFlush is determined by the uncommitted
translog size and the local checkpoint. The uncommitted translog size
depends on the local checkpoint. The condition shouldPeriodicallyFlush
can be true twice in in the test in the following scenario:

1. Index doc-0 and advances the local checkpoint to 0, the condition
shouldPeriodicallyFlush remains false.

2. Index doc-1 and add it to translog, but the local checkpoint is not
advanced yet (still 0). The condition shouldPeriodicallyFlush becomes
true because the uncommitted translog size is 216bytes (2ops + gen-1 +
gen-2) > 180bytes and the translog generation of the new index commit
would advance from 1 to 2.

1. The shouldPeriodicallyFlush becomes true again after the local
checkpoint is advanced to 1 because the uncommitted translog size is
216bytes (2ops + gen-2 + gen-3) > 180bytes and the translog generation
of the new index commit would advance from 2 to 4.

We need to relax the assertion in this test to cover this situation.
