Fix scripts when launching from bin

When running a script that depends on elasticsearch-env, the
elasticsearch-env script seeks backwards from the directory containing
the script to find Elasticsearch home. This is done by seeking backwards
in the path to find bin, and then going one directory above
that. Unfortunately, if the script is started relatively from the bin
directory, then bin will appear in the path since it is a relative
path. This commit fixes this by making the starting path absolute before
attempting to seek backwards.
