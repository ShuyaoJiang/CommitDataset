Fix percolator highlight sub fetch phase to not highlight query twice (#26622)

* Fix percolator highlight sub fetch phase to not highlight query twice

The PercolatorHighlightSubFetchPhase does not override hitExecute and since it extends HighlightPhase the search hits
are highlighted twice (by the highlight phase and then by the percolator). This does not alter the results, the second highlighting
just overrides the first one but this slow down the request because it duplicates the work.
