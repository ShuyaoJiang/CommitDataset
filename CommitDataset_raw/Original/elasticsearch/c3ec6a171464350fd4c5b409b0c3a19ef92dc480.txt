Honor masking of systemd-sysctl.service

During package install on systemd-based systems, some sysctl settings
should be set (e.g. vm.max_map_count).

In some environments, changing sysctl settings plainly does not work;
previously a global environment variable named
ES_SKIP_SET_KERNEL_PARAMETERS was introduced to skip calling sysctl, but
this causes trouble for:
 - configuration management systems, which usually cannot apply an env
   var when running a package manager
 - package upgrades, which will not have the env var set any more, and
   thus leaving the package management system in a bad state (possibly
   half-way upgraded, can be very hard to recover)

This removes the env var again and instead of calling systemd-sysctl
manually, tells systemd to restart the wrapper unit - which itself can
be masked by system administrators or management tools if it is known
that sysctl does not work in a given environment.

The restart is not silent on systems in their default configuration, but
is ignored if the unit is masked.
