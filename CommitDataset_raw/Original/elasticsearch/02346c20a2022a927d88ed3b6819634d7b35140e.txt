Rankeval: Fold template test project into main module (#31203)

This change moves tests in `smoke-test-rank-eval-with-mustache` into the main
ranking evaluation module by declaring that the integration testing cluster
requires the `lang-mustache` plugin. This avoids having to maintain the qa
project for only one basic test suite.
