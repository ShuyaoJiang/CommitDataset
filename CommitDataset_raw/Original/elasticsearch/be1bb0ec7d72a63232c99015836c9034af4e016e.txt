Remove types from Monitoring plugin "backend" code (#37745)

This PR removes the use of document types from the monitoring exporters and template + watches setup code.

It does not remove the notion of types from the monitoring bulk API endpoint "front end" code as that code will eventually just go away in 8.0 and be replaced with Beats as collectors/shippers directly to the monitoring cluster.
