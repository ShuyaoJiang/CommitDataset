Security: make native realm usage stats accurate (#30824)

The native realm's usage stats were previously pulled from the cache,
which only contains the number of users that had authenticated in the
past 20 minutes. This commit changes this so that we pull the current
value from the security index by executing a search request. In order
to support this, the usage stats for realms is now asynchronous so that
we do not block while waiting on the search to complete.
