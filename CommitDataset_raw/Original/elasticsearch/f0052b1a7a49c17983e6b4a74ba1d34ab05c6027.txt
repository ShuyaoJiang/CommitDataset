Add hybridfs store type

With this commit we introduce a new store type `hybridfs` that is a
hybrid between `mmapfs` and `niofs`. This store type chooses different
strategies to read Lucene files based on the read access pattern (random
or linear) in order to optimize performance.

This store type has been available in earlier versions of Elasticsearch
as `default_fs`. We have chosen a different name now in order to convey
the intent of the store type instead of tying it to the fact whether it
is the default choice.
