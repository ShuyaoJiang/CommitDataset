Make remote cluster resolution stricter (#40419)

Remote cluster resolution is currently lenient, to support local
indices that may contain `:` in their name. From 8.0 on, there can no
longer be indices in the cluster that contain `:` in their name, hence
we can make remote cluster resolution stricter. Instead of treating
any index expression containing a `:` whenever there is no corresponding
matching remote cluster registered, we now throw a
`NoSuchRemoteClusterException`.
