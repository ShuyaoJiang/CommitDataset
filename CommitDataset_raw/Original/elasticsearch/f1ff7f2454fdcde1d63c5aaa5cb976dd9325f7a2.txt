Require a field when a `seed` is provided to the `random_score` function. (#25594)

We currently use fielddata on the `_id` field which is trappy, especially as we
do it implicitly. This changes the `random_score` function to use doc ids when
no seed is provided and to suggest a field when a seed is provided.

For now the change only emits a deprecation warning when no field is supplied
but this should be replaced by a strict check on 7.0.

Closes #25240
