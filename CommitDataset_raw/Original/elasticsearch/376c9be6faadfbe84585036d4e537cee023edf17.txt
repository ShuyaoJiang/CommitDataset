Watcher: Ensure reloading happens based on watch index instead of alias (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1544)

The cluster state listener to decide if watcher should be reloaded was
assuming that no aliases could be used and thus wrongly could trigger
a reload, which could have lead to wrong test results.

During debugging I also added a reason for reloading and fixed another
wrong test assumption.

Also the listener does not rely on previous cluster state, but stores this
in instance variable, as we need to compare with local state and not the
previous cluster state.
