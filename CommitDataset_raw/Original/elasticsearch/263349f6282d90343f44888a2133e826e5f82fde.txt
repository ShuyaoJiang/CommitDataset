Decouple TimeValue from Elasticsearch server classes (#29454)

* Decouple TimeValue from Elasticsearch server classes

This commit decouples the `TimeValue` class from the other server classes. This
is in preperation to move `TimeValue` into the `elasticsearch-core` jar,
allowing us to use it from projects that cannot depend on the elasticsearch-core
library.

Relates to #28504
