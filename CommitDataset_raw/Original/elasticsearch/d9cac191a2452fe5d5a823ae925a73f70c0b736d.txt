Fix missing active IDs prevent advance test

This commit addresses an issue in the missing active IDs prevent advance
test from the global checkpoint tracker. The assumptions this test was
making about reality were violated when global checkpoints were inlined
(specifically, the component of that change where the tracker's
knowledge of the global checkpoint was updated inline with updates to
the tracker's knowledge of local checkpoints for an allocatio ID). The
point of the test was to ensure that a lagging shard prevents the global
checkpoint from advancing, so this commit rewrites the test with that in
mind.
