Ensure relocation occur in testRelocationWithConcurrentIndexing (#40801)

If the relocation is throttled, the subsequent search request on the
target node (i.e., with preference _only_nodes=target_node) will fail
because some shards have not moved to that node yet. With this change,
we will wait for the relocation happens by busily checking the routing
table of the testing index on the target node.
