SQL: Fix MOD() for long and integer arguments (#36599)

Previously, Math.floorMod was used for integers and longs
which has different logic for negative numbers. Also, the
priority of data types check was wrong as if one of the args
is double the evaluation should be with doubles, then for floats,
then longs and finally integers.
