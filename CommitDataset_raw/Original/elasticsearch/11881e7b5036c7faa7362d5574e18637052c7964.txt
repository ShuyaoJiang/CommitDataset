Empty GetAliases authorization fix (#34444)

This fixes a bug about aliases authorization.
That is, a user might see aliases which he is not authorized to see.
This manifests when the user is not authorized to see any aliases
and the `GetAlias` request is empty which normally is a marking
that all aliases are requested. In this case, no aliases should be
returned, but due to this bug, all aliases will have been returned.
