Trigger log4j loading prior to context classloader (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4355)

OpenSAML requires that the context classloader be set to the
classloader that contains the opensaml jar files in order to
initialise itself. However, sometimesrthis seems to cause the
classloading for slf4j/log4j to take place while that context
classloader is set, which fails.

This change forces slf4j/log4j to be initialised prior to setting
the context classloader.
