Deprecate types in get_source and exist_source (#36426)

This change adds a new untyped endpoint `{index}/_source/{id}` for both the
GET and the HEAD methods to get the source of a document or check for its
existance. It also adds deprecation warnings to RestGetSourceAction that emit
a warning when the old deprecated "type" parameter is still used. Also updating
documentation and tests where appropriate.
