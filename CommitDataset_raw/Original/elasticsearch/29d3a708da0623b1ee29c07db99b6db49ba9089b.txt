Fix BulkWithUpdatesIT and CloseIndexIT

As of today the Close Index API does its best to close indices,
but closing an index with ongoing recoveries might or might not
be acknowledged depending of the values of the max seq number
and global checkpoint at the time the
TransportVerifyShardBeforeClose action is executed.

These tests failed because they always expect that the index is
correctly closed on the first try, which is not always the case.
Instead we need to retry the closing until it succeed.

Closes #37571
