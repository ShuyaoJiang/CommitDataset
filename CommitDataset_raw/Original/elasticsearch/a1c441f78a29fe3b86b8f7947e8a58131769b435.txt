HLRC: Add throttling for update & delete-by-query (#33951)

This change adds throttling to the update-by-query and delete-by-query cases
similar to throttling for reindex. This mostly means additional methods on the
client class itself, since the request hits the same RestHandler, just with
slightly different endpoints, and also the return values are similar.
