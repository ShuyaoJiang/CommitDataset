Fix expected plugins test for transport-nio

We have a packaging test that tries to install all plugins, and then
asserts that all expected plugins are installed. The expected plugins
are dervied from the list of plugins in the plugins sub-project. The
plugin transport-nio was recently added here, but explicit commands to
install and remove this plugin were never added. This commit addresses
this.
