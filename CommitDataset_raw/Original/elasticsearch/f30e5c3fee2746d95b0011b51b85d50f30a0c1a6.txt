Register the legacy truststore password setting for the PKI realm (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2487)

After the addition of the secure settings in 5.6, the truststore.password setting for the PKI realm
was no longer registered. This would cause new nodes to fail for customers that were upgrading and
had configured a PKI realm with a truststore. This change registers the setting and adds a test to
ensure a realm configuration with the old setting passes validation.
