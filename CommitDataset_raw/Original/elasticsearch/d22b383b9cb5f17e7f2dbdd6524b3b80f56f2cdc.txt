SQL: Fix issue with options for QUERY() and MATCH(). (#33828)

Previously multiple comma separated lists of options where not
recognized correctly which resulted in only the last of them
to be taked into account, e.g.:

For the following query:
  SELECT * FROM test WHERE QUERY('search', 'default_field=foo', 'default_operator=and')"
only the `default_operator=and` was finally passed to the ES query.

Fixes: #32602
