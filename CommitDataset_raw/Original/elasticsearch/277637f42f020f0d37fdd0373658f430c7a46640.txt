Do not set SO_LINGER on server channels (#26997)

Right now we are attempting to set SO_LINGER to 0 on server channels
when we are stopping the tcp transport. This is not a supported socket
option and throws an exception. This also prevents the channels from
being closed.

This commit 1. doesn't set SO_LINGER for server channges, 2. checks
that it is a supported option in nio, and 3. changes the log message
to warn for server channel close exceptions.
