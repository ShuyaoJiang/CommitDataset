Stop using basic license in put license test

This is related to elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4095. That test uses the a basic license in a test
of the route put license. Occasionally, that license is extended due to
recent work related to indefinite basic licenses before the test
assertions can be performed. This commit changes the test to use a gold
license.
