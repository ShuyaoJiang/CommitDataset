Manage dependencies for test clusters (#35304)

* Manage dependencies for test clusters

Create a configuration and add the distribution to it automatically.
A task is created and added as a dependency to any task that uses a test
cluster.
The task extracts all the zip archives ( only zip support for now )
in the configuration.
We do this only once because most tests mostly use the same distribution
and thus we can avoid extracting it multiple times.
With this we will be able to start the node from the same files which
will most of the time live in OS caches or COW if the
configuration requires it.
