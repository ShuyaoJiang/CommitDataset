Decouple XContentBuilder from BytesReference (#28972)

* Decouple XContentBuilder from BytesReference

This commit removes all mentions of `BytesReference` from `XContentBuilder`.
This is needed so that we can completely decouple the XContent code and move it
into its own dependency.

While this change appears large, it is due to two main changes, moving
`.bytes()` and `.string()` out of XContentBuilder itself into static methods
`BytesReference.bytes` and `Strings.toString` respectively. The rest of the
change is code reacting to these changes (the majority of it in tests).
