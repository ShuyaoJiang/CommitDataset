Fix setting by time unit (#37192)

This commit fixes an issue with a settings builder method that allows
setting a duration by time unit. In particular, this method can suffer
from a loss of precision. For example, if the input duration is 1500
microseconds then internally we are converting this to "1ms",
demonstrating the loss of precision. Instead, we should internally
convert this to a TimeValue that correctly represents the input
duration, and then convert this to a string using a method that does not
lose the unit. That is what this commit does.
