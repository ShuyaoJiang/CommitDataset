Fix handling of points_only with term strategy in geo_shape (#31766)

Fixes 2 issues that together cause errors during index creation
with geo_shapes that use the term strategy. The term strategy changes
the default for points_only parameter, but this wasn't taken into
account during serialization. So, setting the term strategy would add
`"points_only": true` to serialization. At the same time if the term
strategy would also cause the `points_only` setting to be not marked as
a processed element during parsing, which would cause index creation to
fail with the error: `Mapping definition for [location] has unsupported`
`parameters:  [points_only : true]`.

Fixes #31707
