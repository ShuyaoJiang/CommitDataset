Watcher: Add support for scheme in proxy configuration (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3614)

This adds support to allow different schemes in a proxy being used
compared to what the actual request requires. So if your proxy runs via
HTTP, but the endpoint you want to connect to uses HTTPS, this is now
possible to configure the proxy explicitely.

Also a small unit test for parsing this has been added.
