Fix PreConfiguredTokenFilters getSynonymFilter() implementations (#38839)

When we added support for TokenFilterFactories to specialise how they were used when parsing
synonym files, PreConfiguredTokenFilters were set up to either apply themselves, or be ignored.
This behaviour is a leftover from an earlier iteration, and also has an incorrect default.

This commit makes preconfigured token filters usable in synonym file parsing by default, and brings
those filters that should not be used into line with index-specific filter factories; in indexes created
before version 7 we emit a deprecation warning, and we throw an error in indexes created after.

Fixes #38793
