Inc store reference before refresh (#28656)

If a tragic even happens while we are refreshing a searcher/reader the engine can open new files on a store that is already closed
For instance the following CI job failed because a merge was concurrently called on a failing shard:
https://elasticsearch-ci.elastic.co/job/elastic+elasticsearch+master+oracle-java10-periodic/84
This change increments the ref count of the store during a refresh in order to postpone the closing after a tragic event.
