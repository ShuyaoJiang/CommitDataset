Remove Joda usage from ILM (#35220)

This commit removes the Joda time usage from ILM and the HLRC components of ILM.
It also fixes an issue where using the `?human=true` flag could have caused the
parser not to work. These millisecond fields now follow the standard we use
elsewhere in the code, with additional fields added iff the `human` flag is
specified.

This is a breaking change for ILM, but since ILM has not yet been released, no
compatibility shim is needed.
