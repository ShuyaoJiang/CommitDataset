Handle MatchNoDocsQuery in span query wrappers (#34106)

* Handle MatchNoDocsQuery in span query wrappers

This change adds a new SpanMatchNoDocsQuery query that replaces
MatchNoDocsQuery in the span query wrappers.
The `wildcard` query now returns MatchNoDocsQuery if the target field is not
in the mapping (#34093) so we need the equivalent span query in order to
be able to pass it to other span wrappers.

Closes #34105
