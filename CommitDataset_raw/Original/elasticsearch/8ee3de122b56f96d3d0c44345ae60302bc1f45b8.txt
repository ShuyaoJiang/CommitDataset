Build: Remove x-pack-api jar (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3864)

The api jar was added for xpack extensions. However, extensions have
been removed in favor of using SPI, and the individual xpack jars like
core and security are published to enable this. This commit removes the
api jar, and switches the transport client to use the core jar (which
the api jar was just a rename of).
