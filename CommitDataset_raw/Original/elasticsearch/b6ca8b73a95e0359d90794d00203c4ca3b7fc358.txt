[ML] Addressing bug streaming DatafeedConfig aggs from (<= 6.5.4) -> 6.7.0 (#40610) (#40660)

* Addressing stream failure and adding tests to catch such in the future

* Add aggs to full cluster restart tests

* Test BWC for datafeeds with and without aggs

The wire serialisation is different for null/non-null
aggs, so it's worth testing both cases.
