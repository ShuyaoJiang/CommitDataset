Fix testRunStateChangePolicyWithAsyncActionNextStep race condition (#40707)

Previously we only set the latch countdown with `nextStep.setLatch` after the
cluster state change has already been counted down. However, it's possible
execution could have already started, causing the latch to be missed when the
`MockAsyncActionStep` is being executed.

This moves the latch setting to be before the call to
`runPolicyAfterStateChange`, which means it is always available when the
`MockAsyncActionStep` is executed.

I was able to reproduce the failure every 30-40 runs before this change. With
this change, running 2000+ times the test passes.

Resolves #40018
