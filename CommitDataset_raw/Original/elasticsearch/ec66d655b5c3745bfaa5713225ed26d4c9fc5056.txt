Rename client artifacts (#25693)

It was brought up that our current client artifacts have generic names like 'rest' that may cause conflicts with other artifacts.

This commit renames:

- rest -> elasticsearch-rest-client
- sniffer -> elasticsearch-rest-client-sniffer
- rest-high-level -> elasticsearch-rest-high-level-client

A couple of small changes are also preparing the high level client for its first release.

Closes #20248
