SQL: Introduce NOW/CURRENT_TIMESTAMP function (#36562)

Add CURRENT_TIMESTAMP as keyword as well function alongside NOW() 
 These return the current date/time for the  given query, computed when
 the statement reaches the server. For completeness, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
 also accepts precision as an optional parameter.
