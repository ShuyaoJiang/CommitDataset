This change adds Expected Reciprocal Rank (ERR) as a ranking evaluation metric
as descriped in:

Chapelle, O., Metlzer, D., Zhang, Y., & Grinspan, P. (2009).

ERR is an extension of the classical reciprocal rank to the graded relevance
case and assumes a cascade browsing model. It quantifies the usefulness of a
document at rank `i` conditioned on the degree of relevance of the items at ranks
less than `i`. ERR seems to be gain traction as an alternative to (n)DCG, so it
seems like a good metric to support. Also ERR seems to be the default optimization
metric used for training in RankLib, a widely used learning to rank library.
