Add finalReduce flag to SearchRequest (#38104)

With #37000 we made sure that fnial reduction is automatically disabled
whenever a localClusterAlias is provided with a SearchRequest.

While working on #37838, we found a scenario where we do need to set a
localClusterAlias yet we would like to perform a final reduction in the
remote cluster: when searching on a single remote cluster.

Relates to #32125

This commit adds support for a separate finalReduce flag to
SearchRequest and makes use of it in TransportSearchAction in case we
are searching against a single remote cluster.

This also makes sure that num_reduce_phases is correct when searching
against a single remote cluster: it makes little sense to return
`num_reduce_phases` set to `2`, which looks especially weird in case
the search was performed against a single remote shard. We should
perform one reduction phase only in this case and `num_reduce_phases`
should reflect that.
