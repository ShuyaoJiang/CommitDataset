Add get file chunk timeouts with listener timeouts (#38758)

This commit adds a `ListenerTimeouts` class that will wrap a
`ActionListener` in a listener with a timeout scheduled on the generic
thread pool. If the timeout expires before the listener is completed,
`onFailure` will be called with an `ElasticsearchTimeoutException`.

Timeouts for the get ccr file chunk action are implemented using this
functionality. Additionally, this commit attempts to fix #38027 by also
blocking proxied get ccr file chunk actions. This test being un-muted is
useful to verify the timeout functionality.
