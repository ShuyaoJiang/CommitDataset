[ML] Fix categorization integration test following fix to C++ code (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3483)

The categorization integration tests were picking up a bug in the C++
categorization code, but the expected results were set incorrectly to
match the incorrect C++ output.  This change adjusts the expected
results to reflect what is really expected.  It also mutes the tests
to avoid failures while the C++ fix propagates through the build
process.  The tests will be unmuted tomorrow.
