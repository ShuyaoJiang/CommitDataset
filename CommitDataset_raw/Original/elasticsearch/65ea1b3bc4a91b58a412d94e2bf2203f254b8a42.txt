Tests: Remove unneeded classes, fix AwaitsFix watcher tests (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2139)

Fix TemplateTransformMappingTests to work, even if date rolls over
during execution.

Reenable test in BootStrapTests, was forgotten.

Remove the SecurityF/MonitoringF/WatcherF classes, as there is a gradle
command to easily start elasticsearch with xpack

Remove HasherBenchmark, as it is not a test and relies on RandomContext
that is not available anymore (also I think a JMH benchmark would be
needed here).

Remove ManualPublicSmtpServersTester, was not usable anymore.

Remove OldWatcherIndicesBackwardsCompatibilityTests, now in dedicated
rolling upgrade tests.

Remove unused EvalCron class.
