[Rollup] Register FeatureSetUsage with xpack, add tests (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4040)

We had a Usage class before, but weren't registering it with XPack.
Would be nice to add more usage info in the future (like the running
jobs on each node), but unclear the best way to do it since we'd need
to filter through the list of allocated tasks.
