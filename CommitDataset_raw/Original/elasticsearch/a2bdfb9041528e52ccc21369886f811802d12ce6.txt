Packaging: Update marker used to allow ELASTIC_PASSWORD (#37243)

This commit updates the file docker's entrypoint script looks for when
deciding to process the ELASTIC_PASSWORD env var. The x-pack subdir
of bin no longer exists in 7.0, where the backcompat layer for x-pack
script locations was removed.
