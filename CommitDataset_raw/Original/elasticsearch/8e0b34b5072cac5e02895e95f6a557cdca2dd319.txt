Override indexing plans

Operations from a leader shard will be indexed into the engine with the
origin set to primary. The problem is here is that then we have primary
semantics in the engine such as assertions about sequence numbers being
unassigned, and we do not have correct semantics for out-of-order
delivery of operations (as we should on a following engine, whether or
not it is primary since the ordering is determined from the
leader). This commit handles this by always using the replica plan for
indexing into a following engine, whether or not the engine is for a
primary shard.
