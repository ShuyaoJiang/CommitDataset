[Tests] Improve error message for failed xContentEquivalent() tests (#24828)

For comparing actual and parsed object equality for the response parsing we
currently rely on comparing the original xContent and the output of the parsed 
object. Currently we only have cryptic error messages if this comparison fails 
which are hard to read also because we recursively compare lists and maps of 
the xContent structures we compare.

This commits leverages the existing NotEqualMessageBuilder for providing error 
messages  that are more detailed and useful for debugging if an error occurs.
