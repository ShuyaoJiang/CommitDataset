Add ranking evaluation API to High Level Rest Client (#28357)

This change adds support for the new ranking evaluation API to the High Level Rest Client.
This mostly means adding support for parsing the various response objects back from the
REST representation. It includes one change to the response syntax where previously we didn't
print the type of the metric details section but we now need it to pick the right parser to
parse this section back.

Closes #28198
