Remove parse field deprecations in query builders (#26711)

The `fielddata` field and the use of the `_name` field in the short syntax of the range 
query have been deprecated in 5.0 and can be removed.

The same goes for the deprecated `score_mode` field in HasParentQueryBuilder,
the deprecated `like_text`, `ids` and `docs` parameter in the `more_like_this` query,
the deprecated query name in the short version of the `regexp` query, and several
deprecated alternative field names in other query builders.
