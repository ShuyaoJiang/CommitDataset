remove index.lifecycle.skip setting (#34823)

With the introduction of _ilm/stop and _ilm/start APIs, the
use cases where one would only target a select group
of indices to start/stop has been reduced. Since there is no
strong use-case for skipping specific indices, it is best to
remove this functionality and only adding if later desired, with the
hopes of keeping things more simple.
