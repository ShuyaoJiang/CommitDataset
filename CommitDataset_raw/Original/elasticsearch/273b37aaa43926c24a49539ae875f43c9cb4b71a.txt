Make the ingest-geoip databases even lazier to load (#36679)

Today we try to load the ingest-geoip databases lazily. Currently they
are loaded as soon as any pipeline that uses an ingest-geoip processor
is created. This is not lazy enough. For example, we could only load the
databases the first time that they are actually used. This would ensure
that we load the minimal set of data to support an in-use pipeline
(instead of *all* of the data). This can come up in a couple of
ways. One is when a subset of the database is used (e.g., the city
database versus the country database versus the ASN database). Another
is when the plugins are installed on non-ingest nodes (e.g., master-only
nodes); we would never use the database in this case yet they are
currently being loaded occupying ~60 MB of the heap. This commit makes
the ingest-geoip databases as lazy as possible.
