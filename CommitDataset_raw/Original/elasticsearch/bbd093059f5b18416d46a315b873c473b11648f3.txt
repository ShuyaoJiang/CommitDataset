Add whitelist to watcher HttpClient (#36817)

This adds a configurable whitelist to the HTTP client in watcher. By
default every URL is allowed to retain BWC. A dynamically configurable
setting named "xpack.http.whitelist" was added that allows to
configure an array of URLs, which can also contain simple regexes.
