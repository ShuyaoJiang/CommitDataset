Deprecate `nGram` and `edgeNGram` names for ngram filters (#30209)

The camel case name `nGram` should be removed in favour of `ngram` and
similar for `edgeNGram` and `edge_ngram`. Before removal, we need to
deprecate the camel case names first. This change adds deprecation
warnings for indices with versions 6.4.0 and higher and logs deprecation
warnings.
