Security: cleanup code in file stores (#30348)

This commit cleans up some code in the FileUserPasswdStore and the
FileUserRolesStore classes. The maps used in these classes are volatile
so we need to make sure that we don't perform multiple operations with
the map unless we are sure we are using a reference to the same map.

The maps are also never null, but there were a few null checks in the
code that were not needed. These checks have been removed.
