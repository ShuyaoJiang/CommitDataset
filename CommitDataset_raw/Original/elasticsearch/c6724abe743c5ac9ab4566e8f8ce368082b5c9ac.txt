Fix scroll query with a sort that is a prefix of the index sort (#27498)

During a scroll, if the search sort matches the index sort we use the sort values of the last doc returned by
the previous scroll to optimize the main query with a `SearchAfterSortedDocQuery`.
This query can "jump" directly to the first document that sorts after the provided sort values.
This optim is also applied if the search sort is a prefix of the index sort but this case throws an exception
because we use the index sort (instead of the search sort) to validate the sort values of the last document.
This change fixes this bug and adds a test for it.
