CCR/TEST: Limit indexing docs in FollowerFailOverIT (#35228)

The suite FollowerFailOverIT is failing because some documents are not
replicated to the follower. Maybe the FollowTask is not working as
expected or the background indexers eat all resources while the follower
cluster is trying to reform after a failover; then CI is not fast enough
to replicate all the indexed docs within 60 seconds (sometimes I see 80k
docs on the leader).

This commit limits the number of documents to be indexed into the leader
index by the background threads so that we can eliminate the latter
case. This change also replaces a docCount assertion with a docIds
assertion so we can have more information if these tests fail again.
