Handle long paths on Windows for standalone tests

In some cases our Windows builds fail due to long path names that arise
from a combination of long build job names plus long sub-project
names. While newer versions of Windows can handle long paths, invoking
batch scripts longer than 260 characters via cmd.exe is still
problematic. This leads to failing integration tests because we can not
run the commands to install plugins, create the keystore, and start the
node. This commit handles this by converting all paths on Windows used
to start an Elasticsearch node to short path names.
