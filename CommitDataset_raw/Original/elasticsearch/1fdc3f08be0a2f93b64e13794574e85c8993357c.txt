Do not expose hard-deleted docs in Lucene history (#32333)

Today when reading operation history in Lucene, we read all documents.
However, if indexing a document is aborted, IndexWriter will hard-delete
it; we, therefore, need to exclude that document from Lucene history.

This commit makes sure that we exclude aborted documents by using the
hard liveDocs of a SegmentReader if there are deletes.

Closes #32269
