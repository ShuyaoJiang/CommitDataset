Handle installing X-Pack

X-Pack can no longer be installed as a plugin. This commit adds special
handling for when a user attempts to install X-Pack. This special
handling informs the user of the oss distribution that they should
download the default distribution and the user of the default
distribution that X-Pack does not require installation as it is included
by default.
