[TEST] QA resources should not need vagrant provision (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3851)

For the idp-fixture (OpenLDAP + SAML), we have been generating the CA as part of the provisioning steps for the VM and then adding it to the test resources for the gradle project.

This meant that test-resources were dependent on vagrant provision, and as a consequence vagrant would download and provision the box during precommit. A bad thing (TM)

This change introduces a pre-generated CA, which is supplied to the VM instead so the tests only depend on fixed resources.
(The SAML integration test still uses the generated IdP Metadata file, but it copies it as part integ-test cluster setup, and doesn't treat it as a gradle "test resource")
