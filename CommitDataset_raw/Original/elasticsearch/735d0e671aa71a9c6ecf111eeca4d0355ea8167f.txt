Make PreBuiltAnalyzerProviderFactory plugable via AnalysisPlugin and

move `finger_print`, `pattern` and `standard_html_strip` analyzers
to analysis-common module. (both AnalysisProvider and PreBuiltAnalyzerProvider)

Changed PreBuiltAnalyzerProviderFactory to extend from PreConfiguredAnalysisComponent and
changed to make sure that predefined analyzers are always instantiated with the current
ES version and if an instance is requested for a different version then delegate to PreBuiltCache.
This is similar to the behaviour that exists today in AnalysisRegistry.PreBuiltAnalysis and
PreBuiltAnalyzerProviderFactory. (#31095)

Relates to #23658
