Make randomNonNegativeLong() draw from a uniform distribution (#27856)

Currently randomNonNegativeLong() returns 0 half as often as any positive long,
but random number generators are typically expected to return
uniformly-distributed values unless otherwise specified. This fixes this issue
by mapping Long.MIN_VALUE directly onto 0 rather than resampling.
