Subclass NIOFSDirectory instead of using FileSwitchDirectory (#37140)

We don't want two FSDirectories manage pending deletes separately
and optimize file listing. This confuses IndexWriter and causes exceptions
when files are deleted twice but are pending for deletion. This change
move to using a NIOFS subclass that only delegates to MMAP for opening files
all metadata and pending deletes are managed on top.

Closes #37111
Relates to #36668
