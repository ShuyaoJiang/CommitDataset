Guarantee that translog generations are seqNo conflict free (#24825)

With #24779 in place, we can now guaranteed that a single translog generation file will never have a sequence number conflict that needs to be resolved by looking at primary terms. These conflicts can a occur when a replica contains an operation which isn't part of the history of a newly promoted primary. That primary can then assign a different operation to the same slot and replicate it to the replica.

PS. Knowing that each generation file is conflict free will simplifying repairing these conflicts when we read from the translog.

PPS. This PR also fixes some bugs in the piping of primary terms in the bulk shard action. These bugs are a result of the legacy of IndexRequest/DeleteRequest being a ReplicationRequest. We need to change that as a follow up.
