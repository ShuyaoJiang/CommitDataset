Setup password tool builds default URL from settings (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2146)

This change makes the setup password tool build the default URL from the settings provided by the
environment. This will ease the amount of work a user would have to do in order to run the tool as
http vs https will be selected automatically and the port/host will as well.
