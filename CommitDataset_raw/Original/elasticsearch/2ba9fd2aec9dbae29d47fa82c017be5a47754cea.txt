Remove deprecated created and found from index, delete and bulk (#25516)

The created and found fields in index and delete responses became obsolete after the introduction of the result field in index, update and delete responses (#19566).

After deprecating the created and found fields in 5.x (#19633), now they are removed.

Fixes #19630
