[ML] More advanced post-test cleanup of ML indices (#39049)

The .ml-annotations index is created asynchronously when
some other ML index exists.  This can interfere with the
post-test index deletion, as the .ml-annotations index
can be created after all other indices have been deleted.

This change adds an ML specific post-test cleanup step
that runs before the main cleanup and:

1. Checks if any ML indices exist
2. If so, waits for the .ml-annotations index to exist
3. Deletes the other ML indices found in step 1.
4. Calls the super class cleanup

This means that by the time the main post-test index
cleanup code runs:

1. The only ML index it has to delete will be the
   .ml-annotations index
2. No other ML indices will exist that could trigger
   recreation of the .ml-annotations index
