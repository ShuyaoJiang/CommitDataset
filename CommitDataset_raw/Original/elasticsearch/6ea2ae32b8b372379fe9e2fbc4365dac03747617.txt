Move DeleteByQuery and Reindex requests into core (#24578)

This allows other plugins to use a client to call the functionality
that is in the core modules without duplicating the logic.
Plugins can now safely send the request and response classes via the
client even if the requests are executed locally. All relevant classes
are loaded by the core classloader such that plugins can share them.
