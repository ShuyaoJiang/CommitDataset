Add typless client side GetIndexRequest calls and response class (#37778)

The HLRC client currently uses `org.elasticsearch.action.admin.indices.get.GetIndexRequest`
and `org.elasticsearch.action.admin.indices.get.GetIndexResponse` in its get index calls. Both request and
response are designed for the typed APIs, including some return types e.g. for `getMappings()` which in
the maps it returns still use a level including the type name.
In order to change this without breaking existing users of the HLRC API, this PR introduces two new request
and response objects in the `org.elasticsearch.client.indices` client package. These are used by the
IndicesClient#get and IndicesClient#exists calls now by default and support the type-less API. The old request
and response objects are still kept for use in similarly named, but deprecated methods.

The newly introduced client side classes are simplified versions of the server side request/response classes since
they don't need to support wire serialization, and only the response needs fromXContent parsing (but no
xContent-serialization, since this is the responsibility of the server-side class).
Also changing the return type of `GetIndexResponse#getMapping` to
`Map<String, MappingMetaData> getMappings()`, while it previously was returning another map
keyed by the type-name. Similar getters return simple Maps instead of the ImmutableOpenMaps that the 
server side response objects return.
