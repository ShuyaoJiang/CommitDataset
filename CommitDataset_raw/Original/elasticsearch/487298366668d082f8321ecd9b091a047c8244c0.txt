Adapt bwc serialization in FieldSortBuilder (#40095)

This change adapts the bwc version check for the new numeric_type option of the FieldSortBuilder.
Since this change needs to be backported to 7x, all bwc tests are temporary disabled
until https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/40084 is merged.
