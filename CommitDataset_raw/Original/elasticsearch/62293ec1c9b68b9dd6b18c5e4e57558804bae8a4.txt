Plugins: Consolidate plugin and module loading code (#28815)

At one point, modules and plugins were very different. But effectively
now they are the same, just from different directories. This commit
unifies the loading methods so they are simply two different
directories. Note that the main codepath to load plugin bundles had
duplication (was not calling getPluginBundles) since previous
refactorings to add meta plugins. Note this change also rewords the
primary exception message when a plugin descriptor is missing, as the
wording asking if the plugin was built before 2.0 isn't really
applicable anymore (it is highly unlikely someone tries to install a 1.x
plugin on any modern version).
