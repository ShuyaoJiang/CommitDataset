Test: tests that use security index should not delete template

Tests that rely on the security index and security index template being present should not remove
the template between tests as this can cause test failures. The template upgrade service relies
on cluster state updates to trigger the template being added after a delete, but there is a
scenario where the test will just wait for template that never shows up as there is no cluster
state update in that time. Instead of fighting ourselves, we should just leave the template in
place.
