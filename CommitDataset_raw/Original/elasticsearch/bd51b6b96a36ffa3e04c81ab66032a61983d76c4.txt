REST hl client: adjust wait_for_active_shards param in cluster health (#31266)

The default wait_for_active_shards is NONE for cluster health, which
differs from all the other API in master, hence we need to make sure to
set the parameter whenever it differs from NONE (0). The test around
this also had a bug, which is why this was not originally uncovered.
