[Test] Fix InstallPluginCommandTests failure on Windows (#28447)

The `testMetaPluginPolicyConfirmation` needs to close the file streams it is
iterating over, otherwise some OSes (like Windows) might not be able to delete
all temporary folders, which in turn leads to test failures.

Closes #28415
