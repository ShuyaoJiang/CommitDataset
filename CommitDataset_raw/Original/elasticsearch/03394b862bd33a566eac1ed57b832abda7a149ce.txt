No mapper service and index caches for replicated closed indices (#40423)

Replicated closed indices can't be indexed into or searched, and therefore don't need a shard with
full indexing and search capabilities allocated. We can save on a lot of heap memory for those
indices by not allocating a mapper service and caching infrastructure (which preallocates a constant
amount per instance). Before this change, a 1GB ES instance could host 250 replicated closed
metricbeat indices (each index with one shard). After this change, the same instance can host 7300
replicated closed metricbeat instances (not that this would be a recommended configuration). Most
of the remaining memory is in the cluster state and the IndexSettings object.
