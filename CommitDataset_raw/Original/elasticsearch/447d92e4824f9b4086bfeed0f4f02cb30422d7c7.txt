Allow not configure logging without config

For CLI tools, we configure logging without reading the
log4j2.properties file. This because any log statements in a CLI tool
should dump to the console while reading from the log4j2.properties file
would cause them to dump whereever the log configuration there indicates
(e.g., possibly a remote machine). To do this, we added some code to the
base implementation of all CLI tools to configure logging without a
config file. This code is also executed when Elasticsearch starts up. In
the past this was fine yet we previously added detection to
Elasticsearch to find cases where we use logging before it is
configured. Because of configuring logging without a config, this means
we only catch uses of logging before the logging without config is
performed. To correct this, we enable a CLI tool to skip enabling
logging without a config and then in the Elasticsearch CLI we indeed
utilize this to skip configuring logging without a config.
