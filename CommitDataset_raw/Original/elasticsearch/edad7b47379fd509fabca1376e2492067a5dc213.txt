Add support for selecting percolator query candidate matches containing range queries.

Extracts ranges from range queries on byte, short, integer, long, half_float, scaled_float, float, double, date and ip fields.
byte, short, integer and date ranges are normalized to Lucene's LongRange.
half_float and float are normalized to Lucene's DoubleRange.

When extracting range queries, the QueryAnalyzer computes the width of the range.  This width is used to determine
what range should be preferred in a conjunction query. The QueryAnalyzer prefers the smaller ranges, because these
ranges tend to match with less documents.

Closes #21040
