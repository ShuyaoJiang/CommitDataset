Primary send safe commit in file-based recovery (#28038)

Today a primary shard transfers the most recent commit point to a 
replica shard in a file-based recovery. However, the most recent commit
may not be a "safe" commit; this causes a replica shard not having a
safe commit point until it can retain a safe commit by itself.

This commits collapses the snapshot deletion policy into the combined 
deletion policy and modifies the peer recovery source to send a safe
commit.
