Keep cumulative elapsed scroll time in microseconds

Today we internally accumulate elapsed scroll time in nanoseconds. The
problem here is that this can reasonably overflow. For example, on a
system with scrolls that are open for ten minutes on average, after
sixteen million scrolls the largest value that can be represented by a
long will be executed. To address this, we switch to internally
representing scrolls using microseconds as this enables with the same
number of scrolls scrolls that are open for seven days on average, or
with the same average elapsed time sixteen billion scrolls which will
never happen (executing one scroll a second until sixteen billion have
executed would not occur until more than five-hundred years had
elapsed).
