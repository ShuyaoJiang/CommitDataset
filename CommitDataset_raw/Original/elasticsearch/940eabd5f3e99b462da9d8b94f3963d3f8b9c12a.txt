Watcher: Add thread pool rejection to execution state (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2805)

The execution state of a watch did not differentiate between failures of
the execution like a broken painless script and a thread pool rejection.

This adds an own state, which allows to aggregate on such data in the
watch history, which should ease debugging issues a bit.
