Add support for providing absolute start time to SearchRequest (#37142)

We have recently added support for providing a local cluster alias to a
SearchRequest through a package protected constructor. When executing
cross-cluster search requests with local reduction on each cluster, the
CCS coordinating node will have to provide such cluster alias to each
remote cluster, as well as the absolute start time of the search action
in milliseconds from the time epoch, to be used when evaluating date
math expressions both while executing queries / scripts as well as when
resolving index names.

This commit adds support for providing the start time together with the
cluster alias. It is a final member in the search request, which will
only be set when using cross-cluster search with local reduction (also
known as alternate execution mode). When not provided, the coordinating
node will determine the current time and pass it through (by calling
`System.currentTimeMillis`).
