serialize suggestion responses as named writeables (#30284)

Suggestion responses were previously serialized as streamables which
made writing suggesters in plugins with custom suggestion response types
impossible. This commit makes them serialized as named writeables and
provides a facility for registering a reader for suggestion responses
when registering a suggester.

This also makes Suggestion responses abstract, requiring a suggester
implementation to provide its own types. Suggesters which do not need
anything additional to what is defined in Suggest.Suggestion should
provide a minimal subclass.

The existing plugin suggester integration tests are removed and
replaced with an equivalent implementation as an example
plugin.
