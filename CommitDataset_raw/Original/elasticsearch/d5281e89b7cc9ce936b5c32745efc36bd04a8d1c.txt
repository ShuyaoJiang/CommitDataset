Watcher: Register HTML sanitizer settings (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3904)

The HTML sanitizer settings were not registered correctly, when the
grouping functionality was removed in elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3685

This registers the settings properly in watcher.

Relates elastic/support-dev-help-elasticsearch#413
