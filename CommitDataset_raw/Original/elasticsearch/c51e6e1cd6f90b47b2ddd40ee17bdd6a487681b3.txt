Remove unnecessary directory push/pop from scripts

This commit proposes removing an unnecessary directory push/pop from the
X-Pack scripts. It is not clear exactly why these were added, the
original change was almost three years ago in
elastic/x-pack@ea9ba7cdd0560cefd53c5d142d98d6c60d4f64b2 but
unfortunately the commit message does not elucidate the exact the
problem, nor is there an associated pull request. This change has
propogated into all of the X-Pack scripts yet still the reasons are
unclear. The little that we can glean from the commit message is that
there was a problem with the default paths if the script was executed
outside of the Elasticsearch home. It seems that such issues have been
addressed by the recent introduction of elasticsearch-env so maybe we
can simplify these scripts here?
