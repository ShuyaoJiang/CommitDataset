Fix AutoQueueAdjustingExecutorBuilder settings validation (#33922)

Settings validation in AutoQueueAdjustingExecutorBuilder always checked against
a default value which means that we never can change a max queue size that is lower
than the default. This change adds tests and fixes this validation.
