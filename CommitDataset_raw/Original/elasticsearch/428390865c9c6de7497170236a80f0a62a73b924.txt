Tests: Give stats tests long to wait for listener

This test waited 10 seconds for a refresh listener to appear in
the stats. It turns out that in our NFS testing infrastructure this can
take a lot longer than 10 seconds. The error reported here:
https://elasticsearch-ci.elastic.co/job/elastic+elasticsearch+master+nfs/257/consoleFull
has it taking something like 15 seconds. This bumps the timeout
to a solid minute.

Closes #24417
