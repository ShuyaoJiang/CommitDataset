Add details section for dcg ranking metric (#31177)

While the other two ranking evaluation metrics (precicion and reciprocal rank)
already provide a more detailed output for how their score is calculated, the
discounted cumulative gain metric (dcg) and its normalized variant are lacking
this until now. Its not really clear which level of detail might be useful for
debugging and understanding the final metric calculation, but this change adds a
`metric_details` section to REST output that contains some information about the
evaluation details.
