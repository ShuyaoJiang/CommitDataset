[CCR] Change get autofollow patterns API response format (#36203)

The current response format is:

```
{
    "pattern1": {
        ...
    },
    "pattern2": {
        ...
    }
}
```

The new format is:

```
{
    "patterns": [
        {
            "name": "pattern1",
            "pattern": {
                ...
            }
        },
        {
            "name": "pattern2",
            "pattern": {
                ...
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

This format is more structured and more friendly for parsing and generating specs.
This is a breaking change, but it is better to do this now while ccr
is still a beta feature than later.
