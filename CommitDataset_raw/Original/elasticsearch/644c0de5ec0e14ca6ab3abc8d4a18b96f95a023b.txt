Move non duplicated actions back into xpack core (#32952)

Most actions' request and response were moved from xpack core into
protocol. We have decided to instead duplicate the actions in the HLRC
instead of trying to reuse them. This commit moves the non duplicated
actions back into xpack core and severs the tie between xpack core and
protocol so no other actions can be moved and not duplicated.
