Expose external refreshes through the stats API (#38643)

Right now, the stats API only provides refresh metrics regarding
internal refreshes. This isn't very useful and somewhat misleading for
cluster administrators since the internal refreshes are not indicative
of documents being available for search.

In this PR I added a new metric for collecting external refreshes as
they occur and exposing them through the stats API. Now, calling an
endpoint for stats will yield external refresh metrics as well.
