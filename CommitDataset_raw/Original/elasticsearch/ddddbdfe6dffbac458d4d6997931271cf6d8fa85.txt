Reduce retention lease sync intervals (#40302)

This commit adjusts the frequency with which CCR renews retention leases
and with which primaries sync retention leases to replicas. This helps
Lucene reclaim soft-deleted documents more aggressively, which we have
found in some use-cases can help improve performance, and either way
will help keep disk space under more control.
