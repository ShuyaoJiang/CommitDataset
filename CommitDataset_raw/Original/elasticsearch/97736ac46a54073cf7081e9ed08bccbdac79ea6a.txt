Logging: Skip test if it'd fail

If we're running on a platform where we can't install syscall filters
Elasticsearch logs a message before it reads the data directory to get
the node name. Because that log message doesn't have a node name this
test will fail. Since we mostly run the test on OSes where we *can*
install the syscall filters we can fairly safely skip the test on OSes
where we can't install the syscall filters.

Closes #33540
