Tests: Ensure watcher is started in REST tests (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1702)

This adds a check in the REST tests to ensure that
watcher is started, and if not, tries to start watcher.

This eliminates test failures where watcher was not in
the correct state due to other tests stopping watcher.
