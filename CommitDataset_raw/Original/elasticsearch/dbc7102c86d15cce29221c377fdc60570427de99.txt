Fix inner hits retrieval when stored fields are disabled (_none_) (#33018)

Now that types are unique per mapping we can retrieve the document mapper
without referencing the type. This fixes an NPE when stored fields are disabled.
For 6x we'll need a different fix since mappings can still have multiple types.
