Watcher: Execute Watch API returns better error message (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4228)

Many users take the JSON from an PUT watch API and put it into the
execute watch API and then start to wonder why there is an error, as
they forget to wrap the watch inside a 'watch' field.

This commit adds a better error message in this case hinting at the user
to add a 'watch' field.
