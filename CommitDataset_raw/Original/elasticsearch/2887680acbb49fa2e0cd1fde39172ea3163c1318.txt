Avoid NPE in follower stats when no tasks metadata (#35802)

When there is no persistent tasks metadata we could hit a null pointer
exception when executing a follower stats request. This is because we
inspect the persistent tasks metadata. Yet, if no tasks have been
registered, this is null (as opposed to empty). We need to avoid
de-referencing the persistent tasks metadata in this case. That is what
this commit does, and we add a test for this situation.
