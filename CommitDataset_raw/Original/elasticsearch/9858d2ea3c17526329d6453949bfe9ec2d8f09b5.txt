Migrate remaining compare tests to IT

Migrates the remaining comparison tests to integration tests
so they run easilly in gradle against real Elasticsearch nodes.

This breaks running them in the IDE without running an Elasticsearch
node and setting `-Drest.test.cluster=localhost:9200`. You can run
a compatible node with `cd sql-clients/jdbc && gradle run`.
