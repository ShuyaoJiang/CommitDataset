Add cache cleaning task for ML snapshot (#37505)

The ML subproject of xpack has a cache for the cpp artifact snapshots
which is checked on each build. The cache is outside of the build dir so
that it is not wiped on a typical clean, as the artifacts can be large
and do not change often. This commit adds a cleanCache task which will
wipe the cache dir, as over time the size of the directory can become
bloated.
