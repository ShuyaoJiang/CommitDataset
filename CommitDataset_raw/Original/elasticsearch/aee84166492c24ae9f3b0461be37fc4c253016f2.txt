[ML][TEST] Disable other plugins for internal cluster integ tests (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4285)

ML internal cluster integration tests should not depend on any of
the other plugins. In addition, monitoring can interfere with
some of the tests, making them slower and more fragile. This
reverts a change that got in elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3643.
