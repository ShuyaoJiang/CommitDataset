Remove 6.1.5 version constant

The assumption here is that we will no longer be making a release from
the 6.1 branch. Since we assume that all versions on this branch are
actually released, we do not want to leave behind any versions that
would require a snapshot build. We do have a test that verifies that all
released versions are present here, so if another release is performed
from the 6.1 branch, that test will fail and we will know to add the
version constant at that time.
