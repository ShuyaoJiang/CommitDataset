Treat aliases as unavailable indices in delete index and update aliases api (#25524)

When resolving wildcards, aliases should be treated as unavailable indices when the `ignoreAliases` option is set to `true` (currently enabled with delete index api and update aliases api). This way the `allow_no_indices` and `ignore_unavailable` options can be honoured, otherwise WildcardExpressionResolver ends up treating aliases differently and there is no way to control when an error is thrown.

The default behaviour for the delete index api, which has `ignore_unavailable` set to `false` and `allow_no_indices` set to `true` by default, is to throw an error when executed against an alias, same as when it's executed against an index that does not exist.
