Do not open indices with broken settings

Today we are lenient and we open an index if it has broken
settings. This can happen if a user installs a plugin that registers an
index setting, creates an index with that setting, stop their node,
removes the plugin, and then restarts the node. In this case, the index
will have a setting that we do not recognize yet we open the index
anyway. This leniency is dangerous so this commit removes it. Note that
we still are lenient on upgrades and we should really reconsider this in
a follow-up.
