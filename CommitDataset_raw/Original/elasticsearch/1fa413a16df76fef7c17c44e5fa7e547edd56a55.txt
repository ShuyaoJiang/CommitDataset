[ML] Remove "8" prefixes from file structure finder timestamp formats (#38016)

In 7.x Java timestamp formats are the default timestamp format and
there is no need to prefix them with "8".  (The "8" prefix was used
in 6.7 to distinguish Java timestamp formats from Joda timestamp
formats.)

This change removes the "8" prefixes from timestamp formats in the
output of the ML file structure finder.
