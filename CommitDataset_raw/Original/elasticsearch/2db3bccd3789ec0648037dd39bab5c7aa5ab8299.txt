Invalid JSON request body caused endless loop (#26680)

Request bodys that only consists of a String value can lead to endless loops in the
parser of several rest requests like e.g. `_count`. Up to 5.2 this seems to have been caught 
in the logic guessing the content type of the request, but since then it causes the node to
block. This change introduces checks for receiving a valid xContent object before starting the
parsing in RestActions#parseTopLevelQueryBuilder().

Closes #26083
