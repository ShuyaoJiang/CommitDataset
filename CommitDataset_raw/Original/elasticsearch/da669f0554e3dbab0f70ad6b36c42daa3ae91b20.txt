Add fromXContent method to SearchResponse (#24720)

SearchResponse#fromXContent allows to parse a search response, including search hits, aggregations, suggestions and profile results. Only the aggs that we can parse today are supported (which means all of them but a couple that are left to support). SearchResponseTests reuses the existing test infra to randomize aggregations, suggestions and profile response.
