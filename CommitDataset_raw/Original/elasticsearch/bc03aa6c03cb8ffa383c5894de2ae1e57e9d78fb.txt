Line up sql serialization methods with core's (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2538)

This renames that `write` and `read` methods in SQL to `writeTo` and
`readFrom` to line up with the names used in core. I don't have a
strong opinion whether or not any name is better than any other but
I figure there isn't a good reason for SQL to be different from the
rest of Elasticsearch.
