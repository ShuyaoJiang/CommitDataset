Fix the MapperFieldType.rangeQuery API. (#26552)

RangeQueryBuilder needs to perform too many `instanceof` checks in order to
check for `date` or `range` fields in order to know what it should do with the
shape relation, time zone and date format.

This commit adds those 3 parameters to the `rangeQuery` factory method so that
those instanceof checks are not necessary anymore.
