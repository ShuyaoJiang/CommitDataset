Remove special handling for _all in nodes info

Today when requesting _all we return all nodes regardless of what other
node qualifiers are in the request. This is contrary to how the
remainder of the API behaves which acts as additive and subtractive
based on the qualifiers and their ordering. It is also contrary to how
the wildcard * behaves. This commit removes the special handling for
_all so that it behaves identical to the wildcard *.
