Stop auto-followers on shutdown (#40124)

When shutting down a node, auto-followers will keep trying to run. This
is happening even as transport services and other components are being
closed. In some cases, this can lead to a stack overflow as we rapidly
try to check the license state of the remote cluster, can not because
the transport service is shutdown, and then immeidately retry
again. This can happen faster than the shutdown, and we die with stack
overflow. This commit adds a stop command to auto-followers so that this
retry loop occurs at most once on shutdown.
