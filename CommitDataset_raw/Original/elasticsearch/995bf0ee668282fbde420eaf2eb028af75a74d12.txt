Bulk Api support for global parameters (#34528)

Bulk Request in High level rest client should be consistent with what is
possible in Rest API, therefore should support global parameters. Global
parameters are passed in URL in Rest API.

Some parameters are mandatory - index, type - and would fail validation
if not provided before before the bulk is executed.
Optional parameters - routing, pipeline.

The usage of these should be consistent across sync/async execution,
bulk processor and BulkRequestBuilder
