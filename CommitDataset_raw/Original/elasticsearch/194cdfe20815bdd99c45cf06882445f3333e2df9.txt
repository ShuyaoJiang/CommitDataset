Sync retention leases on expiration (#37902)

This commit introduces a sync of retention leases when a retention lease
expires. As expiration of retention leases is lazy, their expiration is
managed only when getting the current retention leases from the
replication tracker. At this point, we callback to our full retention
lease sync to sync and flush these on all shard copies. With this
change, replicas do not locally manage expiration of retention leases;
instead, that is done only on the primary.
