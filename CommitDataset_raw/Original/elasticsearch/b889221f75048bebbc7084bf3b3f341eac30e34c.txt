Types removal - deprecate include_type_name with index templates (#37484)

Added deprecation warnings for use of include_type_name in put/get index templates.
HLRC changes:
GetIndexTemplateRequest has a new client-side class which is a copy of server's GetIndexTemplateResponse but modified to be typeless.
PutIndexTemplateRequest has a new client-side counterpart which doesn't use types in the mappings
