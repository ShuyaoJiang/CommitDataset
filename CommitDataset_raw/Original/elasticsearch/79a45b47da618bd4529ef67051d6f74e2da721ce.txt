Recover retention leases during peer recovery (#38435)

This commit integrates retention leases with recovery. With this change,
we copy the current retention leases on primary to the replica during
phase two of recovery. At this point, the replica will have been added
to the replication group and so is already receiving retention lease
sync requests from the primary. This means that if any retention lease
syncs are triggered on the primary after we sample the retention leases
here during phase two, that sync request will also arrive on the replica
ensuring that the replica is from this point on up to date with the
retention leases on the primary. We have to copy these during phase two
since we will be applying indexing operations, potentially triggering
merges, and therefore must ensure the correct retention leases are in
place beforehand.
