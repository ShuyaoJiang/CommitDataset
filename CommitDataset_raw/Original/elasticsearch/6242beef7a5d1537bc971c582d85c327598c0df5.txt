[ML] Use scaling thread pool and xpack.ml.max_open_jobs cluster-wide dynamic (#39320)

This change does the following:

1. Makes the per-node setting xpack.ml.max_open_jobs
   into a cluster-wide dynamic setting
2. Changes the job node selection to continue to use the
   per-node attributes storing the maximum number of open
   jobs if any node in the cluster is older than 7.1, and
   use the dynamic cluster-wide setting if all nodes are on
   7.1 or later
3. Changes the docs to reflect this
4. Changes the thread pools for native process communication
   from fixed size to scaling, to support the dynamic nature
   of xpack.ml.max_open_jobs
5. Renames the autodetect thread pool to the job comms
   thread pool to make clear that it will be used for other
   types of ML jobs (data frame analytics in particular)
