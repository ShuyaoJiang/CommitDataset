[ML] Add meta information to all ML indices (#37964)

This change adds a _meta field storing the version in which
the index mappings were last updated to the 3 ML indices
that didn't previously have one:

- .ml-annotations
- .ml-meta
- .ml-notifications

All other ML indices already had such a _meta field.

This field will be useful if we ever need to automatically
update the index mappings during a future upgrade.
