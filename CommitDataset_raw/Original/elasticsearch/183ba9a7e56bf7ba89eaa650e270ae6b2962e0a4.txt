Fix typo in max number of threads check docs (#29469)

Historically, the bootstrap checks used 2048 as the minimum limit for
the maximum number of threads. This limit was guided by the fact that
the number of processors was artificially capped at 32. This limit was
removed in 6.0.0 and the minimum limit was raised to 4096 to accommodate
this. However, the docs were not updated and this commit addresses that
miss.
