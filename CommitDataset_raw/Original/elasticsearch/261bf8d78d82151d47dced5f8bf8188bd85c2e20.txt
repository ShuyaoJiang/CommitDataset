[Test] LocalExporterTests should wait for exporters to terminate in a finally block (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1581)

At the end of the test, LocalExporterTests checks if no more monitoring
 data are exporter by checking multiple times the last time nodes_stats
 documents were exported, stopping after 10 seconds. It does this in a
 @After annotated method but it would be better to do this in a finally
 block. Also, it should search for node_stats documents only if the
 monitoring indices exist and are searchable to avoid some "all shards
 failed" failures.
