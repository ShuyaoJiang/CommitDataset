Fix the ability to remove old plugin

We now read the plugin descriptor when removing an old plugin. This is
to check if we are removing a plugin that is extended by another
plugin. However, when reading the descriptor we enforce that it is of
the same version that we are. This is not the case when a user has
upgraded Elasticsearch and is now trying to remove an old plugin. This
commit fixes this by skipping the version enforcement when reading the
plugin descriptor only when removing a plugin.
