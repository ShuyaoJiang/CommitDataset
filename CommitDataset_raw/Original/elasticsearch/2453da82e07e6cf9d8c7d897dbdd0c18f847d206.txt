Force evaluation order between sub-plugins and core

We are relying on the fact that :x-pack-elasticsearch:plugin:core is
configured before these. This happens when these projects are
alphabetically after core, but is not the case when they are not
(ccr). To address this, we simplfy be explicit about evaluation order in
all sub-plugins.
