Fix using relative custom config path

Previously a user could set a custom config path to a relative directory
using ES_PATH_CONF. In a previous change related to enabling GC logging
by default, we forced the working directory for Elasticsearch to be
ES_HOME. This had the impact of causing all relative paths to be
relative to ES_HOME, against the intent of the user. This commit
addresses this by making ES_PATH_CONF absolute before we switch the
working directory to ES_HOME.
