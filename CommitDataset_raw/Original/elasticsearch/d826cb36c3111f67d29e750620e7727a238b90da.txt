Remove version read/write logic in Verify Response (#30879)

Since master will always communicate with a >=6.4 node, the logic for
checking if the node is 6.4 and conditionally reading and writing based
on that can be removed from master. This logic will stay in 6.x as it is
the bridge to the cleaner response in master. This also unmutes the
failing test due to this bwc change.

Closes #30807
