SQL: Fix parsing of dates with milliseconds (#30419)

Dates internally contain milliseconds (which appear when converting them
to Strings) however parsing does not accept them (and is being strict).
The parser has been changed so that Date is mandatory but the time
(including its fractions such as millis) are optional.
