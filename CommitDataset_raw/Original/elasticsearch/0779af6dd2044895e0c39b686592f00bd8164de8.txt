Move uid lock into LiveVersionMap (#27905)

While the LiveVersionMap is an internal class that belongs to the engine we do
rely on some external locking to enforce the desired semantics.  Yet, in tests
we mimic the outer locking but we don't have any way to enforce or assert on
that the lock is actually hold.  This change moves the KeyedLock inside the
LiveVersionMap that allows the engine to access it as before but enables
assertions in the LiveVersionMap to ensure the lock for the modifying or
reading key is actually hold.
