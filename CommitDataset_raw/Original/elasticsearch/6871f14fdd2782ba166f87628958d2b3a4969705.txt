Fix possible assertion failure in IndicesQueryCache.close (#38714)

The assertion that the stats2 map is empty in
IndicesQueryCache.close has been observed to
fail very occasionally in internal cluster tests.

The likely cause is a cross-thread visibility
problem for a count variable.  This change
makes that count volatile.
