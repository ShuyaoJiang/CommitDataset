Fix interoperability with < 6.3 transport clients (#30971)

With the default distribution changing in 6.3, clusters might now contain custom metadata that a
pure OSS transport client cannot deserialize. As this can break transport clients when accessing
the cluster state or reroute APIs, we've decided to exclude any custom metadata that the transport
client might not be able to deserialize. This will ensure compatibility between a < 6.3 transport
client and a 6.3 default distribution cluster. Note that this PR only covers interoperability with older
clients, another follow-up PR will cover full interoperability for >= 6.3 transport clients where we will
make it possible again to get the custom metadata from the cluster state.
