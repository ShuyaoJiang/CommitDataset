[TEST] Correctly verify that aliases were deleted in MlJobIT

This fixes `testDeleteJobAfterMissingAliases` to not fail randomly.
The reason the test was failing is that at some point some aliases
are deleted and the cat-aliases API is called to verify they were
indeed deleted. This was checked by asserting an
index_not_found_exception was thrown by the cat-aliases request.
This was some times working as there were no other aliases. However,
that depends on whether other x-pack features had time to create their
infrastructure. For example, security creates an alias. When other
aliases had the time to be created, the cat-aliases request does not
fail and the test fails.

This commit simply changes the verification that the read/write
aliases were deleted by replacing the cat-aliases request with
two single get-alias requests.
