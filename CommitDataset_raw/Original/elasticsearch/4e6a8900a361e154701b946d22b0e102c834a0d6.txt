Add periodic flush count to flush stats (#29360)

Currently, a flush stats contains only the total flush which is the sum
of manual flush (via API) and periodic flush (async triggered when the
uncommitted translog size is exceeded the flush threshold). Sometimes,
it's useful to know these two numbers independently. This commit tracks
and returns a periodic flush count in a flush stats.
