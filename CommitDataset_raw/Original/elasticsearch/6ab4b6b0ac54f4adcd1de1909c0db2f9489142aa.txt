revamp TransportRequest handlers to support Writeable (#26315)

This PR begins the long journey to deprecating Streamable.

The idea here is to add additional method signatures that
support Writeable.Reader, so that the work to migrate objects TransportMessage to
implement Writeable and not Streamable.

One example conversion is done in this PR: SimulatePipelineRequest.
