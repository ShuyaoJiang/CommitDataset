Explain why Elasticsearch doesn't support incremental resharding. (#29082)

I have seen this question a couple times already, most recently at
https://twitter.com/dimosr7/status/973872744965332993

I tried to keep the explanation as simple as I could, which is not always easy
as this is a matter of trade-offs.
