Speed up rejected execution contains node name test

This commit addresses slowness in the test that a rejected execution
contains the node name. The slowness came from setting the count on a
countdown latch too high (two in the case of the search thread pool)
where there would never be a second countdown on the latch. This means
that when then test node is shutting down, closing the node would have
to wait a full ten seconds before forcefully terminating the thread
pool. This commit fixes the issue so that the node can close
immediately, shaving ten seconds off the run time of the test.
