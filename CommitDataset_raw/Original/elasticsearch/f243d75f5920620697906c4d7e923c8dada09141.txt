Remove special-casing of Synonym filters in AnalysisRegistry (#34034)

The synonym filters no longer need access to the AnalysisRegistry in their
constructors, so we can remove the special-case code and move them to the
common analysis module.

This commit means that synonyms are no longer available for `server` integration tests,
so several of these are either rewritten or migrated to the common analysis module
as rest-spec-api tests
