remove requirement for shards/replicas in allocation check steps (#30855)

As we are preparing to support policy updates/changes, we noticed
that restricting allocation wait steps with pinned replicas/shard
counts makes this difficult to continue from. For example,
as user may update or switch a policy to increase replicas. If this
is done, then the check will never pass and user intervention will
be required. If we simply remove this restriction, we still check
that the index is allocated correctly, but without depending on
the newly configured replicas setting in the policy.
