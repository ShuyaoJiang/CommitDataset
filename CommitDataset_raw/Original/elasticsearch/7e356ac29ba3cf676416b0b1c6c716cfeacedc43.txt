[Zen2] Introduce auto_shrink_voting_configuration setting (#35217)

Today we allow the user to set the minimum size of a voting configuration. On
reflection we would rather this was simply '3' where possible, and we can use
the retirement API to control the removal of nodes more explicitly.

This change replaces the old reconfigurator setting with a new one,
`cluster.auto_shrink_voting_configuration`, which determines whether
Elasticsearch should automatically remove nodes from the voting configuration
or not.
