Generalize search.remote settings to cluster.remote (#33413)

With features like CCR building on the CCS infrastructure, the settings
prefix search.remote makes less sense as the namespace for these remote
cluster settings than does a more general namespace like
cluster.remote. This commit replaces these settings with cluster.remote
with a fallback to the deprecated settings search.remote.
