Test: Only sniff host metadata for node_selectors (#32750)

Our rest testing framework has support for sniffing the host metadata on
startup and, before this change, it'd sniff that metadata before running
the first test. This prevents running these tests against
elasticsearch installations that won't support sniffing like Elastic
Cloud. This change allows tests to only sniff for metadata when they
encounter a test with a `node_selector`. These selectors are the things
that need the metadata anyway and they are super rare. Tests that use
these won't be able to run against installations that don't support
sniffing but we can just skip them. In the case of Elastic Cloud, these
tests were never going to work against Elastic Cloud anyway.
