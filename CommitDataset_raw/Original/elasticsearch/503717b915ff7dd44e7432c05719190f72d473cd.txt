Build: allow building snapshot of release branches (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1582)

This allows us to build both 5.5.0-SNAPSHOT and 5.4.1-SNAPSHOT
artifacts for backwards compatibility testing. It is a port of
elastic/elasticsearch:24870 to x-pack and will be super useful
when elastic/elasticsearch:24846 is ported to x-pack.
