Make security tests transport agnostic (#39411)

Currently there are two security tests that specifically target the
netty security transport. This PR moves the client authentication tests
into `AbstractSimpleSecurityTransportTestCase` so that the nio transport
will also be tested.

Additionally the work to build transport configurations is moved out of
the netty transport and tested independently.
