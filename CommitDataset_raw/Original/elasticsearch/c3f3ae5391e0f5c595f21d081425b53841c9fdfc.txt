Watcher: Remove all traces from execution on master node (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2383)

As there are no master node operations anymore.

* TransportActions are regular Actions now
* Watcher requests are now ActionRequests, no MasterNodeRequests anymore
* REST spec does not contain master node timeout parameters anymore
* WatcherLifeCycleService does not have a check anymore if watcher is able to run distributed, this will be a given in 7.0
* Some serialization BWC checks against version 5 have been removed
