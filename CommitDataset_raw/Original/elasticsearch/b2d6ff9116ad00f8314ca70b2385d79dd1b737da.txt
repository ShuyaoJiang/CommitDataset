Settings: Add keystore.seed auto generated secure setting (#26149)

This commit adds a keystore.seed setting that is automatically
generated when the ES keystore is created. This setting may be used by
plugins as a secure, random value. This commit also auto creates the
keystore upon startup to ensure the new setting is always available.
