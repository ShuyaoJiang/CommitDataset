[Security] Correct DN matches in role-mapping rules (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3704)

Changes the behaviour of the role mapping API to perform a "DistinguishedNameMatch"
when the field is a DN. This is achieved by moving the responsibility for defining
the matching rules from the expression to the data (ExpressionModel)

Because the role mapping API is used within the SAML realm, which may or may not be
using DNs, this implementation assumes that the "dn" and "groups" should be
compared as DNs if they parse as a DN.
For SAML this behaviour will generally do the right thing, as members of the "groups"
field might be DNs (if the data is sourced from an LDAP directory) but often will not be.
