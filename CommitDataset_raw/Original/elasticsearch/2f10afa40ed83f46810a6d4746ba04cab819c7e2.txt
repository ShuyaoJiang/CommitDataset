Use explicit settings for simple bool settings (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1871)

We made the mistake to generate way to many settings in xpack which makes
finding out the right string and where it's defined super difficult. If
we use constants we can just use commandline tools to find where the settings
are defined. This also removes 1.x and 2.x BWC from the enabled settings which should
be removed in 6.x
