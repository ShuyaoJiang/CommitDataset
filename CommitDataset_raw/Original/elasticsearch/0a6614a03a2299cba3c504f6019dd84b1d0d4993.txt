Correct implemented interface of ParsedReverseNested (#35455)

The ParsedReverseNested implementation should implement the ReverseNested
interface and not the Nested interface. Although this is an empty marker
interface it is confusing and can lead to casting errors. Also adding a test to
check that both ParsedNested and ParsedReverseNested implement the correct
interface.

Closes #35449
