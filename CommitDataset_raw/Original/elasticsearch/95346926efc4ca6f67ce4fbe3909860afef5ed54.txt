SQL: Lock down JDBC driver (#35798)

Move classes under the same package to avoid internal classes being
 exposed to the outside. Remove public visibility outside 3 classes:
 EsDriver, EsDataSource and EsTypes.
The driver only has one package, namely org.elasticsearch.xpack.sql.jdbc
Use Es prefix for classes to ease name conflict and indicate their
 destination
