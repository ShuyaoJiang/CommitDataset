Run Third party audit with forbidden APIs CLI  (part3/3) (#33052)

The new implementation is functional equivalent with the old, ant based one.
It parses task standard error to get the missing classes and violations in the same way.
I considered re-using ForbiddenApisCliTask but Gradle makes it hard to build inheritance with tasks that have task actions , since the order of the task actions can't be controlled.
This inheritance isn't dully desired either as the third party audit task is much more opinionated and we don't want to expose some of the configuration.
We could probably extract a common base class without any task actions, but probably more trouble than it's worth.

Closes #31715
