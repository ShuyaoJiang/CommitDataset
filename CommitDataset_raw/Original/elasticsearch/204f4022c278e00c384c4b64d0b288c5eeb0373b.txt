percolator: Do not take duplicate query extractions into account for minimum_should_match attribute

If a percolator query contains duplicate query clauses somewhere in the query tree then
when these clauses are extracted then they should not affect the msm.

This can lead a percolator query that should be a valid match not become a candidate match,
because at query time, the msm that is being used by the CoveringQuery would never match with
the msm used at index time.

Closes #28315
