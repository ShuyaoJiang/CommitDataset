HLRC: add client side RefreshPolicy (#33209)

With the switch to client side request and response objects, we need a
client side version of RefreshPolicy. This change adds a client side
version of RefreshPolicy along with a method to add it to the
parameters of a request. The existing method to add
WriteRequest.RefreshPolicy to the parameters of a request is now
deprecated.
