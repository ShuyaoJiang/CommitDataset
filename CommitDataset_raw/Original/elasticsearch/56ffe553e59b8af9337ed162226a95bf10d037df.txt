Modify pipelining handlers to require full requests (#31280)

Currently the http pipelining handlers seem to support chunked http
content. However, this does not make sense. There is a content
aggregator in the pipeline before the pipelining handler. This means the
pipelining handler should only see full http messages. Additionally, the
request handler immediately after the pipelining handler only supports
full messages.

This commit modifies both nio and netty4 pipelining handlers to assert
that an inbound message is a full http message. Additionally it removes
the tests for chunked content.
