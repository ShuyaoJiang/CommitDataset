Fix java time epoch date formatters (#37829)

The self written epoch date formatters were not properly able to format
an Instant to a string due to a misconfiguration.

This fix also removes a until now existing runtime behaviour under java
8 regarding the names of the aggregation buckets, which are now the same
as before and have been under java 11.
