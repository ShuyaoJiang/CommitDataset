Simplify testSendSnapshotSendsOps (#37445)

The test testSendSnapshotSendsOps is currently using a mock instance of
RecoveryTargetHandler which will be hard to modify when we make the
RecoveryTargetHandler non-blocking. This commit prepares for the
incoming changes by replacing the mock instance with a stub.
