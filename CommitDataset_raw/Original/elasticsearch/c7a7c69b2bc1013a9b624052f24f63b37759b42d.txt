Simplify NioChannel creation and closing process (#25504)

Currently an NioChannel is created and it is UNREGISTERED. At some point
it is registered with a selector. From that point on, the channel can
only be closed by the selector. The fact that a channel might not be
associated with a selector has significant implications for concurrency
and the channel shutdown process. The only thing that is simplified by
allowing channels to be in a state independent of a selector is some
testing scenarios.

This PR modifies channels so that they are given a selector at creation
time and are always associated with that selector. Only that selector
can close that channel. This simplifies the channel lifecycle and
closing intricacies.
