SQL: Fix issue with optimization on queries with ORDER BY/LIMIT (#40256)

Previously, when a trival plain `SELECT` or a trivial `SELECT` with
aggregations has also an `ORDER BY` or a `LIMIT` or both, then the
optimization to convert it to a `LocalRelation` was skipped resulting
in exception thrown. E.g.::
```
SELECT 'foo' FROM test LIMIT 10
```
or
```
SELECT 'foo' FROM test GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1
```

Fixes: #40211
