Factor UnknownNamedObjectException into its own class (#28931)

* Factor UnknownNamedObjectException into its own class

This moves the inner class `UnknownNamedObjectException` from
`NamedXContentRegistry` into a top-level class. This is so that
`NamedXContentRegistry` doesn't have to depend on StreamInput and StreamOutput.

Relates to #28504
