[ML] Remove record_count from ML mappings (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2183)

record_count is no longer written to new results, but is still tolerated
for backwards compatibility.  However, in the backwards compatibility case
the results index must already contain the required mapping.  There's no
need to add this mapping to newly created results indices.
