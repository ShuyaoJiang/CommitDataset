Update geo_shape docs to include unsupported features (#38138)

There are a two major features that are not yet supported by BKD Backed geo_shape: MultiPoint queries, and CONTAINS relation. It is important we are explicitly clear in the documentation that using the new approach may not work for users that depend on these features. This commit adds an IMPORTANT NOTE section to geo_shape docs that explicitly highlights these missing features and what should be done if they are an absolute necessity.
