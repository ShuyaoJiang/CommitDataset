Modify state of VerifyRepositoryResponse for bwc (#30762)

The VerifyRepositoryResponse class holds a DiscoveryNode[], but the
nodes themselves are not serialized to a REST API consumer. Since we do
not want to put all of a DiscoveryNode over the wire, be it REST or
Transport since its unused, this change introduces a BWC compatible
change in ser/deser of the Response. Anything 6.4 and above will
read/write a NodeView, and anything prior will read/write a
DiscoveryNode. Further changes to 7.0 will be introduced to remove the
BWC shim and only read/write NodeView, and hold a List<NodeView> as the
VerifyRepositoryResponse internal state.
