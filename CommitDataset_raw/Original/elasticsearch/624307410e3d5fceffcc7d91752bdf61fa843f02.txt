[ML] Create the ML annotations index (#36731)

The ML UI now provides the ability for users to annotate
time periods with arbitrary text to add insight to what
happened.

This change makes the backend create the index for these
annotations, together with read and write aliases to
make future upgrades possible without adding complexity
to the UI.

It also adds read and write permission to the index for
all ML users (not just admins).

The spec for the index is in
