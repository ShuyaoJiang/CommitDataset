Change query field expansion (#33020)

This commit changes the query field expansion for query parsers
to not rely on an hardcoded list of field types. Instead we rely on
the type of exception that is thrown by MappedFieldType#termQuery to
include/exclude an expanded field.

Supersedes #31655

Closes #31798
