Remove animal sniffer from low-level REST client (#29646)

The low-level REST client targets JDK 7. To avoid compiling against JDK
functionality not available in JDK 7, we use animal sniffer. However,
when we switched to using the JDK 9 and now the JDK 10 compiler which
has built-in support for targeting previous JDKs, we no longer need to
use animal sniffer. This is because the JDK is now packaged with the
signatures needed to ensure that when we target JDK 7 at compile-time it
is detected that we are only using JDK 7 functionality. This commit
removes the use of animal sniffer from the low-level REST client build.
