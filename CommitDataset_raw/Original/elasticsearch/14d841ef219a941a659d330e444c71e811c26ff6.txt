Handle null SSLSessions during invalidation (#34130)

The SSLService invalidates SSLSessions when there is a change to any of
the underlying key or trust material. However, this invalidation code
did not check for a null SSLSession being returned from the context and
assumed that the context would always return a non-null object. The
return of a null object is possible in all versions, but JDK11 seems to
return them more often due to changes for TLS 1.3. There are a number
of reasons that we get a id of a session but the context returns null
when the session with that id is requested. Some of the reasons for
this are:

* Session was evicted by session cache
* Session has timed out
* Session has been invalidated by another caller

To handle this, the SSLService now checks if the value is null before
calling invalidate on the SSLSession.
