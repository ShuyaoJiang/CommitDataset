Ensure nested documents have consistent version and seq_ids (#27455)

Today we index dummy values for seq_ids and version on nested documents.
This is on the one hand trappy since users can request these values via
inner hits and on the other hand not necessarily good for compression since
the dummy value will likely not compress well when seqIDs are lowish.

This change ensures that we share the same field values for all documents in a
nested block. This won't have any overhead, in-fact it might be more efficient since
we even reduce the work needed slightly.
