Remove BytesArray and BytesReference usage from XContentFactory (#29151)

* Remove BytesArray and BytesReference usage from XContentFactory

This removes the usage of `BytesArray` and `BytesReference` from
`XContentFactory`. Instead, a regular `byte[]` should be passed. To assist with
this a helper has been added to `XContentHelper` that will preserve the offset
and length from the underlying BytesReference.

This is part of ongoing work to separate the XContent parts from ES so they can
be factored into their own jar.

Relates to #28504
