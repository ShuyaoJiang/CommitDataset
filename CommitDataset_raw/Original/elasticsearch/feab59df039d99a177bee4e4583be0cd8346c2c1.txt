Bubble exceptions up in ClusterApplierService (#37729)

Exceptions thrown by the cluster applier service's settings and cluster appliers are bubbled up, and
block the state from being applied instead of silently being ignored. In combination with the cluster
state publishing lag detector, this will throw a node out of the cluster that can't properly apply
cluster state updates.
