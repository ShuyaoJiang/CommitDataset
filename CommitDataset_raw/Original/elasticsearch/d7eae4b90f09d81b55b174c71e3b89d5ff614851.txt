Pass InputStream when creating XContent parser (#28754)

* Pass InputStream when creating XContent parser

Rather than passing the raw `BytesReference` in when creating the xcontent
parser, this passes the StreamInput (which is an InputStream), this allows us to
decouple XContent from BytesReference.

This also removes the use of `commons.Booleans` so it doesn't require more
external commons classes.
