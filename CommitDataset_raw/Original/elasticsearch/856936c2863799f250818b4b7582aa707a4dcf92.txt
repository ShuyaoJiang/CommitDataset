REST Client: NodeSelector for node attributes (#31296)

Add a `NodeSelector` so that users can filter the nodes that receive
requests based on node attributes.

I believe we'll need this to backport #30523 and we want it anyway.

I also added a bash script to help with rebuilding the sniffer parsing
test documents.
