Use the correct Environment object in NativeControllerHolder (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2847)

We should not be constructing a temporary Environment object in production
code.  This currently isn't causing any problems, but it might in the future
if elastic/elasticsearch#27144 or something similar is ever merged.  Instead
the master Environment of the node should always be used.
