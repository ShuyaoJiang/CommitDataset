TEST: Corrupt some translog files used in recovery (#27887)

Currently, method corruptTranslogFiles corrupts some translog files
whose translog_gen are at least the min_required_translog_gen from the
translog checkpoint. However this condition is not enough for
recoverFromTranslog to be always failed.  If we corrupt only translog
operations from only translog files whose translog_gen are smaller than
the min_translog_gen of a recovering index commit, recoverFromTranslog
will be ok as we won't read translog operations from those files.

This commit makes sure corruptTranslogFiles to corrupt some translog 
files that will be used in recoverFromTranslog.

Closes #27538
