Modify self-generated basic licenses to not expire (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3952)

This is related to elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3877. It modifies self-generated basic licenses to
(practically) never expire. Specifically, self-generated basic licenses
will be set with an expiration date 1 year before Long.MAX_VALUE 
Additionally, basic licenses with a different expiration date will be
replaced with a new self-generated basic licenses at startup.
