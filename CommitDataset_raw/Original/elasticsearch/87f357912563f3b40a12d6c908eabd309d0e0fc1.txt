Add nanosecond field mapper (#37755)

This adds a dedicated field mapper that supports nanosecond resolution -
at the price of a reduced date range.

When using the date field mapper, the time is stored as milliseconds since the epoch
in a long in lucene. This field mapper stores the time in nanoseconds
since the epoch - which means its range is much smaller, ranging roughly from
1970 to 2262.

Note that aggregations will still be in milliseconds.
However docvalue fields will have full nanosecond resolution
