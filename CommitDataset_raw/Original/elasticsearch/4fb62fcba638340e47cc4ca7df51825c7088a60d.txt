Make CCR resilient against missing remote cluster connections (#36682)

Both index following and auto following should be resilient against missing remote connections.
This happens in the case that they get accidentally removed by a user. When this happens
auto following and index following will retry to continue instead of failing with unrecoverable exceptions.

Both the put follow and put auto follow APIs validate whether the
remote cluster connection. The logic added in this change only exists
in case during the lifetime of a follower index or auto follow pattern
the remote connection gets removed. This retry behavior similar how CCR
deals with authorization errors.
