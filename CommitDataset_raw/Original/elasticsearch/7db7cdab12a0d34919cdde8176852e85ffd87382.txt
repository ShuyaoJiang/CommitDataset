Fixed missed stopping of SchedulerEngine (#39193)

The SchedulerEngine is used in several places in our code and not all
of these usages properly stopped the SchedulerEngine, which could lead
to test failures due to leaked threads from the SchedulerEngine. This
change adds stopping to these usages in order to avoid the thread leaks
that cause CI failures and noise.

Closes #38875
