Security: remove wrapping in put user response (#33512)

This change removes the wrapping of the created field in the put user
response. The created field was added as a top level field in #32332,
while also still being wrapped within the `user` object of the
response. Since the value is available in both formats in 6.x, we can
remove the wrapped version for 7.0.
