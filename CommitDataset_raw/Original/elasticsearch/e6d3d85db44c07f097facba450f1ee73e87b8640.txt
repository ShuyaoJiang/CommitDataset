Ensure latch is counted down in ssl reload test (#37313)

This change ensures we always countdown the latch in the
SSLConfigurationReloaderTests to prevent the suite from timing out in
case of an exception. Additionally, we also increase the logging of the
resource watcher in case an IOException occurs.
