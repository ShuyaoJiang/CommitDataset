Make recovery source partially non-blocking (#37291)

Today a peer-recovery may run into a deadlock if the value of
node_concurrent_recoveries is too high. This happens because the
peer-recovery is executed in a blocking fashion. This commit attempts
to make the recovery source partially non-blocking. I will make three
follow-ups to make it fully non-blocking: (1) send translog operations,
(2) primary relocation, (3) send commit files.
