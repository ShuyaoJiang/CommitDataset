Add analysis modes to restrict token filter use contexts (#36103)

Currently token filter settings are treated as fixed once they are declared and
used in an analyzer. This is done to prevent changes in analyzers that are already
used actively to index documents, since changes to the analysis chain could
corrupt the index. However, it would be safe to allow updates to token
filters at search time ("search_analyzer"). This change introduces a new
property of token filters that allows to mark them as only being usable at search
or at index time. Any analyzer that uses these tokenfilters inherits that property
and can be rejected if they are used in other contexts. This is a first step towards
making specific token filters (e.g. synonym filter) updateable.
