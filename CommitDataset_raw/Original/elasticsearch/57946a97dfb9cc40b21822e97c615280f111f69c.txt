X-Pack-Security: Making setup-passwords work with protected keystores (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3918)

Changes are done in SetupPasswordTool to load the keystore
and set security settings to load password protected keys in SSL configuration.
Check for the verification mode and appropriately use hostname verifier.
Close the keystore after setup-password is complete.
Unit test for CommandLineHttpClient

TODO: TLS documentation needs to be fixed, which will be taken up as a separate
fix due to documentation refactoring in progress.
