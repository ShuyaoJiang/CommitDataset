Do not swallow exceptions in TimedRunnable (#39856)

Executors of type fixed_auto_queue_size (i.e. search / search_throttled) wrap runnables into
TimedRunnable, which is an AbstractRunnable. This is dangerous as it might silently swallow
exceptions, and possibly miss calling a response listener. While this has not triggered any failures in
the tests I have run so far, it might help uncover future problems.
