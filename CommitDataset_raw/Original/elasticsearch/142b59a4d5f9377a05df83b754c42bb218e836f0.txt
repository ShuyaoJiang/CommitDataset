[ML] Use the correct timeout for the process context lock (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2935)

This change should have been made in elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2913.  Now we hold the process
context lock throughout the job close procedure, the timeout for trying
to lock it should be the timeout used for job open/close rather than the
timeout for connecting named pipes.
