[PkiRealm] Invalidate cache on role mappings change (#31510)

PkiRealm caches successful authentications and provides ways to
invalidate the cache. But in some scenario's the cache was not being
invalidated on role mapping change.
PkiRealm does not inform role mapper to be notified for cache
refresh on role mapping updates.
The logic in `TransportClearRealmCacheAction#nodeOperation`
which gets invoked for refreshing cache on realms, considers null or
empty realm names in the request as clear cache on all realms. When
LDAP realm is not present then it clears cache for all realms so it
works fine, but when LDAP realm is configured then role mapper
sends a request with LDAP realm names and so the cache is cleared
only for those realms.

This commit resolves the issue by registering PkiRealm with role
mapper for cache refresh. PkiRealm implements CachingRealm and as it
does not extend CachingUsernamePasswordRealm, have modified the
interface method `refreshRealmOnChange` to accept CachingRealm.
