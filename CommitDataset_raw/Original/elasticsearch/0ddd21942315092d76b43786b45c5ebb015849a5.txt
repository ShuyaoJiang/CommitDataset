Scripting: Add default implementation of close() for ScriptEngine (#24851)

Since groovy was removed, we no longer have any ScriptEngines with
resources to release. We may want to keep the option open for a script
engine to close resources, but this would not be common. This commit
adds a default implementation to ScriptEngine for `close()` to reduce
the boiler plate that must be added for a ScriptEngine implementation.
