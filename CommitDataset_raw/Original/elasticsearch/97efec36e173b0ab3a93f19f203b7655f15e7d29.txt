fix RethrottleTests retry (#38978)

the RethrottleTests assumed that tasks that were
unprepared to rethrottle would bubble up into the
Rethrottle response as an ElasticsearchException
wrapping an IllegalArgumentException. This seems to
have changed to potentially involve further levels of
wrapping.

This change makes the retry logic more resilient to
arbitrary nesting of the underlying IllegalArgumentException
