[CCR] Added auto follow patterns feature (#33118)

Auto Following Patterns is a cross cluster replication feature that
keeps track whether in the leader cluster indices are being created with
names that match with a specific pattern and if so automatically let
the follower cluster follow these newly created indices.

This change adds an `AutoFollowCoordinator` component that is only active
on the elected master node. Periodically this component checks the
 the cluster state of remote clusters if there new leader indices that
match with configured auto follow patterns that have been defined in
`AutoFollowMetadata` custom metadata.

This change also adds two new APIs to manage auto follow patterns. A put
auto follow pattern api:

```
PUT /_ccr/_autofollow/{{remote_cluster}}
{
   "leader_index_pattern": ["logs-*", ...],
   "follow_index_pattern": "{{leader_index}}-copy",
   "max_concurrent_read_batches": 2
   ... // other optional parameters
}
```

and delete auto follow pattern api:

```
DELETE /_ccr/_autofollow/{{remote_cluster_alias}}
```

The auto follow patterns are directly tied to the remote cluster aliases
configured in the follow cluster.

Relates to #33007
