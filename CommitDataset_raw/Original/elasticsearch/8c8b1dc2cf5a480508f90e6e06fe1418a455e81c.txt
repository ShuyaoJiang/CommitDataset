Fix index with unknown setting test

This commit fixes the test of an index with an unknown setting. The
problem here is that we were manipulating the index state on disk, but a
cluster state update could arrive between us manipulating the index
state on disk and us restarting the node, leading to the index state
that we just intentionally broke being fixed. As such, after restart,
the index state would not be in the state that we expected it to be in
and the test would fail. To address this, we hook into the restart and
break the index state immediately before the node is started again.
