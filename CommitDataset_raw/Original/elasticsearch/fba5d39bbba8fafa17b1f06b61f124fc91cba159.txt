Fix completion suggester's score tie-break (#34508)

The shard suggestion sort uses a different tie-break than the one that is used
to merge different shards responses. The former uses the internal document identifier
when scores are the same whereas the latter compares the surface form first.
Because of this discrepancy some suggestion outputs are linked to the wrong documents
because the merge sort reorders the shard suggestions differently. This change
fixes this bug by duplicating the Lucene collector in order to be able to apply the
same tiebreak strategy than the merge sort. This logic will be removed when
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-8529 is fixed.

Closes #34378
