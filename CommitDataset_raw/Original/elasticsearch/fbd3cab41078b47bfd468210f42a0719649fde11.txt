[Zen2] Remove AbstractComponent usage (#35483)

AbstractComponent was deprecated in #35140 and is looking like it will be
removed at some point by #34888. Today all it does is provide a logger. This
change removes the usages of AbstractComponent that live solely in the zen2
feature branch to avoid some future merge pain, and replaces it where necessary
with some directly-created loggers.
