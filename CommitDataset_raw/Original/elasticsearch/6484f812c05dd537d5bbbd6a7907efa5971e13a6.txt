[ML] Change the root_cause of error responses to be more informative (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1598)

When an error response contains multiple layers of errors, Kibana displays
the one labelled root_cause.  The definition of root_cause is the most
deeply nested ElasticsearchException.  Therefore, it is of great benefit to
the UI if our config validation returns the actual problem in an
ElasticsearchException rather than an IllegalArgumentException.

This commit also adds an extra validation check to catch the case of a
single job config containing fields x.y as well as x earlier.  Previously
this was caught when we tried to create results mappings, and was
accompanied by an error suggesting that using a dedicated results index
would help, when clearly it won't for a clash in a single job config.

Fixes elastic/x-pack-kibana#1387
Fixes elastic/prelert-legacy#349
