Logging: Clean up skipping test

Clean up on top of the last fix: if we skip the entire test case then
the test run would fail because we skipped all the tests. This adds a
dummy test case to prevent that. It is a fairly nasty work around I plan
to work on something that makes this not required any more anyway.
