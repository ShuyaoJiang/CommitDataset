Prevent licenses to be upgraded to production unless TLS is configured (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2502)

if a user tries to upgrade a license to a production license and has security
enabled we prevent the upgrade unless TLS is setup. This is a requirement now
if a cluster with security is running in prodcution.
