Enable smoke-test-watcher with logging (#39169)

SmokeTestWatcherTestSuiteIT.testMonitorClusterHealth has failed a few
times with various causes (not all of which we have logs for).

This change enables the test again.

1. The fix from #39092 should resolve any issues in assertWatchCount
2. In at least 1 case, getWatchHistoryEntry failed due to a
   ResponseException, which is not caught by assertBusy.
   This commit catches those and calls "fail" so that assertBusy will
   sleep and retry
3. Additional logging has been included to help diagnose any other
   failures causes.
