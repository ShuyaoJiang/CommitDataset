SQL: Fix issue with complex HAVING and GROUP BY ordinal (#36594)

When trying to analyse a HAVING condition, we crate a temp Aggregate
Plan which wasn't created correctly (missing the expressions from the
SELECT clause) and as a result the ordinal (1, 2, etc) in the GROUP BY
couldn't be resolved correctly.

Also after successfully analysing the HAVING condition, still the
original plan was returned.

Fixes: #36059
