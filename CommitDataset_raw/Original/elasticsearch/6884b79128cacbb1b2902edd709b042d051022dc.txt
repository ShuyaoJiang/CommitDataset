Add a quick tour of the project to CONTRIBUTING (#30187)

Adds a description of the most important subdirectories to
`CONTRIBUTING.md` to help folks that are less familiar with the project
get their bearings. It reflects that state of the project right now so
it will inevitably go out of date. But I'll try and keep it up to date.
