search as you type fieldmapper (#35600)

Adds the search_as_you_type field type that acts like a text field optimized
for as-you-type search completion. It creates a couple subfields that analyze
the indexed terms as shingles, against which full terms are queried, and a
prefix subfield that analyze terms as the largest shingle size used and
edge-ngrams, against which partial terms are queried

Adds a match_bool_prefix query type that creates a boolean clause of a term
query for each term except the last, for which a boolean clause with a prefix
query is created.

The match_bool_prefix query is the recommended way of querying a search as you
type field, which will boil down to term queries for each shingle of the input
text on the appropriate shingle field, and the final (possibly partial) term
as a term query on the prefix field. This field type also supports phrase and
phrase prefix queries however
