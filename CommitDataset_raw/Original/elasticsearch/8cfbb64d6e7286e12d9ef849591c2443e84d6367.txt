ShardFollowNodeTask should fetch operation once (#32455)

Today ShardFollowNodeTask might fetch some operations more than once.
This happens because we ask the leading for up to max_batch_count
operations (instead of the left-over size) for the left-over request.
The leading then can freely respond up to the max_batch_count, and at
the same time, if one of the previous requests completed, we might issue
another read request whose range overlaps with the response of the
left-over request.

Closes #32453
