Fix `_field_caps` serialization in order to support cross cluster search (#24722)

Today the `_field_caps` API doesn't implement its request serialization
correctly since indices and indices options are not serialized at all.
This will likely break with all transport clients etc. and if this request
must be send across the network. This commit fixes this and adds correct
handling if we have only remote indices to prevent the inclusion of
all local indices.
