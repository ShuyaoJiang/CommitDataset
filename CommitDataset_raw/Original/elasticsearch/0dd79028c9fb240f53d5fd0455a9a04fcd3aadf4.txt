Remove deprecated createParser methods (#28697)

* Remove deprecated createParser methods

This removes the final instances of the callers of `XContent.createParser` and
`XContentHelper.createParser` that did not pass in the `DeprecationHandler`. It
also removes the now-unused deprecated methods and fully removes any mention of
Log4j or LoggingDeprecationHandler from the XContent code.

Relates to #28504
