Test: crank up logging on LicensingTests

We've seen some failures of the LicensingTests that we don't have enough
information to debug:
https://internal-ci.elastic.co/job/elastic+x-pack-elasticsearch+master+periodic/2220/consoleFull

So this cranks up the logging of the bits we expect to see the failures
in.
