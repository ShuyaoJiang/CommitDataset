[ML] Allow asynchronous job deletion (#34058)

This changes the delete job API by adding
the choice to delete a job asynchronously.
The commit adds a `wait_for_completion` parameter
to the delete job request. When set to `false`,
the action returns immediately and the response
contains the task id.

This also changes the handling of subsequent
delete requests for a job that is already being
deleted. It now uses the task framework to check
if the job is being deleted instead of the cluster
state. This is a beneficial for it is going to also
be working once the job configs are moved out of the
cluster state and into an index. Also, force delete
requests that are waiting for the job to be deleted
will not proceed with the deletion if the first task
fails. This will prevent overloading the cluster. Instead,
the failure is communicated better via notifications
so that the user may retry.

Finally, this makes the `deleting` property of the job
visible (also it was renamed from `deleted`). This allows
a client to render a deleting job differently.

Closes #32836
