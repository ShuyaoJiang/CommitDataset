Initialize sequence numbers on a shrunken index

Bringing together shards in a shrunken index means that we need to
address the start of history for the shrunken index. The problem here is
that sequence numbers before the maximum of the maximum sequence numbers
on the source shards can collide in the target shards in the shrunken
index. To address this, we set the maximum sequence number and the local
checkpoint on the target shards to this maximum of the maximum sequence
numbers. This enables correct document-level semantics for documents
indexed before the shrink, and history on the shrunken index will
effectively start from here.
