SQL: Introduce HISTOGRAM grouping function (#36510)

Introduce Histogram grouping function for bucketing/grouping data based
 on a given range. Both date and numeric histograms are supported using
 the appropriate range declaration (numbers vs intervals).

SELECT HISTOGRAM(number, 50) AS h FROM index GROUP BY h
SELECT HISTOGRAM(date, INTERVAL 1 YEAR) AS h FROM index GROUP BY h

In addition add multiply operator for Intervals
Add docs for intervals and histogram
