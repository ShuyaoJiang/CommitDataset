Switch some x-pack tests to new style Requests (#32500)

In #29623 we added `Request` object flavored requests to the low level
REST client and in #30315 we deprecated the old `performRequest`s. This
changes all calls in the `x-pack/qa/audit-tests`,
`x-pack/qa/ml-disabled`, and `x-pack/qa/multi-node` projects to use the
new versions.
