Fixed a bug that prevents pipelines to load that use stored scripts after a restart.

The bug was caused because the ScriptService had no reference to a ClusterState instance,
because it received the ClusterState after the PipelineStore. This only is the case
after a restart.

A bad side effect is that during a restart, any pipeline to be loaded after the pipeline that uses a stored script,
was never loaded, which caused many pipeline to be missing in bulk / index request api calls.
