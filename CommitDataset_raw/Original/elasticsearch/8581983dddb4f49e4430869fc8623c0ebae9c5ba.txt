Add linearizability checker for coordination layer (#36943)

Checks that the core coordination algorithm implemented as part of Zen2 (#32006) supports
linearizable semantics. This commit adds a linearizability checker based on the Wing and Gong
graph search algorithm with support for compositional checking and activates these checks for all
CoordinatorTests.
