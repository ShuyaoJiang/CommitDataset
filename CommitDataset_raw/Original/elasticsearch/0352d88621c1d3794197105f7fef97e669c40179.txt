Get Mapping API to honour allow_no_indices and ignore_unavailable (#31507)

Get Mapping currently throws index not found exception (and returns
404 status code) from the REST layer whenever an index was specified
and no indices have been returned. We should not have this logic in the
REST layer though as only our index resolver should decide whether we
need to throw exceptions or not based on provided indices and corresponding
indices options.

Closes #31485
