[CCR] Add more unit tests for shard follow task (#32121)

The added tests are based on specific scenarios as described in the test plan.
Before this change the ShardFollowNodeTaskTests contained more random like tests,
but these have been removed and in a followup pr better random tests will
be added in a new test class as is described in the test plan.
