Move ML tests to be sub-projects of ML (#33026)

This commit moves the ML QA tests to be a sub-project of ML. The purpose
of this refactoring is to enable ML developers to run
:x-pack:plugin:ml:check and run the vast majority of a ML tests with a
single command (this still does not contain the ML REST tests, nor the
upgrade tests). This simplifies local development for faster iteration.
