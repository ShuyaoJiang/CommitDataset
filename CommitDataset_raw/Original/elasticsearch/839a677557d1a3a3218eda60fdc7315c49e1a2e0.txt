Do not override named S3 client credentials (#33793)

In cases when mixed secure S3 client credentials and insecure S3 client
credentials were used (that is, those defined on the repository), we
were overriding the credentials from the repository using insecure
settings to all the repositories. This commit fixes this by not mixing
up repositories that use insecure settings with those that use secure
settings.
