Test: Change randomValueOtherThan(null, supplier) (#27901)

When the first parameter of `ESTestCase#randomValueOtherThan` is `null`
then run the supplier until it returns non-`null`. Previously,
`randomValueOtherThan` just ran the supplier one time which was
confusing.

Unexpectedly, it looks like not tests rely on the original `null`
handling.

Closes #27821
