Checkstyle: Catch wide snippets (#34163)

We use wrap code in `// tag` and `//end` to include it in our docs. Our
current docs style wraps code snippets in a box that is only wide enough
for 76 characters and adds a horizontal scroll bar for wider snippets
which makes the snippet much harder to read. This adds a checkstyle check
that looks for java code that is included in the docs and is wider than
that 76 characters so all snippets fit into the box. It solves many of
the failures that this catches but suppresses many more. I will clean
those up in a follow up change.
