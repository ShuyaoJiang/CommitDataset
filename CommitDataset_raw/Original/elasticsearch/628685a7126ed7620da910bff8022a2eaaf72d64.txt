Clarify IDE versions

This commit clarifies the minimum IDE versions that we support for
development. We need to formally state that the minimum that we support
for Eclipse is Eclipse Oxygen because Eclipse Neon and prior releases
have type inference bugs that lead to compilation issues that cause us
to have to contort our code to support Eclipse and it appears that
Eclipse Oxygen is less-prone to these issue. And the recent high-level
REST shading work seems to work best in Intellij 2017.2. Therefore, we
state these versions explicitly.
