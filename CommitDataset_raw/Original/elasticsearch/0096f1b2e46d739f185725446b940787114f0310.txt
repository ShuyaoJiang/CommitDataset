Ensure changes requests return the latest mapping version (#37633)

Today we keep the mapping on the follower in sync with the leader's
using the mapping version from changes requests. There are two rare
cases where the mapping on the follower is not synced properly:

1. The returned mapping version (from ClusterService) is outdated than
the actual mapping. This happens because we expose the latest cluster
state in ClusterService after applying it to IndexService.

2. It's possible for the FollowTask to receive an outdated mapping than
the min_required_mapping. In that case, it should fetch the mapping
again; otherwise, the follower won't have the right mapping.
