[TEST] Improve ML security tests (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2417)

The changes made for elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2369 showed that the ML security tests were seriously
weakened by the decision to grant many "minimal" privileges to all users
involved in the tests.  A better solution is to override the auth header
such that a superuser runs setup actions and assertions that work by
querying raw documents in ways that an end user wouldn't.  Then the ML
endpoints can be called with the privileges provided by the ML roles and
nothing else.
