Detect mktemp from coreutils

GNU mktemp and BSD mktemp have different command line flags. On some
macOS systems users have mktemp from coreutils in their PATH overriding
the system mktemp from BSD. This commit adds detection for the coreutils
mktemp versus the BSD mktemp and uses the appropriate syntax based on
the detection.
