Restore local checkpoint tracker on promotion

When a shard is promoted to replica, it's possible that it was
previously a replica that started following a new primary. When it
started following this new primary, the state of its local checkpoint
tracker was reset. Upon promotion, it's possible that the state of the
local checkpoint tracker has not yet restored from a successful
primary-replica re-sync. To account for this, we must restore the state
of the local checkpoint tracker when a replica shard is promoted to
primary. To do this, we stream the operations in the translog, marking
the operations that are in the translog as completed. We do this before
we fill the gaps on the newly promoted primary, ensuring that we have a
primary shard with a complete history up to the largest maximum sequence
number it has ever seen.
