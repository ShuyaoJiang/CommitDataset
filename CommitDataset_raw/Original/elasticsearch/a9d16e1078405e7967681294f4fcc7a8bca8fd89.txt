Ignore waitForActiveShards when syncing leases (#39224)

Adjust the retention lease sync actions so that they do not respect the
`index.write.wait_for_active_shards` setting on an index, allowing them to sync
retention leases even if insufficiently many shards are currently active to
accept writes.
