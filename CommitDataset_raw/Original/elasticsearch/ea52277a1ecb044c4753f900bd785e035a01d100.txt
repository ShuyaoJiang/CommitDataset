HLRest: add put user API (#32332)

This commit adds a security client to the high level rest client, which
includes an implementation for the put user api. As part of these
changes, a new request and response class have been added that are
specific to the high level rest client. One change here is that the response
was previously wrapped inside a user object. The plan is to remove this
wrapping and this PR adds an unwrapped response outside of the user
object so we can remove the user object later on.

See #29827
