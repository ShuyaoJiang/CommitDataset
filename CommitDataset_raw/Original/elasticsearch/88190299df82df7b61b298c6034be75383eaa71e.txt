CCR: Fix incorrect read request completion condition (#32266)

Today we consider a read request is exhausted if from_seqno is equal to
or greater than the max_required_seqno. However, if we stop when
from_seqno equals to the max_required_seqno, we will miss an operation
whose seqno is max_required_seqno because we have not seen that 
operation yet.
