TEST: Create following engines in the main thread (#33391)

There are two races in the testUpdateAndReadChangesConcurrently if the
following engines are created in the worker threads. We fixed the
translog issue in #33352, but there is still another race with
createStore.

This commit ensures that we create all engines in the main thread.

Relates #33352
Closes #33344
