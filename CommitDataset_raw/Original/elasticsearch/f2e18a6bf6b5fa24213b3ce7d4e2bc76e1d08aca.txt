Add check for minimum required Docker version (#36497)

Our Docker build uses a multi-stage Docker build. This requires Docker
version 17.05 or greater. Without an explicit check here, the build
fails in a mysterious way such as "invalid reference format" that is
hard to track down (Google searches for "Docker invalid reference
format" do not turn up anything useful). This commit refactors our
existing Docker checks, and adds a new one for the minimum Docker
version.
