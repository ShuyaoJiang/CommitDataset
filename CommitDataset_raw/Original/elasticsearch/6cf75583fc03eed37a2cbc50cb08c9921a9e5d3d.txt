Add roles and cluster privileges for data frame transforms (#39661)

This change adds two new cluster privileges:

* manage_data_frame_transforms
* monitor_data_frame_transforms

And two new built-in roles:

* data_frame_transforms_admin
* data_frame_transforms_user

These permit access to the data frame transform endpoints.
(Index privileges are also required on the source and
destination indices for each data frame transform, but
since these indices are configurable they it is not
appropriate to grant them via built-in roles.)
