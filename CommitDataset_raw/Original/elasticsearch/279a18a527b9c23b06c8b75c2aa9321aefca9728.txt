Add parent-join module (#24638)

* Add parent-join module

This change adds a new module named `parent-join`.
The goal of this module is to provide a replacement for the `_parent` field but as a first step this change only moves the `has_child`, `has_parent` queries and the `children` aggregation to this module.
These queries and aggregations are no longer in core but they are deployed by default as a module.
