Add proxy support to RemoteClusterConnection (#33062)

This adds support for connecting to a remote cluster through
a tcp proxy. A remote cluster can configured with an additional
`search.remote.$clustername.proxy` setting. This proxy will be used
to connect to remote nodes for every node connection established.
We still try to sniff the remote clsuter and connect to nodes directly
through the proxy which has to support some kind of routing to these nodes.
Yet, this routing mechanism requires the handshake request to include some
kind of information where to route to which is not yet implemented. The effort
to use the hostname and an optional node attribute for routing is tracked
in #32517

Closes #31840
