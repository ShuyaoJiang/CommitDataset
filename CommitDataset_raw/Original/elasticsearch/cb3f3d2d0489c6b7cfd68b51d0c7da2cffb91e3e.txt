[ML] Switch from max_running_jobs to xpack.ml.max_open_jobs (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2232)

This change makes 2 improvements to the max_running_jobs setting:

1. Namespaces it by adding the xpack.ml. prefix
2. Renames "running" to "open", because the "running" terminology
   is not used elsewhere

The old max_running_jobs setting is used as a fallback if the new
xpack.ml.max_open_jobs setting is not specified.  max_running_jobs
is deprecated and (to ease backporting in the short term) will be
removed from 7.0 in a different PR closer to release of 7.0.
