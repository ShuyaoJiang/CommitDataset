SQL: Implement `CONVERT`, an alternative to `CAST` (#34660)

`CONVERT` works exactly like cast with slightly different syntax:
`CONVERT(<value>, <data_type)` as opposed to `CAST(<value> AS <data_type>)`

Moreover it support format of the MS-SQL data types `SQL_<type>`,
e.g.: `SQL_INTEGER`

Closes: #34513
