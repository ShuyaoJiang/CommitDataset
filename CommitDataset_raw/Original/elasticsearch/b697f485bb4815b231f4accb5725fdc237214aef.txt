Introduce `TransportLogger` for common logging (#32725)

Historically we have had a ESLoggingHandler in the netty module that
logs low-level connection operations. This class just extends the netty
logging handler with some (broken) message deserialization. This commit
fixes this message serialization and moves the class to server.

This new logger logs inbound and outbound messages. Eventually, we
should move other event logging to this class (connect, close, flush).
That way we will have consistent logging regards of which transport is
loaded.

Resolves #27306 on master. Older branches will need a different fix.
