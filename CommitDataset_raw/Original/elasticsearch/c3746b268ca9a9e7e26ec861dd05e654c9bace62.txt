Separate Painless Whitelist Loading from the Painless Definition (#26540)

Adds several small whitelist data structures and a new Whitelist class to separate the idea of loading a whitelist from the actual Painless Definition class. This is the first step of many in allowing users to define custom whitelists per context. Also supports the idea of loading multiple whitelists from different sources for a single context.
