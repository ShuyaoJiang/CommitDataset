[Painless] Removes extraneous compile method (#35323)

With the removal of SearchScript (#34730), an extraneous compile method 
was left behind in PainlessScriptEngine. This change removes the method and 
updates the tests that depend on it to use the main compile method which 
gives better test coverage.
