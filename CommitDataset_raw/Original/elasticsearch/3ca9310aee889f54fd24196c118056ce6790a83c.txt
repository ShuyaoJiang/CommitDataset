Update docs on vertex ordering (#27963)

At time of writing, GeoJSON did not enforce a specific ordering of vertices in
a polygon, but it now does. We occasionally get reports of Elasticsearch
rejecting apparently-valid GeoJSON because of badly oriented polygons, and it's
helpful to be able to point at this bit of the documentation when responding.
