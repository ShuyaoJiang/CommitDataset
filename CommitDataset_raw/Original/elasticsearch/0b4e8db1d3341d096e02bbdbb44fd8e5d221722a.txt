Security: don't call prepare index for reads (#34246)

The security native stores follow a pattern where
`SecurityIndexManager#prepareIndexIfNeededThenExecute` wraps most calls
made for the security index. The reasoning behind this was to check if
the security index had been upgraded to the latest version in a
consistent manner. However, this has the potential side effect that a
read will trigger the creation of the security index or an updating of
its mappings, which can lead to issues such as failures due to put
mapping requests timing out even though we might have been able to read
from the index and get the data necessary.

This change introduces a new method, `checkIndexVersionThenExecute`,
that provides the consistent checking of the security index to make
sure it has been upgraded. That is the only check that this method
performs prior to running the passed in operation, which removes the
possible triggering of index creation and mapping updates for reads.

Additionally, areas where we do reads now check the availability of the
security index and can short circuit requests. Availability in this
context means that the index exists and all primaries are active.
