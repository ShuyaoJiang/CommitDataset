_cat/indices with Security, hide names when wildcard (#38824)

This changes the output of the `_cat/indices` API with `Security` enabled.

It is possible to only display the index name (and possibly the index
health, depending on the request options) but not its stats (doc count, merges,
size, etc). This is the case for closed indices which have index metadata in the
cluster state but no associated shards, hence no shard stats.
However, when `Security` is enabled, and the request contains wildcards,
**open** indices without stats are a common occurrence. This is because the
index names in the response table are picked up directly from the cluster state
which is not filtered by `Security`'s _indexNameExpressionResolver_, unlike the
stats data which is populated by the indices stats API which does go through the
index name resolver.
This is a bug, because it is circumventing `Security`'s function to hide
unauthorized indices.

This has been fixed by displaying the index names as they are resolved by the indices
stats API. The outputs of these two APIs is now very similar: same index names,
similar data but different format.
