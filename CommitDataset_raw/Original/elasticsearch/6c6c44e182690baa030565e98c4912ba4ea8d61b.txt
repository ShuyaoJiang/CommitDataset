Replace Vagrant with Docker for idp-fixture (#39948)

The change replaces the Vagrant box based fixture with a fixture
based on docker compose and 2 docker images, one for an openldap
server and one for a Shibboleth SAML Identity Provider.

The configuration of both openldap and shibboleth is identical to
the previous one, in order to minimize required changes in the
tests
