Do not close bad indices on startup (#39500)

With #17187, we verified IndexService creation during initial state recovery on the master and if the
recovery failed the index was imported as closed, not allocating any shards. This was mainly done to
prevent endless allocation loops and full log files on data-nodes when the indexmetadata contained
broken settings / analyzers. Zen2 loads the cluster state eagerly, and this check currently runs on all
nodes (not only the elected master), which can significantly slow down startup on data nodes.
Furthermore, with replicated closed indices (#33888) on the horizon, importing the index as closed
will no longer not allocate any shards. Fortunately, the original issue for endless allocation loops is
no longer a problem due to #18467, where we limit the retries of failed allocations. The solution here
is therefore to just undo #17187, as it's no longer necessary, and covered by #18467, which will solve
the issue for Zen2 and replicated closed indices as well.
