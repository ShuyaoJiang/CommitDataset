[ML] Improve DeleteExpiredDataIT failure message (#39298)

This test failed once in a very long time with the assertion
that there is no document for the `non_existing_job` in the
state index. I could not see how that is possible and I cannot
reproduce. With this commit the failure message will reveal
some examples of the left behind docs which might shed a light
about what could go wrong.
