Handle empty input in AddStringKeyStoreCommand (#39490)

* Handle zero byte from stdin in keystore command

This change ensures that we do not make assumptions about the length
of the input that we can read from the stdin. It still consumes only
one line, as the previous implementation

* address feedback

* Allow eventual IOException to be thrown
