Move connection listener to ConnectionManager (#32956)

This is a followup to #31886. After that commit the
TransportConnectionListener had to be propogated to both the
Transport and the ConnectionManager. This commit moves that listener
to completely live in the ConnectionManager. The request and response
related methods are moved to a TransportMessageListener. That listener
continues to live in the Transport class.
