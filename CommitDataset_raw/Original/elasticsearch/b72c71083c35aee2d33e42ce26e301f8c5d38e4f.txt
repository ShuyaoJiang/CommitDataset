Cleanup IndexFieldData visibility (#25900)

Today we expose `IndexFieldDataService` outside of IndexService to do maintenance
or lookup field data in different ways. Yet, we have a streamlined way to access IndexFieldData
via `QueryShardContext` that should encapsulate all access to it. This also ensures that we control all other functionality like cache clearing etc.

This change also removes the `recycler` option from `ClearIndicesCacheRequest` this option is a no-op and should have been removed long ago.
