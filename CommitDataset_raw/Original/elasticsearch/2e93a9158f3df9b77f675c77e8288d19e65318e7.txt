Align thread pool info to thread pool configuration (#29123)

Today we report thread pool info using a common object. This means that
we use a shared set of terminology that is not consistent with the
terminology used to the configure thread pools. This holds in particular
for the minimum and maximum number of threads in the thread pool where
we use the following terminology:
 thread pool info | fixed | scaling
 min                core    size
 max                max     size

This commit changes the display of thread pool info to be dependent on
the type of the thread pool so that we can align the terminology in the
output of thread pool info with the terminology used to configure a
thread pool.
