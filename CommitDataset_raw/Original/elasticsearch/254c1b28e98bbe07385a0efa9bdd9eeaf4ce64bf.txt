[Docs] Clarify behaviour of Pattern Capture Token Filter during search (#26278)

There was some confusion about the fact that tokens emitted from a Pattern
Capture Token Filter are treated as synonyms when used to analyze a search
query. This commit adds an explanation to the note in the docs to emphasize this
behaviour.

Closes #25746
