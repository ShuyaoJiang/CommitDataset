Add get-user-privileges API (#33928)

This API is intended as a companion to the _has_privileges API.
It returns the list of privileges that are held by the current user.

This information is difficult to reason about, and consumers should
avoid making direct security decisions based solely on this data.
For example, each of the following index privileges (as well as many
more) would grant a user access to index a new document into the
"metrics-2018-08-30" index, but clients should not try and deduce
that information from this API.
- "all" on "*"
- "all" on "metrics-*"
- "write" on "metrics-2018-*"
- "write" on "metrics-2018-08-30"

Rather, if a client wished to know if a user had "index" access to
_any_ index, it would be possible to use this API to determine whether
the user has any index privileges, and on which index patterns, and
then feed those index patterns into _has_privileges in order to
determine whether the "index" privilege had been granted.

The result JSON is modelled on the Role API, with a few small changes
to reflect how privileges are modelled when multiple roles are merged
together (multiple DLS queries, multiple FLS grants, multiple global
conditions, etc).
