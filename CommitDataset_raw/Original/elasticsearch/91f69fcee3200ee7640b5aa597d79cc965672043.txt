Address failing CCR retention lease test

This test fails rarely but it is flaky in its current form. The problem
here is that we lack a guarantee on the retention leases having been
synced to all shard copies. We need to sleep long enough to ensure that
that occurs, and then we can sample the retention leases, possibly sleep
again (we usually will not have too since the first sleep will have been
long enough to allow a sync and a renewal to happen, if one was going to
happen), and the sample the retention leases for comparison.

Closes #39331
