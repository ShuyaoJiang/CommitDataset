LLRC: Make warning behavior pluggable per request (#36345)

This allows you to plug the behavior that the LLRC uses to handle
warnings on a per request basis.

We entertained the idea of allowing you to set the warnings behavior to
strict mode on a per request basis but that wouldn't allow the high
level rest client to fail when it sees an unexpected warning.

We also entertained the idea of adding a list of "required warnings" to
the `RequestOptions` but that won't work well with failures that occur
*sometimes* like those we see in mixed clusters.

Adding a list of "allowed warnings" to the `RequestOptions` would work
for mixed clusters but it'd leave many of the assertions in our tests
weaker than we'd like.

This behavior plugging implementation allows us to make a "required
warnings" option when we need it and an "allowed warnings" behavior when
we need it.

I don't think this behavior is going to be commonly used by used outside
of the Elasticsearch build, but I expect they'll be a few commendably
paranoid folks who could use this behavior.
