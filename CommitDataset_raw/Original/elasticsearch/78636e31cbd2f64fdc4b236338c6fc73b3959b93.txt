Remove TransportSingleItemBulkWriteAction as replication action (#40424)

The implementation of TransportIndexAction and TransportDeleteAction as
TransportReplicationAction existed for interoperability with older 5.x nodes, as these older nodes
coordinated single index / deletes as replication requests. This BWC layer is no longer needed in 7.x,
where these single actions are now mapped to bulk requests. Completely removing the deprecated
transport actions is not possible yet if we want to keep BWC with a 6.x transport client. The best
way here is to wait for the transport client to go away and then just remove the actions.
