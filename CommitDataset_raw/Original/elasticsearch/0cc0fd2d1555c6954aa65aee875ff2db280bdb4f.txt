Add a frozen engine implementation (#34357)

This change adds a `frozen` engine that allows lazily open a directory reader
on a read-only shard. The engine wraps general purpose searchers in a LazyDirectoryReader
that also allows to release and reset the underlying index readers after any and before
secondary search phases.
