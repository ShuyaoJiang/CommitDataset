SQL: Switch to the standard way of cursor serialization (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3197)

While working on cursor cleanup, I realized that we still have two ways to serialize the cursor and the second way doesn't contain the cursor version (only client version, that can be potentially different from the cursor version). This commit switches to the unified way of serializing the cursor.

This is a follow up for elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3064.
