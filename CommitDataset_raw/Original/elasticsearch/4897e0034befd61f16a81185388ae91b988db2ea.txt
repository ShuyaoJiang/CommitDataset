Allow overriding JVM options in Windows service (#29044)

Today we allow any other method of starting Elastisearch to override
jvm.options via ES_JAVA_OPTS. Yet, for some settings in the Windows
service, we do not allow this. This commit removes this in favor of
being consistent with other packaging choices.
