Concurrent file chunk fetching for CCR restore (#38495)

Adds the ability to fetch chunks from different files in parallel, configurable using the new `ccr.indices.recovery.max_concurrent_file_chunks` setting, which defaults to 5 in this PR.

The implementation uses the parallel file writer functionality that is also used by peer recoveries.
