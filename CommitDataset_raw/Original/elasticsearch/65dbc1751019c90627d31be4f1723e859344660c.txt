SQL: Fix bug caused by empty composites (#30343)

When dealing with filtering, a composite aggregation might return empty
buckets (which have been filtered) which gets sent as is to the client.
Unfortunately this interprets the response as no more data instead of
retrying.

This now has changed and the listener keeps retrying until either the
query has ended or data passes the filter.
