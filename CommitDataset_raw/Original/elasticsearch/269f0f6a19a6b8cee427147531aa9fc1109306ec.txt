[ML] Default model memory limit to 1GB for newly created jobs (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2300)

This change means that newly created jobs will get an explicit 1GB
model memory limit if no model memory limit is specified when creating
the job.  Existing jobs that had a null model memory limit will carry
on using the default model memory limit defined in the C++ code.
