[Rollup] Disallow index patterns that match the rollup index (#30491)

We should not allow the user to configure index patterns that also match
the index which stores the rollup index.

For example, it is quite natural for a user to specify `metricbeat-*`
as the index pattern, and then store the rollups in `metricbeat-rolled`.
This will start throwing errors as soon as the rollup index is created
because the indexer will try to search it.

Note: this does not prevent the user from matching against existing
rollup indices.  That should be prevented by the field-level validation
during job creation.
