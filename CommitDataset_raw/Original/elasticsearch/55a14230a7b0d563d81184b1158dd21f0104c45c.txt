Do not keep 5.x commits once having 6.x commits (#28188)

Currently we keep a 5.x index commit as a safe commit until we have a
6.x safe commit. During that time, if peer-recovery happens, a primary
will send a 5.x commit in file-based sync and the recovery will even
fail as the snapshotted commit does not have sequence number tags.

This commit updates the combined deletion policy to delete legacy
commits if there are 6.x commits.
