Query range fields by doc values when they are expected to be more efficient than points.

* Enable doc values for range fields by default.
* Store ranges in a binary format that support multi field fields.
* Added BinaryDocValuesRangeQuery that can query ranges that have been encoded into a binary doc values field.
* Wrap range queries on a range field in IndexOrDocValuesQuery query.

Closes #24314
