Increase time to wait for green in rolling upgrade tests (#26781)

This commit increases the amount of time to wait for green to accound for unassigned shards that
have been delayed. The default delay is 60s, so we need to wait longer than that. Previously, the
wait would timeout at 30s due to the rest client and the default for the cluster health api.

Closes #26742
