Introduce http and tcp server channels (#31446)

Historically in TcpTransport server channels were represented by the
same channel interface as socket channels. This was necessary as
TcpTransport was parameterized by the channel type. This commit
introduces TcpServerChannel and HttpServerChannel classes. Additionally,
it adds the implementations for the various transports. This allows
server channels to have unique functionality and not implement the
methods they do not support (such as send and getRemoteAddress).

Additionally, with the introduction of HttpServerChannel this commit
extracts some of the storing and closing channel work to the abstract
http server transport.
