[ML] Uplift model memory limit on job migration (#37126)

When a 6.1-6.3 job is opened in a later version
we increase the model memory limit by 30% if it's
below 0.5GB. The migration of jobs from cluster
state to the config index changes the job version,
so we need to also do this uplift as part of that
config migration.
