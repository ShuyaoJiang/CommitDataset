Ignore the `-snapshot` suffix when comparing the Lucene version in the build and the docs. (#27927)

Currently if the Lucene version is `X.Y.Z-snapshot-{gitrev}`, then we will
expect the docs to have `X.Y.Z-snapshot` as a Lucene version. I would like
to change it to `X.Y.Z` so that this doesn't need changing when we move from a
snapshot to a final release.
