Add releaseTest option to CI script (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2482)

This option runs a normal check but with `-Dsnapshot=false` (the flag
used to indicate a release build).

Related to https://github.com/elastic/infra/issues/2759 and
https://github.com/elastic/infra/issues/2739 from the ES side.
