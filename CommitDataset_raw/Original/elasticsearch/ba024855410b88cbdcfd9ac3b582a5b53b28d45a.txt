Make sure SortBuilders rewrite inner nested sorts (#26532)

The three SortBuilders that can have inner NestedSortBuilders currently don't
rewrite any of the filters contained in them. This change adds a rewrite method
to NestedSortBuilder and changes rewriting in FieldSortBuilder,
ScriptSortBuilder and GeoDistanceSortBuilder to make sure inner nested sorts get
rewritten if they need to.
