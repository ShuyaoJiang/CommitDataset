add `index.lifecycle.date` setting (#3545)

This PR adds a new setting called `index.lifecycle.date` that 
the ShrinkAction will be responsible for populating in the newly created index.

This way, we can continue to know when we should be executing the next phase
relative to the original index creation date, and not that of the shrunken index.
