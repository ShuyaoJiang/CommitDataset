Remove S3 output stream (#27280)

Now the blob size information is available before writing anything, 
the repository implementation can know upfront what will be the 
more suitable API to upload the blob to S3.

This commit removes the DefaultS3OutputStream and S3OutputStream 
classes and moves the implementation of the upload logic directly in the 
S3BlobContainer.
