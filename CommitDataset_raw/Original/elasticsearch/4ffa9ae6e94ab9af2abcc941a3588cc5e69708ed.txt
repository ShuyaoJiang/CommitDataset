Reduce global checkpoint sync interval in disruption tests (#38931)

We verify seq_no_stats is aligned between copies at the end of some
disruption tests. Sometimes, the assertion `assertSeqNos` is tripped due
to a lagged global checkpoint on replicas. The global checkpoint on
replicas is lagged because we sync the global checkpoint 30 seconds (by
default) after the last replication operation. This change reduces the
global checkpoint sync-internal to 1s in the disruption tests.
