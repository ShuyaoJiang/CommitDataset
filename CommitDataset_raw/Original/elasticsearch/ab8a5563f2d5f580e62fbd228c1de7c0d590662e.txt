Logging: Drop remaining Settings log ctor (#34149)

Drops the last logging constructor that takes `Settings` because it is
no longer needed.

Watcher goes through a lot of effort to pass `Settings` to `Logger`
constructors and dropping `Settings` from all of those calls allowed us
to remove quite a bit of log-based ceremony from watcher.
