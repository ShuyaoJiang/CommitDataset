Internal: Add versionless alias for rest client codebase in policy files (#26521)

Security manager policy files contains grants for specific codebases,
where a codebase is a jar file. We use a system property containing the
name of the jar file to resolve the jar file location when parsing the
policy file. However, this means the version of the jars must be
modified when versions of dependencies change. This is particularly
messy for elasticsearch, where we now have a dependency on the rest
client, and need to support both a snapshot version for testing and non
snapshot for release.

This commit adds an alias for the elasticsearch rest client without a
version to be used in policy files. That allows the policy files to not care whether
the rest client is a snapshot or release.
