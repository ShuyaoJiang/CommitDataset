Allow update of `eager_global_ordinals` on `_parent`. (#28014)

A bug introduced in #24407 currently prevents `eager_global_ordinals` from
being updated. This new approach should fix the issue while still allowing
mapping updates to not specify the `_parent` field if it doesn't need
updating, which was the goal of #24407.
