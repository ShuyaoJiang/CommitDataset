Get Aliases with wildcard exclusion expression (#34230)

This commit adds the code in the HTTP layer that will parse exclusion wildcard
expressions.
The existing code issues 404s for wildcards as well as explicit indices.
But, in general, in an expression with exclude wildcards (-...*) following other
include wildcards, there is no way to tell if the include wildcard produced no
results or they were subsequently excluded.
Therefore, the proposed change is breaking the behavior of 404s for
wildcards. Specifically, no 404s will be returned for wildcards, even
if they are not followed by exclude wildcards or the exclude wildcards
could not possibly exclude what has previously been included.
Only explicitly requested aliases will be called out as missing.
