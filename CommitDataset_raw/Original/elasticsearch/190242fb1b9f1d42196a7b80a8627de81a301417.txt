Test: add setting to change request timeout for rest client (#25201)

This commit adds a setting to change the request timeout for the rest client. This is useful as the
default timeout is 30s, which is also the same default for calls like cluster health. If both are
the same then the response from the cluster health api will not be received as the client usually
times out first making test failures harder to debug.
