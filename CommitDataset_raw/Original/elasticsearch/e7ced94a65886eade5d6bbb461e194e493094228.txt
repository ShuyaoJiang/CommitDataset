NETWORKING: Add SSL Handler before other Handlers (#34636)

* NETWORKING: Add SSL Handler before other Handlers

* The only way to run into the issue in #33998 is for `Netty4MessageChannelHandler`
to be in the pipeline while the SslHandler is not. Adding the SslHandler before any
other handlers should ensure correct ordering here even when we handle upstream events
in our own thread pool
* Ensure that channels that were closed concurrently don't trip the assertion
* Closes #33998
