Introduce elasticsearch-env

This commit introduces the elasticsearch-env script. The purpose of this
script is threefold:
 - vastly simplify the various scripts used in Elasticsearch
 - provide a script that can be included in other scripts in the
   Elasticsearch ecosystem (e.g., plugins)
 - correctly establish the environment for all scripts (e.g., so that
   users can run `elasticsearch-keystore` from a package distribution
   without having to worry about setting `CONF_DIR` first, otherwise the
   keystore would be created in the wrong location)

Relates #25815
