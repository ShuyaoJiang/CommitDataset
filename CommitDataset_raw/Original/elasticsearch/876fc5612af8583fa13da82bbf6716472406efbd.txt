[Monitoring] Use index.auto_expand_replicas: 0-1 (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3282)

This changes the default behavior of .monitoring indices to be green on one-node clusters, instead of constantly yellow.

Note: This only impacts .monitoring* indices. Watcher indices currently still require a replica.
