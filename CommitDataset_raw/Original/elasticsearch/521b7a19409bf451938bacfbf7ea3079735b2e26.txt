Watcher: Support setting of markdown in attachments

This allows to set the `mrkdwn_in` array in slack attachments to specify which fields should contain markdown.
See https://api.slack.com/docs/message-formatting#message_formatting

This is mainly useful for the text and pretext fields in an attachment.
