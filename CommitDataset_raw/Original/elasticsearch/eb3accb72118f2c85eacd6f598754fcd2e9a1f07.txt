Security: move User to protocol project (#32367)

The User class has been moved to the protocol project for upcoming work
to add more security APIs to the high level rest client. As part of
this change, the toString method no longer uses a custom output method
from MetadataUtils and instead just relies on Java's toString
implementation.
