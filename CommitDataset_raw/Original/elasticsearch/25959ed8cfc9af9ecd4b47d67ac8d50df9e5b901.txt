[Security] Include an empty json object in an json array when FLS filters out all fields (#30709)

Prior to this change an json array element with no fields would be omitted from json array.
Nested inner hits source filtering relies on the fact that the json array element numbering
remains untouched and this causes AOOB exceptions in the ES side during the fetch phase
without this change.

Closes #30624
