Configure heap dump path for archive packages (#29130)

This is a follow up to a previous change which set the heap dump path
for the package distributions. The observation here is that we always
set the working directory of Elasticsearch to to the root of
installation (i.e., Elasticsearch home). Therefore, we can specify the
heap dump path relative to this directory and default it to the data
directory, similar to the package distributions.
