Watcher: Ensure correct method is used to read secure settings (#31753)

As SecureSetting is extended from Setting, you can easily accidentally
use `SecureSetting.simpleString()` to read a secure setting instead of
`SecureSetting.secureString()`. This commit changes this behaviour in
some watcher notification services.
