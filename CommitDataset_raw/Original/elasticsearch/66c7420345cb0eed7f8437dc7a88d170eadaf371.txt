Rename integTest to bwcTestSample for bwc test projects (#38433)

* Rename integTest to bwcTestSample for bwc test projects

This change renames the `integTest` task to `bwcTestSample` for projects
testing bwc to make it possible to run all the bwc tests that check
would run without running on bwc tests.

This change makes it possible to add a new PR check on backports to make
sure these don't break BWC tests in master.

* Rename task as per PR
