Suppress hdfsFixture if there are spaces in the path (#30302)

HDFS sets its thread-name format based partly on a URL-encoded version of the
path, but the URL-encoding of spaces as `%20` is interpreted as a field in the
formatted string of type `2`, which is nonsensical. This change simply skips 
these tests in this case.
