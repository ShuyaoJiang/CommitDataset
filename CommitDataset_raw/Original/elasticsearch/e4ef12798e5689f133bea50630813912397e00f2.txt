Add PeerFinder#onFoundPeersUpdated (#32939)

Today the PeerFinder silently updates the set of found peers as new peers are
discovered and old ones are disconnected, and elections are scheduled
independently of these changes. In fact, it would be better if the election
scheduler were only activated on discovery of a quorum of peers. This commit
introduces the `onFoundPeersUpdated` method that allows this flow.
