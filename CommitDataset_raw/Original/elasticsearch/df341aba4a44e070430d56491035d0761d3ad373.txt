[ILM] make IndexLifecycleExplainResponse more resilient to null values (#35800)

added validation for complete information of step details.

also changed the rendering of explain responses so null strings are not rendered

Another thing that I changed is the format of the client-side response. I found it difficult to maintain the two subtly-different objects, so I migrated the usage of long for the fields, to Long (just as it is on the server-side).
