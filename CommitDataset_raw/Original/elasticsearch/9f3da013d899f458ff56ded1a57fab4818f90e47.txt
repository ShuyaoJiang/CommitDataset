Date/Time parsing: Use java time API instead of exception handling (#37222)

* Add benchmark

* Use java time API instead of exception handling

when several formatters are used, the existing way of parsing those is
to throw an exception catch it, and try the next one. This is is
considerably slower than the approach taken in joda time, so that
indexing is reduced when a date format like `x||y` is used and y is the
date format being used.

This commit now uses the java API to parse the date by appending the
date time formatters to each other and does not rely on exception
handling.

* fix benchmark

* fix tests by changing formatter, also expose printer

* restore optional printing logic to fix tests

* fix tests

* incorporate review comments
