Mark shutdown non-master nodes test as awaits fix

This commit marks a failing test as awaits fix. The test is failing due
to a primary shard not knowing its own local checkpoint in the global
checkpoint tracker after recovery. If such a shard becomes primary after
promotion, and is then subsequently relocated, it can lead to a
violation of an assertion that when the primary context is transferred
the knowledge of all in-sync local checkpoints is consistent with the
global checkpoint on the relocation target.
