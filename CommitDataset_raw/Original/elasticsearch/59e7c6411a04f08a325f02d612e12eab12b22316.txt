Core: Combine messageRecieved methods in TransportRequestHandler (#31519)

TransportRequestHandler currently contains 2 messageReceived methods,
one which takes a Task, and one that does not. The first just delegates
to the second. This commit changes all existing implementors of
TransportRequestHandler to implement the version which takes Task, thus
allowing the class to be a functional interface, and eliminating the
need to throw exceptions when a task needs to be ensured.
