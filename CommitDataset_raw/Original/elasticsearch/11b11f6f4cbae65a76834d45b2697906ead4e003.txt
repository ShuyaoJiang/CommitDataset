Share common readFrom/writeTo code in AcknowledgeResponse (#30983)

The majority of Responses inheriting from AcknowledgeResponse implement
the readFrom and writeTo serialization method in the same way. Moving this
as a default into AcknowledgeResponse and letting the few exceptions that
need a slightly different implementation handle this themselves saves a lot
of duplication.
