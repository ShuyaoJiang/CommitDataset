Allow only a fixed-size receive predictor (#26165)

With this commit we simplify our network layer by only allowing to define a
fixed receive predictor size instead of a minimum and maximum value. This also
means that the following (previously undocumented) settings are removed:

* http.netty.receive_predictor_min
* http.netty.receive_predictor_max

Using an adaptive sizing policy in the receive predictor is a very low-level
optimization. The implications on allocation behavior are extremely hard to grasp
(see our previous work in #23185) and adaptive sizing does not provide a lot of
benefits (see benchmarks in #26165 for more details).
