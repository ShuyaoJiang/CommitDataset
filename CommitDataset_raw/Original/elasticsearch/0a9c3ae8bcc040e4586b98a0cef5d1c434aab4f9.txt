Remove UpdateSettingsTestHelper class (#32557)

* Remove UpdateSettingsTestHelper class

By making the `settings()` method public on `UpdateSettingsRequest` (I think it
should have been in the first place) we can get rid of this class entirely. Mock
response objects are now constructed by parsing JSON without making the
constructor public.

Relates to #29823
