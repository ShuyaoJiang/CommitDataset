Handle case where the hole vertex is south of the containing polygon(s) (#27685)

Normally the hole is assigned to the component of the first edge to the south
of one of its vertices, but if the chosen hole vertex is south of everything
then the binary search returns -1 yielding an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
Instead, assign the vertex to the component of the first edge to its north.
Subsequent validation catches the fact that the hole is outside its component.

Fixes #25933
