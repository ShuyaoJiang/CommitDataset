Refresh at end of concurrent relocate test

We have to do something to force the global checkpoint to be
synchronized to the replicas or the assertions at the end of the test
that they are in sync will trip. Since the last write operation to hit a
replica shard will only carry the penultimate global checkpoint (it will
advance when the replicas respond with their local checkpoint), and a
background sync will not happen until the primary shard falls idle, we
force a sync through a refresh action.
