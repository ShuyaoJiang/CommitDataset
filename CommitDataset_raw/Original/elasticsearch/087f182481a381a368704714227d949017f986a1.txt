Translog file recovery should not rely on lucene commits (#25005)

When we open a translog, we rely on the `translog.ckp` file to tell us what the maximum generation file should be and on the information stored in the last lucene commit to know the first file we need to recover. This requires coordination and is currently subject to a race condition: if a node dies after a lucene commit is made but before we remove the translog generations that were unneeded by it, the next time we open the translog we will ignore those files and never delete them (I have added tests for this).

This PR changes the approach to have the translog store both of those numbers in the `translog.ckp`. This means it's more self contained and easier to control. 

This change also decouples the translog recovery logic from the specific commit we're opening. This prepares the ground to fully utilize the deletion policy introduced in #24950 and store more translog data that's needed for Lucene, keep multiple lucene commits around and be free to recover from any of them.
