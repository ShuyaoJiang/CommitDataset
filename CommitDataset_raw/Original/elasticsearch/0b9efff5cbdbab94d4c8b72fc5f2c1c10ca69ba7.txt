Zen2: Persist cluster states the old way on non-master-eligible nodes (#36247)

The shard deletion logic (triggered by IndicesStore), which also leads to index metadata deletion on
non-master-eligible data nodes, currently races against the new cluster state persistence logic
triggered by accepting cluster states. One thread is writing the index metadata while another one is
deleting the index metadata, leading to exceptions and assertions tripping (see below). The solution
proposed by this PR is to move the cluster state persistence of non-master-eligible nodes back to
the cluster applier service, just as it used to be for Zen1. This ensures that the index metadata
deletion logic, which is triggered by the shard deletion logic, runs on the same thread on which we
persist the cluster state.
