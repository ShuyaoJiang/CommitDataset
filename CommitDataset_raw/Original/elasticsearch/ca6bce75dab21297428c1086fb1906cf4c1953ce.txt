Refactor bootstrap check results and error messages

This commit refactors the bootstrap checks into a single result object
that encapsulates whether or not the check passed, and a failure message
if the check failed. This simpifies the checks, and enables the messages
to more easily be based on the state used to discern whether or not the
check passed.

Relates #26637
