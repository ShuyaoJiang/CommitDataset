Fix Deadlock from Thread.suspend in Test (#39261)

* The lambda invoked by the `lockedExecutor` eventually gets JITed (which runs a static initializer that we will suspend in with a very tiny chance).
   * Fixed by creating the `Runnable` in the main test thread and using the same instance in all threads
* Closes #35686
