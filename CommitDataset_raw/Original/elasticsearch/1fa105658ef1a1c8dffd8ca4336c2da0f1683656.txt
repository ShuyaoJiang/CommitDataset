Add CcrRestoreSourceService to track sessions (#36578)

This commit is related to #36127. It adds a CcrRestoreSourceService to
track Engine.IndexCommitRef need for in-process file restores. When a
follower starts restoring a shard through the CcrRepository it opens a
session with the leader through the PutCcrRestoreSessionAction. The
leader responds to the request by telling the follower what files it
needs to fetch for a restore. This is not yet implemented.

Once, the restore is complete, the follower closes the session with the
DeleteCcrRestoreSessionAction action.
