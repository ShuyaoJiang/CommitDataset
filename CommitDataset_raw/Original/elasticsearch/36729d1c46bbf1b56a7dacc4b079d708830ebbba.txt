Add the ability to bundle multiple plugins into a meta plugin (#28022)

This commit adds the ability to package multiple plugins in a single zip.
The zip file for a meta plugin must contains the following structure:

|____elasticsearch/
| |____   <plugin1> <-- The plugin files for plugin1 (the content of the elastisearch directory)
| |____   <plugin2>  <-- The plugin files for plugin2
| |____   meta-plugin-descriptor.properties <-- example contents below
The meta plugin properties descriptor is mandatory and must contain the following properties:

description: simple summary of the meta plugin.
name: the meta plugin name
The installation process installs each plugin in a sub-folder inside the meta plugin directory.
The example above would create the following structure in the plugins directory:

|_____ plugins
| |____   <name_of_the_meta_plugin>
| | |____   meta-plugin-descriptor.properties
| | |____   <plugin1>
| | |____   <plugin2>
If the sub plugins contain a config or a bin directory, they are copied in a sub folder inside the meta plugin config/bin directory.

|_____ config
| |____   <name_of_the_meta_plugin>
| | |____   <plugin1>
| | |____   <plugin2>

|_____ bin
| |____   <name_of_the_meta_plugin>
| | |____   <plugin1>
| | |____   <plugin2>
The sub-plugins are loaded at startup like normal plugins with the same restrictions; they have a separate class loader and a sub-plugin
cannot have the same name than another plugin (or a sub-plugin inside another meta plugin).

It is also not possible to remove a sub-plugin inside a meta plugin, only full removal of the meta plugin is allowed.
