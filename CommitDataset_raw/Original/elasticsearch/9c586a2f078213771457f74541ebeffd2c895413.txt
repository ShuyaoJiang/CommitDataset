Do not log warn shard not-available exception in replication (#30205)

Since #28049, only fully initialized shards are received write requests.
This enhancement allows us to handle all exceptions. In #28571, we
started strictly handling shard-not-available exceptions and tried to
keep the way we report replication errors to users by only reporting if
the error is not shard-not-available exceptions. However, since then we
unintentionally always log warn for all exception. This change restores
to the previous behavior which logs warn only if an exception is not a
shard-not-available exception.
