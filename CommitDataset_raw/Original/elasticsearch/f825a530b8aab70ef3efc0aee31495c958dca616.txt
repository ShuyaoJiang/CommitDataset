Limit the number of concurrent requests per node (#31206)

With `max_concurrent_shard_requests` we used to throttle / limit
the number of concurrent shard requests a high level search request
can execute per node. This had several problems since it limited the
number on a global level based on the number of nodes. This change
now throttles the number of concurrent requests per node while still
allowing concurrency across multiple nodes.

Closes #31192
