Search: Validate script query is run with a single script (#29304)

The parsing code for script query currently silently skips by any tokens
it does not know about within its parsing loop. The only token it does
not catch is an array, which means pasing multiple scripts in via an
array will cause the last script to be parsed and one, silently dropping
the others. This commit adds validation that arrays are not seen while
parsing.
