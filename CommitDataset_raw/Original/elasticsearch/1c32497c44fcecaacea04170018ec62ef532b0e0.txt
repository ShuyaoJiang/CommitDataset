Date: Add DateFormatters class that uses java.time (#31856)

A newly added class called DateFormatters now contains java.time based
builders for dates, which also intends to be fully backwards compatible,
when the name based date formatters are picked. Also a new class named 
CompoundDateTimeFormatter for being able to parse multiple different 
formats has been added.

A duelling test class has been added that ensures the same dates when
parsing java or joda time formatted dates for the name based dates.

Note, that java.time and joda time are not fully backwards compatible,
which also means that old formats will currently not work with this
setup.
