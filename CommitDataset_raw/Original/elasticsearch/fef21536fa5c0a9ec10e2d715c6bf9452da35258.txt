Bundle java in distributions (#38013)

* Bundle java in distributions

Setting up a jdk is currently a required external step when installing
elasticsearch. This is particularly problematic for the rpm/deb packages
as installing a jdk in the same package installation command does not
guarantee any order, so must be done in separate steps. Additionally,
JAVA_HOME must be set and often causes problems in selecting a correct
jdk when, for example, the system java is an older unsupported version.

This commit bundles platform specific openjdks into each distribution.
In addition to eliminating the issues above, it also presents future
possible improvements like using jlink to build jdk images only
containing modules that elasticsearch uses.
