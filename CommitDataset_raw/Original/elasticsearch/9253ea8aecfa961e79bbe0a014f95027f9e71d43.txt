Fix beidermorse phonetic token filter for unspecified `languageset` (#27112)

Currently, when we create a BeiderMorseFilter with an unspecified `languageset`,
the filter will not guess the language, which should be the default behaviour.
This change fixes this and adds a simple test for the cases with and without
provided `languageset` settings.

Closes #26771
