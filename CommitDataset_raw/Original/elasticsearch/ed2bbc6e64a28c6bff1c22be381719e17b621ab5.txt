Delay path expansion on Windows

There is a bug in the for statement where we execute the JVM options
parser. The bug manfiests in the handling of paths with ) in the
name. The problem is this: we use a for statement to capture the output
of the JVM options parser. A for statement that executes a command
defers execution to cmd. There is this gem from the help:

  1.  If all of the following conditions are met, then quote characters
      on the command line are preserved:

      - no /S switch
      - exactly two quote characters
      - no special characters between the two quote characters,
        where special is one of: &<>()@^|
      - there are one or more whitespace characters between the
        two quote characters
      - the string between the two quote characters is the name
        of an executable file.

  2.  Otherwise, old behavior is to see if the first character is
      a quote character and if so, strip the leading character and
      remove the last quote character on the command line, preserving
      any text after the last quote character.

This means that the ) causes the quotes to be stripped which ruins
everything. This commit fixes this by delaying expansion of the paths.
