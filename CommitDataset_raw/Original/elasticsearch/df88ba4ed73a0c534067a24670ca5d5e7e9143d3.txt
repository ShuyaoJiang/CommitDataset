[Rollup] Don't persist state if aborting

`doSaveState` can be invoked on different types of failure.  Some of
these failures are recoverable (e.g. search exception) which just cause
the job to reset until the next trigger time.  Other exceptions might
be caused by an Abort request.

Previously `doSaveState` assumed that the indexer state would be
INDEXING, STOPPED or STARTED and asserted that.  But if we are ABORTING
it failed the assertion, and in production would try to persist
that aborting state which is not needed (and may complicate matters later).

This commit removes the assertion and only tries to persist if we
are not aborting.  If we're aborting, we just invoke the next handler
which is likely an onFailure handler.
