Make Geo Context Mapping Parsing More Strict (#32821)

Currently, if geo context is represented by something other than
geo_point or an object with lat and lon fields, the parsing of it
as a geo context can result in ignoring the context altogether,
returning confusing errors such as number_format_exception or trying
to parse the number specifying as long-encoded hash code. It would also
fail if the geo_point was stored.

This commit makes the mapping parsing more strict and will fail during
mapping update or index creation if the geo context doesn't point to
a geo_point field.

Supersedes #32412

Closes #32202
