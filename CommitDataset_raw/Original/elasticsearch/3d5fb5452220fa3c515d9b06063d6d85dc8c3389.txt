Watcher: Create templates on nodes newer than the master (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2950)

This problem was introduced due to distributed watch execution.

When a node newer than the master node joins the cluster and gets a
.watches shard assigned it is supposed to start watcher. However
when a new version of the watch history template is part of that new
node (and we might increase that version anytime), this template does
not get installed, because only the master node is updating watcher
templates.

This commit checks if the local node version is higher than the master
node version and then also puts missing templates.

Currently this is done for all watcher templates, not only the watcher history.
