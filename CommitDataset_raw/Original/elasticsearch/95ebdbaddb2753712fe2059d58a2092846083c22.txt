Add BWC packaging distributions

Some packaging tests depend on snapshot versions of packaging
distributions yet the build does not use a repository that includes such
distributions. While we could add such a repository, a better strategy
is to follow our approach for other BWC tests where we depend on a
locally-compiled archive distribution. This commit adds a local
compilation of packaging artifacts and substitutes these anywhere that
we would otherwise depend on a snapshot of these artifacts.
