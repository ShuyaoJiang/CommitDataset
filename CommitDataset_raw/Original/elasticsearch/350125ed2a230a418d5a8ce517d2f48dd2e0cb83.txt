Improves snapshot logging and snapshoth deletion error handling (#25264)

This commit does two things:
  1. Adds logging at the DEBUG level for when the index-N blob is
  updated.
  2. When attempting to delete a snapshot, if the snapshot was not found
  in the repository data, an exception is now thrown instead of silently
  ignoring the lack of presence of the snapshot in the repository data.
