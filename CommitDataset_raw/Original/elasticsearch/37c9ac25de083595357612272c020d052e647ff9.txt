Build: allow the amount of time we wait for a node to be configured (#28403)

This commit allows for configuration of the amount of time we wait for a node to startup. This is needed as some QA tests with plugins and tribe timeout when starting the tribe
node. Even regular node startup time with plugins is starting to approach the limit of 30 seconds.

Additionally, this commit provides better feedback when a wait has failed. The code checks to
ensure all expected files exist for each node; if they do not then we consider the wait task as
having failed. Prior to this change, when there was one or more missing file the build would
continue and attempt to execute the wait condition that typically makes an HTTP request to the
cluster. The output of this type of failure does include which files exist and which do not but
this change makes it clearer that the actual HTTP call did not time out, but the failure was before
the call was even made.
