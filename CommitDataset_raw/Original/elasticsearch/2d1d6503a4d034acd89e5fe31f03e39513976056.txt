Remove BytesRef usage from XContentParser and its subclasses (#28792)

* Remove BytesRef usage from XContentParser and its subclasses

This removes all the BytesRef usage from XContentParser in favor of directly
returning a CharBuffer (this was originally what was returned, it was just
immediately wraped in a BytesRef).

Relates to #28504

* Rename method after Ryan's feedback
