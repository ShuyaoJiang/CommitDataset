Core: Don't rely on java time for epoch seconds formatting (#34086)

In order to be compatible with joda time, this adds an epoch seconds
formatter, that is able to parse floating point values.

However joda time discards the floating point values, but still parses
the data, where as this one is able to parse the whole value including
milliseconds.
