Use IndexWriter.getFlushingBytes() rather than tracking it ourselves (#33582)

Currently we keep track of how many bytes are currently being written to disk
in an AtomicLong within InternalEngine, updating it on refresh. The IndexWriter
has its own accounting for this, and exposes it via a getFlushingBytes method
in the latest lucene 8 snapshot. This commit removes the InternalEngine tracking
in favour of just using the IndexWriter method.
