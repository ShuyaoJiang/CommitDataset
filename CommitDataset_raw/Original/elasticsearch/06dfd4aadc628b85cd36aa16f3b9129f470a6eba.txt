[TEST] fix flaky ILM tests (#36612)

* WaitForRolloverReadyStepTests#mutateInstance sometimes did not mutate the instance
  correctly
* 40_explain_lifecycle#"Test new phase still has phase_time" is not really a necessary
  integration test. In addition to this, it is flaky due to the asynchronous nature of
  ILM metadata population
