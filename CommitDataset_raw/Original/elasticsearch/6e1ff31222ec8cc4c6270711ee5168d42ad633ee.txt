[CCR] AutoFollowCoordinator should tolerate that auto follow patterns may be removed (#35945)

AutoFollowCoordinator should take into account that after auto following
an index and while updating that a leader index has been followed, that
the auto follow pattern may have been removed via delete auto follow patterns
api.

Also fixed a bug that when a remote cluster connection has been removed,
the auto follow coordinator does not die when it tries get a remote client for 
that cluster.

Closes #35480
