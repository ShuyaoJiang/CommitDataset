Notify affixMap settings when any under the registered prefix matches (#28317)

* Notify affixMap settings when any under the registered prefix matches

Previously if an affixMap setting was registered, and then a completely
different setting was applied, the affixMap update consumer would be notified
with an empty map. This caused settings that were previously set to be unset in
local state in a consumer that assumed it would only be called when the affixMap
setting was changed.

This commit changes the behavior so if a prefix `foo.` is registered, any
setting under the prefix will have the update consumer notified if there are
changes starting with `foo.`.

Resolves #28316

* Add unit test

* Address feedback
