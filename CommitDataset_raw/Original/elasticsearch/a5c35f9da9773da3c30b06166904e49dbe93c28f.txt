Fix HistoryIntegrationTests timestamp comparsion (#38505)

When the millisecond part of a timestamp is 0 the toString
representation in java-time is omitting the millisecond part (joda was
not). The Search response is returning timestamps formatted with
WatcherDateTimeUtils, therefore comparisons of strings should be done
with the same formatter
