SQL: Fail on trailing test specs (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2836)

If you wrote a test at the end of one of SQL's test spec files that was
just a name without a body then the parser would throw the test away.
Now it fails to intiaize the class with an error message telling you
which file is broken.
