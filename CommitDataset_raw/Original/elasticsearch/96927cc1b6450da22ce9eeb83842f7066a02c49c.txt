[ML] Handle failures in the idiomatic way (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1785)

This commit changes a couple of places where our ExceptionsHelper
class was throwing exceptions to instead return the exceptions.
Then they can be passed to onFailure() methods or thrown depending
on what's appropriate for the caller.  This is the standard Elastic
way of handling failures.
