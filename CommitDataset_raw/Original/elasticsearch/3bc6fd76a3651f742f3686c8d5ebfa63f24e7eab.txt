Allow license installation in dev mode without TLS (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4155)

This commit allows license installation without TLS being enabled when
the cluster is in dev mode. The main difference this change enables is
the ability to install a production license on a single node cluster
that is bound to localhost and does not have the single-node discovery
enabled.
