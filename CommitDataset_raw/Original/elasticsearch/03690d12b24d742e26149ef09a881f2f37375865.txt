Remove TLS 1.0 as a default SSL protocol (#37512)

The default value for ssl.supported_protocols no longer includes TLSv1
as this is an old protocol with known security issues.
Administrators can enable TLSv1.0 support by configuring the
appropriate `ssl.supported_protocols` setting, for example:

xpack.security.http.ssl.supported_protocols: ["TLSv1.2","TLSv1.1","TLSv1"]
