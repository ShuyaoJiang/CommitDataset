Docs: HighLevelRestClient#multiSearch (#29144)

Adds docs for `HighLevelRestClient#multiSearch`. Unlike the `multiGet`
docs these are much more sparse because multi-search doesn't support
setting many options on the `MultiSearchRequest` and instead just wraps
a list of `SearchRequest`s.

Closes #28389
