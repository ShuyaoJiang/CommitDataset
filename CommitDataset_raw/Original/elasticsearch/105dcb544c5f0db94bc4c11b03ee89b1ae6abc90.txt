Enable selecting adaptive selection stats

The node stats API enables filtlering the top-level stats for only
desired top-level stats. Yet, this was never enabled for adaptive
replica selection stats. This commit enables this. We also add setting
these stats on the request builder, and fix an inconsistent name in a
setter.
