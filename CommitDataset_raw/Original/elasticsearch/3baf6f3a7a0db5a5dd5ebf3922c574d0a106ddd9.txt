Remove production from the message about license installation without TLS (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3666)

This change simply changes the wording of the message that is returned to the user when
installation of a license is attempted with security enabled and TLS disabled. The term
"production" has been removed as it means something different to users.

See elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2636
