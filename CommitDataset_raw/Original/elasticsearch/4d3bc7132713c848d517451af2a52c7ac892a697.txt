Test: randomly assign the superuser role in RunAsIntegTests

This commit updates the RunAsIntegTests to randomly assign the superuser role to the user that
is authenticating with the cluster but the request is being run as a different user. This provides
additional validation that the authorization errors are actually coming from the user the request
is running as and not due to the authenticating user's privileges.
