Strengthen FilterRoutingTests (#33149)

Today the FilterRoutingTests take the belt-and-braces approach of excluding
some node attribute values and including some others. This means that we don't
really test that both inclusion and exclusion work correctly: as long as one of
them works as expected then the test will pass. This change improves these
tests by only using one approach at once, demonstrating that both do indeed
work, and adds tests for various other scenarios too.
