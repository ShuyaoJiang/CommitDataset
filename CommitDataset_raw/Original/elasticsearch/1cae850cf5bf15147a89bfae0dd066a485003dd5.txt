Add a cluster block that allows to delete indices that are read-only (#24678)

Today when an index is `read-only` the index is also blocked from
being deleted which sometimes is undesired since in-order to make
changes to a cluster indices must be deleted to free up space. This is
a likely scenario in a hosted environment when disk-space is limited to switch
indices read-only but allow deletions to free up space.
