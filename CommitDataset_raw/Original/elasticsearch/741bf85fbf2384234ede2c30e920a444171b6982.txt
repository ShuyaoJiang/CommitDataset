Remove incorrect bwc branch logic from master

Commit elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch@b07aa78a7b0e775cd40b3f02318f4dca48f07f73 was a forward port of logic needed in 5.x to get
the correct bwc branch. However, other changes on master meant that this forward port was not
needed and actually broke the bwc tests. This change removes the incorrect if statement and project name.
