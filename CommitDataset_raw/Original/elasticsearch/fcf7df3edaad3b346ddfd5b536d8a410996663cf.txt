Core: Handle security manager permission for deprecation log rolling (#37281)

When the deprecation log is written to within scripting support code
like ScriptDocValues, it runs under the reduces privileges of scripts.
Sometimes this can trigger log rolling, which then causes uncaught
security errors, as was handled in #28485. While doing individual
deprecation handling within each deprecation scripting location is
possible, there are a growing number of deprecations in scripts.

This commit wraps the logging call within the deprecation logger use a
doPrivileged block, just was we would within individual logging call
sites for scripting utilities.
