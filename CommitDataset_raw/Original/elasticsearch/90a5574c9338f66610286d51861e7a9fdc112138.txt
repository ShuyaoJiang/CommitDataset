Add CompressibleBytesOutputStream for compression (#24927)

This is a follow-up to #23941. Currently there are a number of
complexities related to compression. The raw DeflaterOutputStream must
be closed prior to sending bytes to ensure that EOS bytes are written.
But the underlying ReleasableBytesStreamOutput cannot be closed until
the bytes are sent to ensure that the bytes are not reused.

Right now we have three different stream references hanging around in
TCPTransport to handle this complexity. This commit introduces
CompressibleBytesOutputStream to be one stream implemenation that will
behave properly with or without compression enabled.
