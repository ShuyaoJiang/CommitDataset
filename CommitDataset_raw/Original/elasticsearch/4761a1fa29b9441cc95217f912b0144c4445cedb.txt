Do not return all indices if a specific alias is requested via get aliases api. (#29538)

If a get alias api call requests a specific alias pattern then
indices not having any matching aliases should not be included in the response.

This is a second attempt to fix this (first attempt was #28294).
The reason that the first attempt was reverted is because when xpack
security is enabled then index expression (like * or _all) are resolved
prior to when a request is processed in the get aliases transport action,
then `MetaData#findAliases` can't know whether requested all where
requested since it was already expanded in concrete alias names. This
change replaces aliases(...) replaceAliases(...) method on AliasesRequests
class and leave the aliases(...) method on subclasses. So there is a distinction
between when xpack security replaces aliases and a user setting aliases via
the transport or high level http client.

Closes #27763
