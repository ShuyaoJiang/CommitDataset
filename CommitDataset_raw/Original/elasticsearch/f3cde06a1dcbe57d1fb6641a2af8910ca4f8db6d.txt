geotile_grid implementation (#37842)

Implements `geotile_grid` aggregation

This patch refactors previous implementation https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/30240

This code uses the same base classes as `geohash_grid` agg, but uses a different hashing
algorithm to allow zoom consistency.  Each grid bucket is aligned to Web Mercator tiles.
