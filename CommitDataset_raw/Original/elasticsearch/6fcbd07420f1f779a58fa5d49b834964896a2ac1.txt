Remove heuristics that enable security on trial licenses (#38075)

In 6.3 trial licenses were changed to default to security
disabled, and ee added some heuristics to detect when security should
be automatically be enabled if `xpack.security.enabled` was not set.

This change removes those heuristics, and requires that security be
explicitly enabled (via the `xpack.security.enabled` setting) for
trial licenses.
