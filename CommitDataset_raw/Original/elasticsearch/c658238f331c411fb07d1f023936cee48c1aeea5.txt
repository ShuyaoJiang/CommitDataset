[Logstash][Monitoring] Fix Registered Usage and Add Tests (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4075)

This properly registers the `XPackFeatureSetUsage` for Logstash and
it tests it by invoking the Usage API in a Monitoring QA test.

Without those being properly registered, the test will consistently fail.
