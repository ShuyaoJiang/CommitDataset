Remove obsolete deprecation checks (#37510)

* Remove obsolete deprecation checks

This also updates the old-indices check to be appropriate for the 7.x
series of releases, and leaves it as the only deprecation check in
place.

* Add toString to DeprecationIssue

* Bring filterChecks across from 6.x

* License headers
