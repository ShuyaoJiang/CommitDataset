Watcher: Restore old WatcherStatsAction for BWC (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2022)

To achieve backwards compatibility the easiest way is
to restore the old watcher stats, which are supposed to run
on the master node only.

The distributed watcher stats have been moved under the statsdist
package and the action name has been changed as well.

This way there is no need to have a serialization BWC layer,
we can just call different actions.

Note: With the current approach developers still need to change
their java applications if they try to receive watcher stats,
as by default we are now using the distributed stats in the
watcher client.
