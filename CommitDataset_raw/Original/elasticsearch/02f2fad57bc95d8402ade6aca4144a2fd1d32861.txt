Add a task to run forbiddenapis using cli (#32076)

* Add a task to run forbiddenapis using cli

Add a task that offers an equivalent check to the forbidden APIs plugin,
but runs it using the forbiddenAPIs CLI instead.

This isn't wired into precommit first, and doesn't work for projects
that require specific signatures, etc. It's meant to show how this can
be used. The next step is to make a custom task type and configure it
based on the project extension from the pugin and make some minor
adjustments to some build scripts as we can't  bee 100% compatible with
that at least due to how additional signatures are passed.

Notes:
- there's no `--target` for the CLI version so we have to pass in
specific bundled signature names
- the cli task already wires to `runtimeJavaHome`
- no equivalent for `failOnUnsupportedJava = false` but doesn't seem to
be a problem. Tested with Java 8 to 11
- there's no way to pass additional signatures as URL, these will have
to be on the file system, and can't be resources on the cp unless we
rely on how forbiddenapis is implemented and mimic them as boundled
signatures.
- the average of 3 runs is 4% slower using the CLI for :server.
( `./gradlew clean :server:forbiddenApis` vs `./gradlew clean
:server:forbiddenApisCli`)
- up-to-date checks don't work on the cli task yet, that will happen
with the custom task.
