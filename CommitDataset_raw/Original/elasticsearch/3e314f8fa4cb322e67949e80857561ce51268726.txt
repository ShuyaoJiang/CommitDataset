SQL: rewrite ROUND and TRUNCATE functions with a different optional parameter handling method (#40242)

* Rewrite Round and Truncate functions to have a slightly different
approach to handling the optional parameter in the constructor. Until now
the optional parameter was considered 0 if the value was missing and the
constructor was filling in this value. The current solution is to have
the optional parameter as null right until the actual calculation is done.
