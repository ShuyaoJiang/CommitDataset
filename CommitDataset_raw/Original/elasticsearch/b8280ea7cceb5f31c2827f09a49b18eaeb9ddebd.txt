median absolute deviation agg (#34482)

This commit adds a new single value metric aggregation that calculates
the statistic called median absolute deviation, which is a measure of
variability that works on more types of data than standard deviation

Our calculation of MAD is approximated using t-digests. In the collect
phase, we collect each value visited into a t-digest. In the reduce
phase, we merge all value t-digests, then create a t-digest of
deviations using the first t-digest's median and centroids
