Only recommend disabling allocation of replicas in a rolling upgrade (#40299)

The current documentation recommends disabling allocations of all shards. This prevents shards of
new indices from being allocated as well. That means that during a rolling upgrade, operations like
roll over and index shrinking will operate correctly. This, in turn, can cause issues for data ingestion
and ILM.
