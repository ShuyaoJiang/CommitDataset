[TEST] Lower deleteInterval in TokenAuthIntegTests

We run subsequent token invalidation requests and we still want to
trigger the deletion of expired tokens so we need to lower the
deleteInterval parameter significantly. Especially now that the
bwc expiration logic is removed and the invalidation process is
much shorter

Resolves #37063
