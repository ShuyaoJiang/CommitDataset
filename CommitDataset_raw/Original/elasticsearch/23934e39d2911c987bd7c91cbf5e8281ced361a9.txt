Fix deprecated setting specializations (#33412)

Deprecating a some setting specializations (e.g., list settings) does
not cause deprecation warning headers and deprecation log messages to
appear. This is due to a missed check for deprecation. This commit fixes
this for all setting specializations, and ensures that this can not be
missed again.
