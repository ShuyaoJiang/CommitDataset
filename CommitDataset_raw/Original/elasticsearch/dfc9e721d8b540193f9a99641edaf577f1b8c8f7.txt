TEST: Increase timeout for testPrimaryReplicaResyncFailed

The default timeout (eg. 10 seconds) may not be enough for CI to
re-allocate shards after the partion is healed. This commit increases
the timeout to 30 seconds and enables logging in order to have more
detailed information in case this test failed again.

Closes #29060
