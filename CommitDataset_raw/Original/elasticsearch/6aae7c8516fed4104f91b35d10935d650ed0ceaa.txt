SNAPSHOT+TESTS: Speed up Snapshot IT (#36990)

* This speeds up the test from an average 25s down to 7s runtime
* There is no need for artificially slowing down the snapshot to reproduce the issue of an out of sync routing table in practice.
Over hundreds of test runs the test's snapshot shard service still runs in the index not found exception every time reproducing this issue.
* Relates #36294
