Introduce transport API for cluster bootstrapping (#34961)

- Introduces a transport API for bootstrapping a Zen2 cluster
- Introduces a transport API for requesting the set of nodes that a
  master-eligible node has discovered and for waiting until this comprises the
  expected number of nodes.
- Alters ESIntegTestCase to use these APIs when forming a cluster, rather than
  injecting the initial configuration directly.
