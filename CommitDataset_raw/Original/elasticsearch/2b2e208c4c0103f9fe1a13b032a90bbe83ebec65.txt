Docs: Remove range notation from random score docs (#35093)

The `random_score` function produces values between 0 (inclusive) and 1
(exclusive) and documented it with fancy methematical range notation. It
is so fancy I thought it was a typo. This changes the documentation to
use words.

Relates to #35084
