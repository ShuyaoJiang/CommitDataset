SQL: Rename SQL type DATE to DATETIME (#37395)

* SQL: Rename SQL data type DATE to DATETIME

SQL data type DATE has only the date part (e.g.: 2019-01-14)
without any time information. Previously the SQL type DATE was
referring to the ES DATE which contains also the time part along
with TZ information. To conform with SQL data types the data type
`DATE` is renamed to `DATETIME`, since it includes also the time,
as a new runtime SQL `DATE` data type will be introduced down the road,
which only contains the date part and meets the SQL standard.
