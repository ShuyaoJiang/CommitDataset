Moves Actions and related to plugin:core

This change moves the Action classes and referenced data model classes to the new :x-pack-elasticsearch:plugin:core project in preparation for splitting the x-pack features into their own gradle modules.

Note that the TransportAction classes had to be promoted to their own class file (rather than being inner classes to their Action) so they can remain in the plugin project (and will late be move to the `index-lifecycle` project when its created.
