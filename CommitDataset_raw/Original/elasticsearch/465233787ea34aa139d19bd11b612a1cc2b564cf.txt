Move creation of temporary directory to Java (#36002)

In the long run we want to move all of startup to a Java program. This
will simplify our startup scripts and make maintenance of startup less
dependent on the underlying platform that we run on. This commit moves
the creation of the temporary directory off of system-dependent commands
and onto a simple Java program.
