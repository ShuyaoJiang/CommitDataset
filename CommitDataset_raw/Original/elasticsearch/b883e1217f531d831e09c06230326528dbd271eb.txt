Lazy configure build tasks that require older JDKs (#29519)

Some build tasks require older JDKs. For example, the BWC build tasks
for older versions of Elasticsearch require older JDKs. It is onerous to
require these be configured when merely compiling Elasticsearch, the
requirement that they be strictly set to appropriate values should only
be enforced if these tasks are going to be executed. To address this, we
lazy configure these tasks.
