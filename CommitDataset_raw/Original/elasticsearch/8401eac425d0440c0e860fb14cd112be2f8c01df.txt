Test: Switch painless test to 1 shard

We *think* that #28600 is caused by warnings not being collected during
one of the fan out phases of search but we're not 100% sure how this is
happening. This commit drops the number of shards used for the test to 1
so there *isn't* a fan out phase. If this makes the issue go away we'll
have more information.
