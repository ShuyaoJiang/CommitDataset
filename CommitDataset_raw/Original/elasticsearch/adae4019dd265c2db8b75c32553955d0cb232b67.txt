SQL: improve exception when error can't be parsed (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3024)

When an error response wasn't parseable we would through fairly obscure
error messages about what is wrong with it. Great if you are fixing a
bug in Elasticsearch, no great if a proxy eats the response. This adds
the response to the error messages so you can see what was returned.
