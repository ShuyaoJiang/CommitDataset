Picks offset source for the unified highlighter directly from the es mapping (#25747)

This commit changes how the offset source is picked for each field using the es mapping rather than the underlying Lucene field infos.
It's mandatory for large mappings where field infos retrieval can be costly (the global field infos is merged for each highlighted field in every hit by the Lucene impl).

Fixes #25699
