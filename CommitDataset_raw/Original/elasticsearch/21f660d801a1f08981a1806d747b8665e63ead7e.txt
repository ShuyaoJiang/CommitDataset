[Rollup] Remove builders from DateHistogramGroupConfig (#32555)

Same motivation as #32507 but for the DateHistogramGroupConfig
configuration object. This pull request also changes the format of the
time zone from a Joda's DateTimeZone to a simple String.

It should help to port the API to the high level rest client and allows
clients to not be forced to use the Joda Time library. Serialization is
impacted but does not need a backward compatibility layer as
DateTimeZone are serialized as String anyway. XContent also expects
a String for timezone, so I found it easier to move everything to String.
