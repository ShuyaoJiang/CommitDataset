Rename the bulk thread pool to write thread pool (#29593)

This commit renames the bulk thread pool to the write thread pool. This
is to better reflect the fact that the underlying thread pool is used to
execute any document write request (single-document index/delete/update
requests, and bulk requests).

With this change, we add support for fallback settings
thread_pool.bulk.* which will be supported until 7.0.0.

We also add a system property so that the display name of the thread
pool remains as "bulk" if needed to avoid breaking users.
