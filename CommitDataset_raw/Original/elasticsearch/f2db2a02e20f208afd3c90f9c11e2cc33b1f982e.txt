Truncate tlog cli should assign global checkpoint (#28192)

We are targeting to always have a safe index once the recovery is done. 
This invariant does not hold if the translog is manually truncated by 
users because the truncate translog cli resets the global checkpoint to
unassigned. This commit assigns the global checkpoint to the max_seqno
of the last commit when truncating translog. We can only safely do it
because the truncate translog command will generate a new history uuid
for that shard. With a new history UUID, sequence-based recovery between
that shard and other old shards will be disabled.
