[Tests] Fix GetResultTests and DocumentFieldTests failures (#29083)

Changes made in #28972 seems to have changed some assumptions about how
SMILE and CBOR write byte[] values and how this is tested. This changes
the generation of the randomized DocumentField values back to BytesArray
while expecting the JSON and YAML deserialisation to produce Base64
encoded strings and SMILE and CBOR to parse back BytesArray instances.

Closes #29080
