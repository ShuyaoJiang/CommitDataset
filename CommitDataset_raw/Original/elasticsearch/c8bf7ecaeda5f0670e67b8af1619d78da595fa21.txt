Higlighters: Fix MultiPhrasePrefixQuery rewriting (#25103)

The unified highlighter rewrites MultiPhrasePrefixQuery to SpanNearQuer even when there is a single term in the phrase.
Though SpanNearQuery throws an exception when the number of clauses is less than 2.
This change returns a simple PrefixQuery when there is a single term and builds the SpanNearQuery otherwise.
