Docs: DRY up CRUD docs (#34203)

This further applies the pattern set in #34125 to reduce copy-and-paste
in the single document CRUD portion of the High Level REST Client docs.
It also adds line wraps to snippets that are too wide to fit into the box
when rendered in the docs, following up on the work started in #34163.
