[DOCS] Add "remove a tag" script logic as an example (#32556)

It took me quite a while of online searching and experimenting to realize the function-call asymmetry in the Add versus Remove from a list, like the "tags" list! I realize we cannot give examples for every single thing the user wants to do in Painless, but this is such a common use case (removing a tag from a single doc, or from a set of docs with Update-By-Query) that I believe it ought to be demonstrated immediately after the "add a tag" example. We have an example of removing an entire document field, but not removing one element of a list (a multi-valued field).

Also, a minor grammar fix: I have added an apostrophe to the word "its" in the accompanying text of the example just above.
