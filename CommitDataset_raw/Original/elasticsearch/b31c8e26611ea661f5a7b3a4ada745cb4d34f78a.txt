[Monitoring] Remove Specific ClusterStateCollector/Resolver and Tests (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1664)

This removes the Cluster State collector and resolver and moves the collection of the cluster state (and cluster health, which is already included in cluster stats).

This makes the tests a little more stable and removes an extra network hop during monitoring data collection.
