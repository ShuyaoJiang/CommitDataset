SignificantText aggregation - like significant_terms, but for text (#24432)

* SignificantText aggregation - like significant_terms but doesnâ€™t require fielddata=true, recommended used with `sampler` agg to limit expense of tokenizing docs and takes optional `filter_duplicate_text`:true setting to avoid stats skew from repeated sections of text in search results.

Closes #23674
