[CCR Monitoring] Only collect stats for specified indices (#33646)

Follow up to #33617. Relates to #30086.

As with all other per-index Monitoring collectors, the `CcrStatsCollector` should only collect stats for the indices the user wants to monitor. This list is controlled by the `xpack.monitoring.collection.indices` setting and defaults to all indices.
