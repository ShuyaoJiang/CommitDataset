Fix test fixtures on aufs (#36105)

Closes #36073

The problem showed up on debian 8 which uses aufs docker storage
driver by default as opposed to overlay2 used on other distros.
aufs does not support acls and thus the failure.
The --use-ntvfs option instructs samba not to rely on acls.
From what I can tell this is an implementation detail that should not
affect the tests ( which continue to pass )
