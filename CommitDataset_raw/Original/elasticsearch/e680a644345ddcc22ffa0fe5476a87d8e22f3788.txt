cluster formation DSL - Gradle integration -  part 2 (#32028)

* Implement Version in java

- This allows to move all  all .java files from .groovy.
- Will prevent eclipse from tangling up in this setup
- make it possible to use Version from Java

* PR review comments

* Cluster formation plugin with reference counting

```
> Task :plugins:ingest-user-agent:listElasticSearchClusters
Starting cluster: myTestCluster
   * myTestCluster: /home/alpar/work/elastic/elasticsearch/plugins/ingest-user-agent/foo
Asked to unClaimAndStop myTestCluster, since cluster still has 1 claim it will not be stopped

> Task :plugins:ingest-user-agent:testme UP-TO-DATE
Stopping myTestCluster, since no of claims is 0
```

- Meant to auto manage the clusters lifecycle
- Add integration test for cluster formation

* Fix rebase

* Change to `useCluster` method on task
