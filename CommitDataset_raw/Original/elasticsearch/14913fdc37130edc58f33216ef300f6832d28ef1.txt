keep _parent field while updating child type mapping (#24407)

parent/child: Allow updating mapping without specifying `_parent` field on each update.

Prior to this change when a mapping has a `_parent` field then any update (also updates that didn't modify the `_parent` field) to the mapping involved specifying the `_parent` field again. With this change specifying the `_parent` field on each mapping update is no longer required.

Closes #23381
