CCR: replicates max seq_no of updates to follower (#34051)

This commit replicates the max_seq_no_of_updates on the leading index
to the primaries of the following index via ShardFollowNodeTask. The
max_seq_of_updates is then transmitted to the replicas of the follower
via replication requests (that's BulkShardOperationsRequest).
