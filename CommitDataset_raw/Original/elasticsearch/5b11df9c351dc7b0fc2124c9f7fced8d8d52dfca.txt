DOCS: Make ellipsis optional in /cat/thread_pool (#33186)

The fix proposed in #31442 fails with the oss distro because the added
3dots does not match anything with the default oss while a 3dots
expression requires matching at least one thread pool.

This change makes an ellipsis optional so the thread_pool list can match
both the oss distro (without ccr) and default distro (with ccr).
