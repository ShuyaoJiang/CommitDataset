Use holder pattern for lazy deprecation loggers

In a few places we need to lazy initialize static deprecation
loggers. This is needed to avoid touching logging before logging is
configured, but deprecation loggers that are used in foundational
classes like settings and parsers would be initialized before logging is
configured. Previously we used a lazy set once pattern which is fine,
but there's a simpler approach: the holder pattern.
