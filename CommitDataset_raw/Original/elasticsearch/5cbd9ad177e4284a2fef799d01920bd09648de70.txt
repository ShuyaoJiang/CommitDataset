Rename ranking evaluation response section (#32166)

Currently the ranking evaluation response contains a 'unknown_docs' section 
for each search use case in the evaluation set. It contains document ids for 
results in the search hits that currently don't have a quality rating.
This change renames it to `unrated_docs`, which better reflects its purpose.
