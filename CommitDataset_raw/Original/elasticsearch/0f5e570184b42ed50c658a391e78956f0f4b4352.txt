Deprecates indexing and querying a context completion field without context (#30712)

This change deprecates completion queries and documents without context that target a
context enabled completion field. Querying without context degrades the search
performance considerably (even when the number of indexed contexts is low).
This commit targets master but the deprecation will take place in 6.x and the functionality
will be removed in 7 in a follow up.

Closes #29222
