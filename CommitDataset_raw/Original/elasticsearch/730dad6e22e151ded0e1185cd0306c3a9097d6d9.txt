Use default discovery implementation for single-node discovery (#40036)

Switches "discovery.type: single-node" from using a separate implementation for single-node discovery to using the existing standard discovery implementation, with two small adaptions:

-  auto-bootstrapping, but requiring initial_master_nodes not to be set.
- not actively pinging other nodes using the Peerfinder
- not allowing other nodes to join its single-node cluster (if they have e.g. been set up using regular discovery and connect to the single-disco node).
