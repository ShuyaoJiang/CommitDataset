Fix duplicate removal when merging completion suggestions (#36996)

The completion suggester ignores the original weight of the suggestion when duplicates are removed. This change fixes this bug and keeps the best weighted suggestion among the duplicates. It also removes the custom implementation of the top docs suggest collector now that https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-8529 is committed in Lucene.

Closes #35836
