SQL: Return error with ORDER BY on non-grouped. (#34855)

Previously, for some queries the validation for ORDER BY
fields didn't kick in since a HAVING close or an ORDER BY
with scalar function would add `Filter` and `Project` plans
between the `OrderBy` and the `Aggregate`.

Now the LogicalPlan tree beneath `OrderBy` is traversed and
the ORDER BY fields are properly verified.

Fixes: #34590
