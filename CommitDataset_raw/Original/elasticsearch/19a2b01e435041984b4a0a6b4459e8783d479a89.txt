Build: Omit dependency licenses check for elasticsearch deps (#28304)

Sometimes modules/plugins depend on locally built elasticsearch jars.
This means not only that the jar is constantly changing (so no need for
a sha check), but also that the license falls under the Elasticsearch
license, and there is no need to keep another copy. This commit updates
the dependencies checked by dependencyLicenses to exclude those that are
built by elasticsearch.
