Skip shard refreshes if shard is `search idle` (#27500)

Today we refresh automatically in the background by default very second.
This default behavior has a significant impact on indexing performance
if the refreshes are not needed.
This change introduces a notion of a shard being `search idle` which a
shard transitions to after (default) `30s` without any access to an
external searcher. Once a shard is search idle all scheduled refreshes
will be skipped unless there are any refresh listeners registered.
If a search happens on a `serach idle` shard the search request _park_
on a refresh listener and will be executed once the next scheduled refresh
occurs. This will also turn the shard into the `non-idle` state immediately.

This behavior is only applied if there is no explicit refresh interval set.
