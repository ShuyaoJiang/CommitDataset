Add remote cluster infrastructure to fetch discovery nodes. (#25123)

In order to add scroll support for cross cluster search we need
to resolve the nodes encoded in the scroll ID to send requests to the
corresponding nodes. This change adds the low level connection infrastructure
that also ensures that connections are re-established if the cluster is
disconnected due to a network failure or restarts.
