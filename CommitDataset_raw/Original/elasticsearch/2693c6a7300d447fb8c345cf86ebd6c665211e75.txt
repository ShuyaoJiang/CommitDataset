[ML] improve logging for autodetect crashes (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2866)

Improving logging for unexpected autodetect termination (crash, oom). Output to the log pipe not conforming to the json log output format are treated as fatal error and logged, so that the crash as well as a proper error message if available gets logged.
