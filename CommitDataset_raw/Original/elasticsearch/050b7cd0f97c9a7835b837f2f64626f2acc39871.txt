Include empty mappings in GET /{index}/_mappings requests (#25118)

Previously this would output:

```
GET /test-1/_mappings

{ }
```

And after this change:

```
GET /test-1/_mappings

{
  "test-1": {
    "mappings": {}
  }
}
```

To bring parity back to the REST output after #24723.

Relates to #25090
