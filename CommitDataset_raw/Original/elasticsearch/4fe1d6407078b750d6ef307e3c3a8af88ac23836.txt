Add POM and license generation for X-Pack artifacts

With the switch to X-Pack as a module, we lost production of POMs for
the JARs that we publish, and did not have a license/notice file in the
zip archives nor the exploded module. This commit ensures that we
generate these POMs, and license/notice files.
