Use PlainListenableActionFuture for CloseFuture (#26242)

Right now we use a custom future for the CloseFuture associated with a
channel. This is because we need special unwrapping logic to ensure that
exceptions from a future failure are a certain type (opposed to an
UncategorizedException). However, the current version is limiting
because we can only attach one listener.

This commit changes the CloseFuture to extend the
PlainListenableActionFuture. This change allows us to attach multiple
listeners.
