Skip some plugins service tests on Windows

These tests need to be skipped. They cause plugins to be loaded which
causes a child classloader to be opened. We do not want to add the
permissions to be able to close a classloader solely for these tests,
and the JARs created in the test can not be deleted on Windows until the
classloader is closed. Since this will not happen before test teardown,
the test will fail on Windows. So, we skip these tests.
