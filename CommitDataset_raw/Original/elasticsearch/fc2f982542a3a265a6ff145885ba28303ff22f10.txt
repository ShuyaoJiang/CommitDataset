inherit [index.lifecycle.date] from rolled-over time (#30853)

Indices that are rolled over preserve their origin index.lifecycle.date
as the time the index was created. Although this is also fine, it would
make more sense to start the timer for moving to the warm phase from the
time it was rolled over so that we capture the time elapsed from the
latest data, as opposed to when the index was created.

This commit adds an extra step within the RolloverAction that
extracts the index.creation_date of the newly created index from the RolloverStep
and sets that as the index.lifecycle.date of the rolled-over index that is
waiting for its next phase.
