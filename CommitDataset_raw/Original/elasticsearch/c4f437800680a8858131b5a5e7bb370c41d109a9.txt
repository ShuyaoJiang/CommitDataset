Core: Rework multi date formatter merging (#36447)

This commit moves the MergedDateFormatter to a package private class and
reworks joda DateFormatter instances to use that instead of a single
DateTimeFormatter with multiple parsers. This will allow the java and
joda multi formats to share the same format parsing method in a
followup.
