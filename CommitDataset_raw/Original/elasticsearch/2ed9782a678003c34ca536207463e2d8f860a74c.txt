Scripting: Fix painless compiler loader to know about context classes (#32385)

This commit fixes the painless compiler classloader to know about the
classes from the script context. This fixes an issue when a custom
context is used from a plugin which caused a ClassNotFoundException for
the script class and its factory classes.
