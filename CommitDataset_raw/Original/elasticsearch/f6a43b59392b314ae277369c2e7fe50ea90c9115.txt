Add a prebuilt ICU Analyzer (#34958)

The ICU plugin provides the building blocks of an analysis chain, but doesn't actually have a prebuilt analyzer. It would be a better for users if there was a simple analyzer that they could use out of the box, and also something we can point to from the CJK Analyzer docs as a superior alternative.
