Ensure intended key is selected in SamlAuthenticatorTests (#30993)

* Ensure that a purposefully wrong key is used

Uses a specific keypair for tests that require a purposefully wrong
keypair instead of selecting one randomly from the same pull from
which the correct one is selected. Entropy is low because of the
small space and the same key can be randomly selected as both the
correct one and the wrong one, causing the tests to fail.
The purposefully wrong key is also used in 
testSigningKeyIsReloadedForEachRequest and needs to be cleaned
up afterwards so the rest of the tests don't use that for signing.

Resolves #30970
