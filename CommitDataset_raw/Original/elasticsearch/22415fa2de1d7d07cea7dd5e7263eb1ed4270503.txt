[ML] Fix character set finder bug with unencodable charsets (#33234)

Some character sets cannot be encoded and this was tripping
up the binary data check in the ML log structure character
set finder.

The fix is to assume that if ICU4J identifies that some bytes
correspond to a character set that cannot be encoded and those
bytes contain zeroes then the data is binary rather than text.
