Scripting: Remove getDate methods from ScriptDocValues (#30690)

The getDate() and getDates() existed prior to 5.x on long fields in
scripting. In 5.x, a new Date type for ScriptDocValues was added. The
getDate() and getDates() methods were left on long fields and added to date
fields to ease the transition. This commit removes those methods for
7.0.
