Build: Move test files from plugin/src to appropriate other projects (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3653)

This commit moves mostly security tests that were left in plugin/src. It
also moves the CompositeTestingXPackPlugin into tribe license tests qa
project, which was the only remaining use. This class needs to be
removed, as it has unavoidable problems with dependency conflicts (ie
guava) between security and watcher, which it pulls in both into the
test classpath.
