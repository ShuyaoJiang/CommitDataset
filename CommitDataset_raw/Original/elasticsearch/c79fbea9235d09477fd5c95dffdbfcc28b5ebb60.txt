[Zen2] Implement basic cluster formation (#33668)

This PR integrates the following pieces of machinery in the Coordinator:

- discovery
- pre-voting
- randomised election scheduling
- joining (of a new master)
- publication of cluster state updates

Together, these things are everything needed to form a cluster. We therefore
also add the start of a test suite that allows us to assert higher-level
properties of the interactions between all these pieces of machinery, with as
little fake behaviour as possible. We assert one such property: "a cluster
successfully forms".
