Polishing for handling subtleties in the JDBC behavior: (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2967)

1. decouple JdbcDriver from other classes to not trigger static
initialization (this happens through JDBC service discovery)
2. reduce visibility of JdbcDriver#close so only on jar unloading it
gets triggered
3. mark 3 methods introduced in Jdbc 4.1 as unsupported (their semantics
are somewhat weird)
4. Move versioning info in one class
5. Hook Version class in both JDBC entry points to perform cp sanity
checks
6. Remove JdbcDataSource#close (DebugLog are closed when the Driver gets
unloaded by the DriverManager) as there can be multiple instances of DS
but only one for Driver known by the DriverManager

Replace Strings with constants
Properly set TZ in security tests as well
JdbcDataSource is more defensive with its internal properties
JdbcConfiguration password parameter is aligned with JDBC DriverManager
Remove usage of JdbcConnection API
Removed JdbcConnection#setTimeZone - this encourages folks to use our
private API which would tie us down.
It is somewhat limiting for folks but it has less downsides overall and
does not trip debugging (which adds a proxy unaware of this method).
Update docs
Add JdbcDataSource into the Jdbc suite
