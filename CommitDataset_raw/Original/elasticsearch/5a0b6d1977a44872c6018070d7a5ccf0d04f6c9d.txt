Use the primary_term field to identify parent documents (#27469)

This change stops indexing the `_primary_term` field for nested documents
to allow fast retrieval of parent documents. Today we create a docvalues
field for children to ensure we have a dense datastructure on disk. Yet,
since we only use the primary term to tie-break on when we see the same
seqID on indexing having a dense datastructure is less important. We can
use this now to improve the nested docs performance and it's memory footprint.
