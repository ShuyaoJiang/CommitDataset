[ML] Write model_memory_limit with units into the cluster state (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1934)

This is step 2 of elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1604

This change stores `model_memory_limit` as a string with `mb` unit.
I considered using the `toString` method of `ByteSizeValue` but it
can lead to accuracy loss. Adding the fixed `mb` unit maintains
the accuracy, while making clear what unit the value is in.
