Introduce long polling for changes (#33683)

Rather than scheduling pings to the leader index when we are caught up
to the leader, this commit introduces long polling for changes. We will
fire off a request to the leader which if we are already caught up will
enter a poll on the leader side to listen for global checkpoint
changes. These polls will timeout after a default of one minute, but can
also be specified when creating the following task. We use these time
outs as a way to keep statistics up to date, to not exaggerate time
since last fetches, and to avoid pipes being broken.
