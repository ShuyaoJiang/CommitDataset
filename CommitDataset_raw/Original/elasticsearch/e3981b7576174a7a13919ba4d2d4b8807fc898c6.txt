Fix Token Service retry mechanism (#39639)

Fixes several errors of the token retry logic:

* not checking for backoff.hasNext() before calling backoff.next()
* checking for backoff.hasNext() without calling backoff.next()
* not preserving the context on the retry
* calling scheduleWithFixedDelay instead of schedule
