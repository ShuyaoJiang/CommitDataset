Tests: Fix TimeThrottleIntegrationTests to not rely on shard actions (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2234)

These tests used to fail rarely, because during a watch execution
one of the watcher shards was relocated resulting in a second execution
of watch.

In order to prevent this, the tests do not need to actually create any
shards, which causes watcher potentially to be rebalanced.

This simplifies and speeds up the test as well.
