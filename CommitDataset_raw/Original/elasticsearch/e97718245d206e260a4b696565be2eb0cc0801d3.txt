Test: Enable strict deprecation on all tests (#36558)

This drops the option for tests to disable strict deprecation mode in
the low level rest client in favor of configuring expected warnings on
any calls that should expect warnings. This behavior is
paranoid-by-default which is generally the right way to handle
deprecations and tests in general.
