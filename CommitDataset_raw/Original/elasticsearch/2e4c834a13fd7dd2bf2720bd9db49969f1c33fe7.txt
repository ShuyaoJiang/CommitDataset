Switch to non-deprecated ParseField.match method for o.e.search (#28526)

* Switch to non-deprecated ParseField.match method for o.e.search

This replaces more of the `ParseField.match` calls with the same call using a
deprecation handler. It encapsulates all of the instances in the
`org.elastsicsearch.search` package.

Relates to #28504

* Address Nik's comments
