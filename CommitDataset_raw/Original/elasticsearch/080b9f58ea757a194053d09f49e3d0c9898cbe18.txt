[TEST] Test for shard failures, add debug to testProfileMatchesRegular

Unmuting the test and adding some more debug output.  Was not able to
reproduce the prior failure, but it seems possible that the
failure (mismatched counts) could be caused by partial search results
during the test.

The assertions check for shard failures first, because if one of the
two searches is partial the rest of the test will fail.

Next, instead of just checking respective hit counts, we emit the
difference in hits to help identify what went wrong.

Closes #32492
