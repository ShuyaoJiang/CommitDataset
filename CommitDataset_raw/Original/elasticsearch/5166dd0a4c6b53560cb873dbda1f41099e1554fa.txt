Replicate max seq_no of updates to replicas (#33967)

We start tracking max seq_no_of_updates on the primary in #33842. This
commit replicates that value from a primary to its replicas in replication 
requests or the translog phase of peer-recovery.

With this change, we guarantee that the value of max seq_no_of_updates
on a replica when any index/delete operation is performed at least the
max_seq_no_of_updates on the primary when that operation was executed.
