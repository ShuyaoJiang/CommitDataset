ingest: processor stats (#34202)

This change introduces stats per processors. Total, time, failed,
current are currently supported. All pipelines will now show all
top level processors that belong to it. Failure processors are not
displayed, however, the time taken to execute the failure chain is part
of the stats for the top level processor.

The processor name is the type of the processor, ordered as defined in
the pipeline. If a tag for the processor is found, then the tag is
appended to the type.

Pipeline processors will have the pipeline name appended to the name of
the name of the processors (before the tag if one exists). If more
then one pipeline is used to process the document, then each pipeline
will carry its own stats. The outer most pipeline will also include the
inner most pipeline stats.

Conditional processors will only included in the stats if the condition evaluates
to true.
