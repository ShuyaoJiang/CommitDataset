Remove usage of `index.shrink.source.*` in 7.x (#33271)

We cut over to `index.resize.source.*` but still have these constants
being public in `IndexMetaData`. Those Settings and constants are not needed
in 7.x while we still need to keep the keys known to private settings since
they might be part of the index settings of old indices. We can remove that
in 8.0. Yet, we should remove the settings to make sure they are not used again.
