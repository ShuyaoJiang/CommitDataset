Docs: Simplifying setup by using module configuration variant syntax (#40879)

Now that https://github.com/elastic/beats/pull/9118 is merged, starting 7.1 users will be able configure Metricbeat for monitoring Elasticsearch nodes using a simpler syntax.

Previously, users would have to run `metricbeat modules enable elasticsearch` to enable the `elasticsearch` Metricbeat module, then configure the module for Stack Monitoring by manually editing `modules.d/elasticsearch.yml`. Going forward, users will be able to achieve the same effect by running `metricbeat modules enable elasticsearch-xpack`.

This PR updates the docs with this change.
