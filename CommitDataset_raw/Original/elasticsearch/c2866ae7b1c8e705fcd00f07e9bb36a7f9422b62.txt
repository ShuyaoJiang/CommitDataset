Adjust version check for TokensInvalidationResult (#39720)

Now that the relevant changes are backported to 7.x, 7.1 nodes in
BWC test will not expect to read/write the attempt counter so we
can adjust the version check on serialization deserialization.
This change also enables the tests that have been muted because
they would fail while the change was being backported.
