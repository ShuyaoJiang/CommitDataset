Remove Migration Upgrade and Assistance APIs (#40075)

The Migration Assistance API has been functionally replaced by the
Deprecation Info API, and the Migration Upgrade API is not used for the
transition from ES 6.x to 7.x, and does not need to be kept around to
repair indices that were not properly upgraded before upgrading the
cluster, as was the case in 6.
