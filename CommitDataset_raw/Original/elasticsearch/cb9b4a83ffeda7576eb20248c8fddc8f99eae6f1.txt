Reindex from Remote allow date math (#40303)

Previously, reindexing from remote using date math in the source index
name did not work if the math contained / or ,. A workaround was to
then URL escape the index name in the request.

With this change, we now support any index name in the remote request
that the remote source supports, doing the URL escape when sending the
request.
