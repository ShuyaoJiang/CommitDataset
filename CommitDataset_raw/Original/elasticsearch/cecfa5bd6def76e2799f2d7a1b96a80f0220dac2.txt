Tighten mapping syncing in ccr remote restore (#38071)

There are two issues regarding the way that we sync mapping from leader
to follower when a ccr restore is completed:

1.  The returned mapping from a cluster service might not be up to date
as the mapping of the restored index commit.

2. We should not compare the mapping version of the follower and the
leader. They are not related to one another.

Moreover, I think we should only ensure that once the restore is done,
the mapping on the follower should be at least the mapping of the copied
index commit. We don't have to sync the mapping which is updated after
we have opened a session.
