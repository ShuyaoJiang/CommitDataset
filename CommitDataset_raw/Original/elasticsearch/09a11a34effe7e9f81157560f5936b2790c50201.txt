Remove clusterAlias instance member from QueryShardContext (#37923)

The clusterAlias member is only used in the copy constructor, to be able
to reconstruct the fully qualified index. It is also possible to remove
the instance member and add a private constructor that accepts the already built Index object which contains the cluster alias.
