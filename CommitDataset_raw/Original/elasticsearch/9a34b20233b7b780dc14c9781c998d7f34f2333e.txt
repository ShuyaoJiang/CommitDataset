Simplify integ test distribution types (#37618)

The integ tests currently use the raw zip project name as the
distribution type. This commit simplifies this specification to be
"default" or "oss". Whether zip or tar is used should be an internal
implementation detail of the integ test setup, which can (in the future)
be platform specific.
