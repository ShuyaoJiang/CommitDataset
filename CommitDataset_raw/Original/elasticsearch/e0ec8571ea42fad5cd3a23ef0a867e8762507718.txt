Build: introduce keystoreFile for cluster config (#29491)

This commit introduces built in support for adding files to the
keystore when configuring the integration test cluster for a project.

In order to use this support, simply add `keystoreFile` followed by the
secure setting name and the path to the source file inside the
integTestCluster closure for a project. The built in support will
handle the creation of the keystore and the addition of the file to the
keystore.
