Remove Throwable usage from transport modules (#30845)

Currently nio and netty modules use the CompletableFuture class for
managing listeners. This is unfortunate as that class accepts
Throwable. This commit adds a class CompletableContext that wraps
the CompletableFuture but does not accept Throwable. This allows the
modification of netty and nio logic to no longer handle Throwable.
