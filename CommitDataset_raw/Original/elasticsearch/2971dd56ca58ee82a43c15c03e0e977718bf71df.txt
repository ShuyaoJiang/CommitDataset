Enable setting client path prefix to / (#30119)

Some proxies require all requests to have paths starting with / since
there are no relative paths at the HTTP connection level. Elasticsearch
assumes paths are absolute. In order to run rest tests against a cluster
behind such a proxy, set the system property
tests.rest.client_path_prefix to /.
