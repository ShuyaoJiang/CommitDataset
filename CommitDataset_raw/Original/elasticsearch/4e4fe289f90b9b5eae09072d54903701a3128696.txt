SQL: Fix merging of incompatible multi-fields (#39560)

Fix bug in IndexResolver that caused conflicts in multi-field types to
be ignored up (causing the query to fail later on due to mapping
conflicts).
The issue was caused by the multi-field which forced the parent creation
before checking its validity across mappings
