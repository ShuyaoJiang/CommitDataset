Watcher: Replace integration tests with unit and REST tests (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2322)

A bunch of integration tests should have been built as unit tests
or already have unit test equivalents.

This commit removes integration tests as well as adding REST equivalents
or creating unit tests instead of extending from AbstractWatcherIntegrationTestCase
