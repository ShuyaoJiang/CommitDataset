Dedup translog operations by reading in reverse (#27268)

Currently, translog operations are read and processed one by one. This
may be a problem as stale operations in translogs may suddenly reappear
in recoveries. To make sure that stale operations won't be processed, we
read the translog files in a reverse order (eg. from the most recent
file to the oldest file) and only process an operation if its sequence
number was not seen before.
