Test: don't reset node in ClusterPrivilegeTests

In the ClusterPrivilegeTests class, the code was resetting the node
after each test and failures were seen in CI that were HTTP 401 when
a 403 was expected. This commit removes the resetting of the node
between tests as this was not necessary.

Additionally, there is an issue in the SecuritySingleNodeTestCase where
the rest client was not torn down afterstopping a node and starting a
new node. This means the client used in other tests would not be
connected to the right cluster. This change resolves this by tearing
down the rest client after the old node is torn down.
