[Tests] Nudge wait time in RemoteClusterServiceTests (#33853)

This test occasionally fails in `testCollectSearchShards` waiting on what seems
to be a search request to a remote cluster for one second. Given that the test
fails here very rarely I suspect maybe one second is very rarely not enough so
we could fix it by increasing the max wait time slightly.

Closes #33852
