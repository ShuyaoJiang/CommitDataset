Security Audit includes HTTP method for requests (#37322)

Adds another field, named "request.method", to the structured logfile audit.
This field is present for all events associated with a REST request (not a
transport request) and the value is one of GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS,
HEAD, PATCH, TRACE and CONNECT.
