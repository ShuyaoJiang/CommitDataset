Fix SSLContext pinning to TLSV1.2 in reload tests (#38341)

This commit fixes the pinning of SSLContexts to TLSv1.2 in the
SSLConfigurationReloaderTests. The pinning was added for the initial
creation of clients and webservers but the updated contexts would
default to TLSv1.3, which is known to cause hangs with the
MockWebServer that we use.
