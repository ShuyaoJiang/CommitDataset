AsyncTwoPhaseIndexerTests race condition fixed (#37830)

The unlucky timing can cause this test to fail when the indexing is triggered from `maybeTriggerAsyncJob`. As this is asynchronous, in can finish quicker then the test stepping over to next assertion
The introduced barrier solves the problem
closes #37695
