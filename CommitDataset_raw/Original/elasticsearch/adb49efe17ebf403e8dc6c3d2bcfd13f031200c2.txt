Non-peer recovery should set the global checkpoint (#27965)

Non-Peer recoveries should restore the global checkpoint rather than wait for the activation of the primary. This brings us a step closer to a universe where a recovered shard always has a valid global checkpoint. Concretely:

1) Recovery from store can read the checkpoint from the translog
2) Recovery from local shards and snapshots can set the global checkpoint to the local checkpoint as this is the only copy of the shard.
3) Recovery of an empty shard can set it to `NO_OPS_PERFORMED`

Peer recoveries will follow but require more work and thus will have their own PR.

I also used the moment to clean up `IndexShard`'s api around starting the engine and doing recovery from the translog. The current naming are a relic of the past and don't align with the current naming schemes in the engine.
