testMockFailToSendNoConnectRule should wait for connection close to bubble up and disconnect the node

#25521 changed channel closing to be handled async on anything but transport stop. This means it may take a while before
calling `connection.close()` and the node being removed from the `connectedNodes` list (but the connection is immediately unusuable).

Fixes #25686
