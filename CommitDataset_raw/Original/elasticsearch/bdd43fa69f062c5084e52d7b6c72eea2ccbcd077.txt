Change signature of Get Repositories Response (#30333)

The Get Repositories response object held a list of RepositoryMetaData
entries. This object does not have the from/toXContent methods that are
needed to expose this to the high level REST client. The
RepositoriesMetaData, however, does, and it also contains a list of
RepositoryMetaData objects within it. So rather than duplicate this
logic or move it (RepositoriesMetaData is a fragment object used by
cluster state), the object holding state in the Response was changed to
use the RepositoriesMetaData instead. This also cleans up the read/write
methods in the response, as they can now use the same read/write in
RepositoriesMetaData, which also were not present in the singular class.
