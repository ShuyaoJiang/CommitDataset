Scripting: Remove "inline script enabled" on script engines (#24815)

ScriptEngine implementations have an overridable method to indicate they
are safe to use as inline scripts. Since groovy was removed fro 6.0,
there are no longer any implementations which used the default false
value. Furthermore, the value was not actually read anywhere. This
commit removes the method. The ScriptEngineRegistry was also no longer
necessary as it only was used to build a map from language to engine.
