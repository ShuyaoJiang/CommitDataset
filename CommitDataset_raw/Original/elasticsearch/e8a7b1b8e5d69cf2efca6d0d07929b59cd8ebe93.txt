Remove dead path conf BWC code in build

When changing how the config path is configured (from a command-line
flag to an environment variable) we had to add BWC code in the build so
that we could form clusters with 5.x nodes in them. Now that this branch
has moved to 7.x, we no longer need to be BWC with 5.x for starting
nodes. This commit removes this dead BWC code.
