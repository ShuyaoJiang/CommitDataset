Do not serialize basic license exp in x-pack info (#30848)

This is a bug that was identified by the kibana team. Currently on a
get-license call we do not serialize the hard-coded expiration for basic
licenses. However, the kibana team calls the x-pack info route which
still does serialize the expiration date. This commit removes that
serialization in the rest response.
