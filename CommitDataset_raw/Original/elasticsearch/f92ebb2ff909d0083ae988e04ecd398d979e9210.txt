Suppress lease background sync failures if stopping (#40902)

If the transport service is stopped, likely because we are shutting
down, and a retention lease background sync fires the logs will display
a warn message and stacktrace. Yet, this situaton is harmless and can
happen as a normal course of business when shutting down. This commit
suppresses the log messages in this case.
