Ensure that gcs client creation is privileged (#25938)

This is related to #25932. Currently when we create the
`GoogleCloudStorageService` client we do not wrap that call in a
doPrivileged block. The call might open a connection. This commit
ensures that the creation is wrapped in a doPrivileged block.
