REST high-level client: parse back _ignored meta field (#32362)

`GetResult` and `SearchHit` have been adjusted to parse back the `_ignored` meta field whenever it gets printed out. Expanded the existing tests to make sure this is covered. Fixed also a small problem around highlighted fields in `SearchHitTests`.
