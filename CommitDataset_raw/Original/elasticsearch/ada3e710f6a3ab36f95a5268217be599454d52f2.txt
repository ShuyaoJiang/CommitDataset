Renames XPackField.INDEX _LIFCYCLE value to "ilm" (#33270)

This brings the name in line with everywhere else and means that name
seen on the feature usage and `GET _xpack` APIs will match the plugin
name.

This change also removes `IndexLifcycle.NAME` since this was only used
to name the scheduler job and that can be done using
`XPackField.INDEX_LIFECYCLE` instead
