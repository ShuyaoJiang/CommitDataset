Remove silent batch mode from install plugin (#29359)

Today we have a silent batch mode in the install plugin command when
standard input is closed or there is no tty. It appears that
historically this was useful when running tests where we want to accept
plugin permissions without having to acknowledge them. Now that we have
an explicit batch mode flag, this use-case is removed. The motivation
for removing this now is that there is another place where silent batch
mode arises and that is when a user attempts to install a plugin inside
a Docker container without keeping standard input open and attaching a
tty. In this case, the install plugin command will treat the situation
as a silent batch mode and therefore the user will never have the chance
to acknowledge the additional permissions required by a plugin. This
commit removes this silent batch mode in favor of using the --batch flag
when running tests and requiring the user to take explicit action to
acknowledge the additional permissions (either by leaving standard input
open and attaching a tty, or by passing the --batch flags themselves).

Note that with this change the user will now see a null pointer
exception when they try to install a plugin in a Docker container
without keeping standard input open and attaching a tty. This will be
addressed in an immediate follow-up, but because the implications of
that change are larger, they should be handled separately from this one.
