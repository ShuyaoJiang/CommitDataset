Remove the use of AbstracLifecycleComponent constructor #37488 (#37488)

The AbstracLifecycleComponent used to extend AbstractComponent, so it had to pass settings to the constractor of its supper class.
It no longer extends the AbstractComponent so there is no need for this constructor
There is also no need for AbstracLifecycleComponent subclasses to have Settings in their constructors if they were only passing it over to super constructor.
This is part 1. which will be backported to 6.x with a migration guide/deprecation log.
part 2 will have this constructor removed in 7
