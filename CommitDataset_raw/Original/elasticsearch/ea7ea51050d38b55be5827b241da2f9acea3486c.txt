Make `TcpTransport#openConnection` fully async (#36095)

This is a follow-up to #35144. That commit made the underlying
connection opening process in TcpTransport asynchronous. However the
method still blocked on the process being complete before returning.
This commit moves the blocking to the ConnectionManager level. This is
another step towards the top-level TransportService api being async.
