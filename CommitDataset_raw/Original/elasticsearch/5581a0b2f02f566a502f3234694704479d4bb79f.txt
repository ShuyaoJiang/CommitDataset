Scripting: Remove unnecessary generic type from ScriptContext (#24877)

When developing the new ScriptContext, the compiled type was original
generic, so that the instance type was also necessary. However, since
CompiledType is all that is used by the compile method signature, we
actually don't need the instance type to be generic. This commit removes
the InstanceType, and finds the Class for it through reflection on the
CompiledType method.
