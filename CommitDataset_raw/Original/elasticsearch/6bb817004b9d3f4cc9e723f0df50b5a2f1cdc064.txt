Add infrastructure to upgrade settings (#33536)

In some cases we want to deprecate a setting, and then automatically
upgrade uses of that setting to a replacement setting. This commit adds
infrastructure for this so that we can upgrade settings when recovering
the cluster state, as well as when such settings are dynamically applied
on cluster update settings requests. This commit only focuses on cluster
settings, index settings can build on this infrastructure in a
follow-up.
