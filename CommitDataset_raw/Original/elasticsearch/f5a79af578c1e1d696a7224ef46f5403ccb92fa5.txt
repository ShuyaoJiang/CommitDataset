Tighten which classes can exit

Today we allow exiting solely by being in certain packages. This commit
upgrades the securesm dependency to a new version that supports being
explicit about which classes can exit. We utilize that here to only
allow exiting from the uncaught exception handler and the base CLI
command class.

Relates #27482
