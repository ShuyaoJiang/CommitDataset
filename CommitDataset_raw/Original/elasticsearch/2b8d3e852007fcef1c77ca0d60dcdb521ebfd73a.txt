Security: fix dynamic mapping updates with aliases (#30787)

This commit fixes an issue with dynamic mapping updates when an index
operation is performed against an alias and when the user only has
permissions to the alias. Dynamic mapping updates resolve the concrete
index early to prevent issues so the information about the alias that
the triggering operation was being executed against is lost. When
security is enabled and a user only has privileges to the alias, this
dynamic mapping update would be rejected as it is executing against the
concrete index and not the alias. In order to handle this situation,
the security code needs to look at the concrete index and the
authorized indices of the user; if the concrete index is not authorized
the code will attempt to find an alias that the user has permissions to
update the mappings of.
