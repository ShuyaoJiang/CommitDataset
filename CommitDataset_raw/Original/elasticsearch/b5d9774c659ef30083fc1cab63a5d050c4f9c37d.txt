Remove leftover doc comment on client JVM check

We previously specified the -server flag to force the JVM to use the
server JVM. This is the default on all the systems that we support when
using a 64-bit JVM (and we no longer support 32-bit JVMs). There was
some trouble with this flag for the Windows service since procrun did
not understand what to do with it; as such, we had to filter this flag
out in the service. When we migrated to parsing JVM options in Java (via
the JVM options parser) we simplified this situation and removed
specifying the -server flag. This commit removes a leftover statement
that we are forcing the server JVM.
