Watcher: Allow to defer startup for tests (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3903)

This commit introduces a new watcher setting to defer starting watcher
until it has been called with the API for the first time. This is
primarily useful in testing environments, as this ensures that watcher
does not try to reload itself because of starting first and then
creating watcher indices.

In addition the undocumented and unused option
xpack.watcher.start_immediately has been removed.

Relates elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3854
