Match phrase queries against non-indexed fields should throw an exception (#31060)

When `lenient=false`, attempts to create match phrase queries with custom analyzers against non-text fields will throw an IllegalArgumentException.

Also changes `*Match*QueryBuilderTests` so that it avoids this scenario

Fixes #31061
