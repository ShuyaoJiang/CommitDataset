fix: Sort Processor does not have proper behavior with targetField (#25237)

to specify a `targetField`. This results in some interesting behavior that was missed in the review.
This processor sorts in-place, so there is a side-effect in both the original field and the target field.
Another bug was that the targetField was not being set if the list being sorted was fewer than two elements.

The new behavior works like this: If targetField and fieldName are not the same, we copy the list.
