Fix libs:ssl-config project setup (#39074)

The build script file for the `:libs:elasticsearch-ssl-config` and
`:libs:ssl-config-tests` projects was incorrectly named `eclipse.build.gradle`
 while the expected name was `eclipse-build.gradle`.
In addition, this also adds a missing snippet in the `build.gradle` conf file,
that fixes the project setup for Eclipse users.
