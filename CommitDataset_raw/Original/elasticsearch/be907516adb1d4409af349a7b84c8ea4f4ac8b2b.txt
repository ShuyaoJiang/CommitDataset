Change ShardFollowTask defaults (#34793)

Per #31717 this commit changes the defaults to the following:

Batch size of 5120 ops.
Maximum of 12 concurrent read requests.
Maximum of 9 concurrent write requests.

This is not necessarily our final values but it's good to have these as defaults for the purposes of initial testing.
