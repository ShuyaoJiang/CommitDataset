[CCR] Fixed follow and unfollow api url path according to design.

The TODOs in the rest actions was incorrect. The problem was that
these rest actions used `follow_index` as first named variable in the path
under which the rest actions were registered. Other candidate rest actions that
also have a named variable as first element in the path (but with a different
name) get resolved as rest parameters too and passed down to the rest
action that actually ends up getting executed.

In the case of the follow index api, a `index` parameter got passed down
to `RestFollowExistingAction`, but that param was never used. This caused the
follow index api call to fail, because of unused http parameters.

This change doesn't fixes that problem, but works around it by using
`index` as named variable for the follow index (instead of `follow_index`).

Relates to #30102
