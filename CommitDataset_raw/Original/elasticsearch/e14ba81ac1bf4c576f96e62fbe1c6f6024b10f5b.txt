Make ObjectParser support string to boolean conversion (#24668)

We generally accept string values when a boolean is expected. We've been doing that in our parsing code, but we missed that bit when moving parsing code to ObjectParser, which throws an error instead. This commit makes ObjectParser parse also string values into booleans. It throws an error in case the value is not `true` or `false`.
