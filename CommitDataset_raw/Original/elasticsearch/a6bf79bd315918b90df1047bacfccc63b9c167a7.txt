Remove the container work (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2030)

This is related to elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1217. This commit removes the features that were
introduced in elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1832. This is because the containerized version of
x-pack can be have its password bootstrapped using the generalized
keystore mechanism introduced in elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1942.
