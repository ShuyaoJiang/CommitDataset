Decouple more classes from XContentBuilder and make builder strict (#29197)

This commit decouples `BytesRef`, `Releaseable`, and `TimeValue` from
XContentBuilder, and paves the way for doupling `ByteSizeValue` as well. It
moves much of the Lucene and Joda encoding into a new SPI extension that is
loaded by XContentBuilder to know how to encode these values.

Part of doing this also allows us to make JSON encoding strict, as we no longer
allow just any old object to be passed (in the past it was possible to get json
that was `"field": "java.lang.Object@d8355a8"` if no one was careful about what
was passed in).
