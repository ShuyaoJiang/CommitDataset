Preserve REST client auth despite 401 response (#30558)

The default behaviour for Apache HTTP client is to mimic the standard
browser behaviour of clearing the authentication cache (for a given
host) if that host responds with 401.
This behaviour is appropriate in a interactive browser environment
where the user is given the opportunity to provide alternative
credentials, but it is not the preferred behaviour for the ES REST
client.

X-Pack may respond with a 401 status if a request is made before the
node/cluster has recovered sufficient state to know how to handle the
provided authentication credentials - for example the security index
need to be recovered before we can authenticate native users.
In these cases the correct behaviour is to retry with the same
credentials (rather than discarding those credentials).
