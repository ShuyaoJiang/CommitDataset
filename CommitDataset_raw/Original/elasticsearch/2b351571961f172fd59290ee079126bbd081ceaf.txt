SQL: Add multi_value_field_leniency inside FieldHitExtractor (#40113)

For cases where fields can have multi values, allow the behavior to be
customized through a dedicated configuration field.
By default this will be enabled on the drivers so that existing datasets
work instead of throwing an exception.
For regular SQL usage, the behavior is false so that the user is aware
of the underlying data.
