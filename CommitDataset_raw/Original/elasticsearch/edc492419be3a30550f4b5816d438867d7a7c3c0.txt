Add latch countdown on failure in CCR license tests (#33548)

We have some listeners in the CCR license tests that invoke Assert#fail
if the onSuccess method for the listener is unexpectedly invoked. This
can leave the main test thread hanging until the test suite times out
rather than failing quickly. This commit adds some latch countdowns so
that we fail quickly if these cases are hit.
