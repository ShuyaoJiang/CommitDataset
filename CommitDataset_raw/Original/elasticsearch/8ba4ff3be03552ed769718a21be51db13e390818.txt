Build: Move javadoc linking to root build.gradle (#26529)

Javadoc linking between projects currently relies on
projectSubstitutions. However, that is an extension variable that is not
part of BuildPlugin. This commit moves the javadoc linking into the root
build.gradle, alongside where projectSubstitutions are defined.
