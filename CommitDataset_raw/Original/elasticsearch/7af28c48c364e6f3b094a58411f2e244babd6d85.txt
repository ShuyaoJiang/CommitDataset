Switch WritePipelineResponse to AcknowledgedResponse (#32722)

We previously discussed moving the classes extending `AcknowledgedResponse` to
simply use `AcknowledgedResponse`, making the class non-abstract.

This moves the first class to do this, removing `WritePipelineResponse` in the
process.

If we like the way this looks, I will switch the remaining classes over to using
`AcknowledgedResponse`.
