Remove with(out)-system-key tests (#40547)

This change removes the variants of the rolling upgrade and full
cluster restart tests that use or do not use a system key. These tests
were added during 5.x when the system key was still used for security
and now the system key is only used as the watcher encryption key so
duplicating rolling upgrade and full cluster restarts is not needed.

The change here removes the subprojects for testing these scenarios and
defaults to always run with the watcher sensitive values encrypted for
these tests.
