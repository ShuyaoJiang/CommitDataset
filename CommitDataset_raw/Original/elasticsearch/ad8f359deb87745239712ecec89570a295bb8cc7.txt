Register ip_range aggregation with the high level client (#26383)

The parser for the `ip_range` aggregation response is currently missing from the
NamedXContentRegistry in the high level rest client. Also changes the testing
around the expected number of parsers so we at least check that we register all
the parsers that we also test in InternalAggregationTestCase.
