Use the underlying connection version for CCS connections  (#28093)

Previously this would default to the version of the remote Node.
However, if the remote cluster was mixed-version (e.g. it was part way through a
rolling upgrade), then the TransportService may have negotiated a connection
version that is not identical to connected Node's version.

This mismatch would cause the Stream and the (Remote)Connection to report
different version numbers, which could cause data to be sent over the wire
using an incorrect serialization version.
