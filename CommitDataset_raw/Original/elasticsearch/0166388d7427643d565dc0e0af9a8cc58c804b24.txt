Use single netty event loop group for transports (#35181)

Currently we create a new netty event loop group for client connections
and all server profiles. Each new group creates new threads for io
processing. This means 2 * num of processors new threads for each group.
A single group should be able to handle all io processing (for the
transports). This also brings the netty module inline with what we do
for nio.

Additionally, this PR renames the worker threads to be the same for
netty and nio.
