[CCR] Only auto follow indices when all primary shards have started (#35814)

This change adds an extra check that verifies that all primary shards
have been started of an index that is about to be auto followed.

If not all primary shards have been started for an index
then the next auto follow run will try to follow to auto follow
this index again.

Closes #35480
