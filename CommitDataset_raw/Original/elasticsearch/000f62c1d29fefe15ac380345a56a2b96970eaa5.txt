TEST: makes sure to corrupt referenced tlog files (#27546)

Method TruncateTranslogIT#corruptTranslogFiles corrupts some random
existing *.tlog files in a translog directory. However, this may not
actually corrupt translog at all if it corrupts only tlog files which
are not referenced by the Checkpoint (eg. their translog generations are
smaller the Checkpoint).

This commit makes sure that we corrupt some tlog files which are
referenced by the Checkpoint.

Closes #27538
