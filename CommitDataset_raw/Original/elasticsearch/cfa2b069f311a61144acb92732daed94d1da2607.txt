Use correct cluster state version for node fault detection (#30810)

Since its introduction in ES 1.4, node fault detection has been using the wrong cluster state version to send
as part of the ping request, by using always the constant -1 (ClusterState.UNKNOWN_VERSION). This can, in an
unfortunate series of events, lead to a situation where a previous stale master can regain its authority and
revert the cluster to an older state.

This commit makes NodesFaultDetection use the correct current cluster state for sending ping requests, avoiding
the situation where a stale master possibly forces a newer master to step down and rejoin the stale one.
