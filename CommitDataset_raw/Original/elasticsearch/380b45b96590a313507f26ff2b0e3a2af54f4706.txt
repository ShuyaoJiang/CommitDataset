Improve docs for search preferences (#32159)

Today it is unclear what guarantees are offered by the search preference
feature, and we claim a guarantee that is stronger than what we really offer:

> A custom value will be used to guarantee that the same shards will be used
> for the same custom value.

This commit clarifies this documentation.

Forward-port of #32098 to `master`.
