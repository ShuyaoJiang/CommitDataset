Core: Abstract DateMathParser in an interface (#33905)

This commits creates a DateMathParser interface, which is already
implemented for both joda and java time. While currently the java time
DateMathParser is not used, this change will allow a followup which will
create a DateMathParser from a DateFormatter, so the caller does not
need to know the internals of the DateFormatter they have.
