Allow build to directly run under JDK 9 (#25859)

With Gradle 4.1 and newer JDK versions, we can finally invoke Gradle directly using a JDK9 JAVA_HOME without requiring a JDK8 to "bootstrap" the build. As the thirdPartyAudit task runs within the JVM that Gradle runs in, it needs to be adapted now to be JDK9 aware.

This commit also changes the `JavaCompile` tasks to only fork if necessary (i.e. when Gradle's JVM and JAVA_HOME's JVM differ).
