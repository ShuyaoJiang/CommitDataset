SQL: Teach the CLI to ignore empty commands (#30265)

Cause the CLI to ignore commands that are empty or consist only of
newlines. This is a fairly standard thing for SQL CLIs to do.

It looks like:
```
sql> ;
sql>
   |
   | ;
sql> exit;
Bye!
```

I think I *could* have implemented this with a `CliCommand` that throws
out empty string but it felt simpler to bake it in to the `CliRepl`.

Closes #30000
