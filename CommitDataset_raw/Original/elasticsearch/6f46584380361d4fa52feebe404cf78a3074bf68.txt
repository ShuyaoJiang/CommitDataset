[ML] Add docs for ML info endpoint (#35783)

This endpoint was not previously documented as it was not
particularly useful to end users.  However, since the HLRC
will support the endpoint we need some documentation to
link to.

The purpose of the endpoint is to provide defaults and
limits used by ML.  These are needed to fully understand
configurations that have missing values because the missing
value means the default should be used.
