Fix merging of text field mapper (#40627)

On mapping updates the `text` field mapper does not update
the field types for the underlying prefix and phrase fields.
In practice this shouldn't be considered as a bug but we have
an assert in the code that check that field types in the mapper service
are identical to the ones present in field mappers.
