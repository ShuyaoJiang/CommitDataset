Deprecate HLRC EmptyResponse used by security (#37540)

The EmptyResponse is essentially the same as returning a boolean, which
is done in other places. This commit deprecates all the existing
EmptyResponse methods and creates new boolean methods that have method
params reordered so they can exist with the deprecated methods. A
followup PR in master will remove the existing deprecated methods, fix
the parameter ordering and deprecate the incorrectly ordered parameter
methods.
