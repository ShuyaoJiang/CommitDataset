add debug logging to SimpleClusterStateIT#testIndicesOptions (#38752)

testIndicesOptions fails sometimes because not all indices
are closed in time before the next cluster-state assertion.
This change adds debug logging to the close action, as well
as its calls out to the MetaDataIndexStateService. This should
help understand why things failed, next time they do.

relates to #38745.
