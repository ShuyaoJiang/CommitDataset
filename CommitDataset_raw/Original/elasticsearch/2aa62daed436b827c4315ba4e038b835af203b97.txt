Introduce resizable inbound byte buffer (#27551)

This is related to #27563. In order to interface with java nio, we must
have buffers that are compatible with ByteBuffer. This commit introduces
a basic ByteBufferReference to easily allow transferring bytes off the
wire to usage in the application.

Additionally it introduces an InboundChannelBuffer. This is a buffer
that can internally expand as more space is needed. It is designed to
be integrated with a page recycler so that it can internally reuse pages.
The final piece is moving all of the index work for writing bytes to a
channel into the WriteOperation.
