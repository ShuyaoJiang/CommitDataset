Migrate RecoveryFromGatewayIT to Zen2 (#37520)

* Fixes `testTwoNodeFirstNodeCleared` by manipulating voting config exclusions.

* Removes `testRecoveryDifferentNodeOrderStartup` since state recovery is now
  handled entirely on the elected master, so the order in which the data nodes
  start is irrelevant.
