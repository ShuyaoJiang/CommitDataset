Unify Settings xcontent reading and writing (#26739)

This change adds a fromXContent method to Settings that allows to read
the xcontent that is produced by toXContent. It also replaces the entire settings
loader infrastructure and removes the structured map representation. Future PRs will
also tackle the `getAsMap` that exposes the internal represenation of settings for
better encapsulation.
