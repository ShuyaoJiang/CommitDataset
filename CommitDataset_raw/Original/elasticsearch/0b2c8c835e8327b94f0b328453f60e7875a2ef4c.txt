Fix composite aggregation when after term is missing in the shard (#27936)

This change fixes a bug when a keyword term in the `after` key is not present in the shard.
In this case the global ord of the document values are compared with the insertion point of the
`after` keyword and values that are equal to the insertion point should be considered "after" the top value.
