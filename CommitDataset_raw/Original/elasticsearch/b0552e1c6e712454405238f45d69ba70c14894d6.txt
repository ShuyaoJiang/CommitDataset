[Security] Handle cache expiry in token service (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3565)

* [Security] Handle cache expiry in token service

The keyCache on TokenService.KeyAndCache has a 60 minute expiry.
If the token service was idle for more than 60 minutes, the current
key would be expired and it would then fail to generate user tokens.
