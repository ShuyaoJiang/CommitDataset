make DateMathIndexExpressionsIntegrationIT more resilient (#38473)

the internal cluster calls System.nanoTime() and System.currentTimeMillis() during evaluations of requests
that need date-math index resolution. These are not mockable in these tests. As is, executing requests as-is
in these test cases can potentially result in invalid responses when day-boundaries are hit mid test run.

This change makes the test framework ignore failures due to day changes.

Closes #31067.
