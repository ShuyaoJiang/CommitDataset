[Tests] Check QueryProfileShardResult parser robustness for new fields (#25130)

When parsing resonses we should be ignoring any new unknown fields or inner
objects in most cases to be forward compatible with changes in core on the
client side. This change adds test for this for QueryProfileShardResult and
nested substructures and changes the parsing code where necessary to be able to
ignore new fields and objects in the xContent.
