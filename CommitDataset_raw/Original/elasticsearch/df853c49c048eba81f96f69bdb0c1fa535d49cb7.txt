Add a MovingFunction pipeline aggregation, deprecate MovingAvg agg (#29594)

This pipeline aggregation gives the user the ability to script functions that "move" across a window
of data, instead of single data points.  It is the scripted version of MovingAvg pipeline agg.

Through custom script contexts, we expose a number of convenience methods:

 - MovingFunctions.max()
 - MovingFunctions.min()
 - MovingFunctions.sum()
 - MovingFunctions.unweightedAvg()
 - MovingFunctions.linearWeightedAvg()
 - MovingFunctions.ewma()
 - MovingFunctions.holt()
 - MovingFunctions.holtWinters()
 - MovingFunctions.stdDev()

The user can also define any arbitrary logic via their own scripting, or combine with the above methods.
