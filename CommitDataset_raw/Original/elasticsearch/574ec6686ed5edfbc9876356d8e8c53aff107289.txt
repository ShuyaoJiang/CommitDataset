Include realm type in Security Realm setting keys (#30241)

This moves all Realm settings to an Affix definition.
However, because different realm types define different settings
(potentially conflicting settings) this requires that the realm type
become part of the setting key.

Thus, we now need to define realm settings as:

    xpack.security.authc.realms:
      file.file1:
        order: 0

      native.native1:
        order: 1

- This is a breaking change to realm config
- This is also a breaking change to custom security realms (SecurityExtension)
