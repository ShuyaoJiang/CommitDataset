Allow IntegTestClusters to run with FIPS 140 JVMs (#39917)

The changes in #39732 mean that nodes in the IntegTest clusters will
now run with whichever java version is defined as `runtime.java` and
not JAVA_HOME anymore.
This means that these nodes will also run in JVM with fips approved
mode enabled and as such, need to have access to the password for the
BCFKS keystore that is used as the default keystore/truststore.

This change sets the two necessary system properties.

Resolves #39855
