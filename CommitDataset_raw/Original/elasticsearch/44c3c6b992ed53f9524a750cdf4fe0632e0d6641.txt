Watcher: Fix NPE when search input did not contain search body (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1736)

This came up in a forum post. An NPE was raised, when a search input
contained a search that did not contain a body, but just specified
indices or types.

This commit allows for empty bodies, and also makes sure there are
no null pointer exceptions by using empty bytes references otherwise.

In addition a suite scoped integration test was converted to a unit
test.
