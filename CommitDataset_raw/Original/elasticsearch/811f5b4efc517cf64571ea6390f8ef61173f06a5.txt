Do not ignore request analysis/similarity on resize (#30216)

Today when a resize operation is performed, we copy the analysis,
similarity, and sort settings from the source index. It is possible for
the resize request to include additional index settings including
analysis, similarity, and sort settings. We reject sort settings when
validating the request. However, we silently ignore analysis and
similarity settings on the request that are already set on the source
index. Since it is possible to change the analysis and similarity
settings on an existing index, this should be considered a bug and the
sort of leniency that we abhor. This commit addresses this bug by
allowing the request analysis/similarity settings to override the
existing analysis/similarity settings on the target.
