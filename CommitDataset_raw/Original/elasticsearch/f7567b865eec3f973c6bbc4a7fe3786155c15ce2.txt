Improve assertions in testStaleMasterNotHijackingMajority (#36658)

Investigating #36556 was made a little trickier because the feedback from the
failing assertion wasn't very informative, and the messages attached to other
nearby assertions were misleading. This commit improves the feedback from these
assertions and tidies up a few other issues in the test suite.
