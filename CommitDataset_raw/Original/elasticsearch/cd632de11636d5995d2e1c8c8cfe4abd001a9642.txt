Do not resolve addresses in remote connection info (#36671)

The remote connection info API leads to resolving addresses of seed
nodes when invoked. This is problematic because if a hostname fails to
resolve, we would not display any remote connection info. Yet, a
hostname not resolving can happen across remote clusters, especially in
the modern world of cloud services with dynamically chaning
IPs. Instead, the remote connection info API should be providing the
configured seed nodes. This commit changes the remote connection info to
display the configured seed nodes, avoiding a hostname resolution. Note
that care was taken to preserve backwards compatibility with previous
versions that expect the remote connection info to serialize a transport
address instead of a string representing the hostname.
