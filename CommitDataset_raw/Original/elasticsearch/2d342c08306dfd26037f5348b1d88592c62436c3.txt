[Tests] Add unit tests for NestedSortBuilder (#26458)

The new NestedSortBuilder currently is only tested via its use in the other
SortBuilder implementations it can be used in. This adds its own simple unit
test class that at first checks our usual fromXContent parsing, serialization
and hashCode/equals checks. It also adds tests for cases where NestedSortBuilder
is nested in itself and reuses the code for creating randomized instances in the
other SortBuilder tests.

In addition to the tests, this changes the `path` parameter in NestedSortBuilder
to be mandatory and removes the `read` method since it is not really needed.
