Add DEBUG/TRACE logs for LDAP bind (#36028)

Introduces a debug log message when a bind fails and a trace message
when a bind succeeds.

It may seem strange to only debug a bind failure, but failures of this
nature are relatively common in some realm configurations (e.g. LDAP
realm with multiple user templates, or additional realms configured
after an LDAP realm).
