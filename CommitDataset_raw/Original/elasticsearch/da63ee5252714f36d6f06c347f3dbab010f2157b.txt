Correct rebuilt persian analyzer (#38724)

Make substitution of \u200C with a space explicit

The problem with this symbol `\u200C` in a test string, 
that **SHOULD** be substituted with space in the rebuilt Persian analyzer, but it is not.

Correcting this line `"mappings": [ "\\u200C=> "] <1>` to
 `"mappings": [ "\\u200C=>\\u0020"] <1>` in solves the problem.
This change explicitly says to substitute ZWNJ with a space.

Closes #38188
