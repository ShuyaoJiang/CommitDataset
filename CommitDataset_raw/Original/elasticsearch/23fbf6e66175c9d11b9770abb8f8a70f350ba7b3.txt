Completion suggestions to be reduced once instead of twice (#39255)

We have been calling `reduce` against completion suggestions twice, once
in `SearchPhaseController#reducedQueryPhase` where all suggestions get
reduced, and once more in `SearchPhaseController#sortDocs` where we
add the top completion suggestions to the `TopDocs` so their docs can
be fetched. There is no need to do reduction twice. All suggestions can
be reduced in one call, then we can filter the result and pass only the
already reduced completion suggestions over to `sortDocs`. The small
important detail is that `shardIndex`, which is currently used only
to fetch suggestions hits, needs to be set before the first reduction,
hence outside of `sortDocs` where we have been doing it until now.
