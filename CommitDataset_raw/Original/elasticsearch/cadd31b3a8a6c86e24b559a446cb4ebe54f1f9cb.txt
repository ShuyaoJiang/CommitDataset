Make sure range queries are correctly profiled. (#25108)

We introduced a new API for ranges in order to be able to decide whether points
or doc values would be more appropriate to execute a query, but since
`ProfileWeight` does not implement this API, the optimization is disabled when
profiling is enabled.
