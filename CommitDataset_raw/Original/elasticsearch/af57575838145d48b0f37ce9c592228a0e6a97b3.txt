Allow word_delimiter_graph_filter to not adjust internal offsets (#36699)

This commit adds an adjust_offsets parameter to the word_delimiter_graph token filter, defaulting
to true. Most of the time you'd want sub-tokens emitted by this filter to have offsets that are
adjusted to their real position in the token stream; however, some token filters can change the 
length or starting position of a token (eg trim) without changing their offset attributes, and this 
can lead to word_delimiter_graph emitting illegal offsets. Setting adjust_offsets to false in these 
cases will allow indexing again.

Fixes #34741, #33710
