Add a limit for graph phrase query expansion (#34031)

Today query parsers throw TooManyClauses exception when a query creates
too many clauses. However graph phrase queries do not respect this limit.
This change adds a protection against crazy expansions that can happen when
building a graph phrase query. This is a temporary copy of the fix available
in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-8479 but not merged yet.
This logic will be removed when we integrate the Lucene patch in a future
release.
