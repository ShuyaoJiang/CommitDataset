Fix potential NPE in `_cat/shards/` with partial CommonStats (#33858)

Today if we fetch common stats from a shard we might get a partial response
if the shard is closed while we fetch the stats. This causes hard to track and
reproduce NPEs. This change streamlines null checking to ensure we only render
stats we actually received.
