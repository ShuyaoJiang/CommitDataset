Throws ElasticsearchException from cluster state tasks if something
really bad happens

If the `onFailure()` method is called on the cluster state task then
something bad happened that we can't really deal with so this change
throws an ElasticsearchException in that case and the step will be
re-executed when the policy is next triggered. If we can't submit a
cluster state task then we can't move to the error state so there isn't
really anything else we can do here. If the cluster state task fails
like this there are probably bigger issues witht he cluster anyway.
