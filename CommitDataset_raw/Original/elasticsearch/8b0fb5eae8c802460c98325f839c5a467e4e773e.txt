Re-enable OpenLDAP tests and run against vagrant instance (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2121)

This commit re-enables the OpenLDAP tests that were previously running against a one-off instance
in AWS but now run against a vagrant fixture. There were some IntegTests that would run against the
OpenLDAP instance randomly but with this change they no longer run against OpenLDAP. This is ok as
the functionality that is tested by these has coverage elsewhere.
