Don't emit deprecation warnings on calls to the monitoring bulk API. (#39805)

The monitoring bulk API accepts the same format as the bulk API, yet its concept
of types is different from "mapping types" and the deprecation warning is only
emitted as a side-effect of this API reusing the parsing logic of bulk requests.

This commit extracts the parsing logic from `_bulk` into its own class with a
new flag that allows to configure whether usage of `_type` should emit a warning
or not. Support for payloads has been removed for simplicity since they were
unused.

@jakelandis has a separate change that removes this notion of type from the
monitoring bulk API that we are considering bringing to 8.0.
