[Test] Fix DiscoveryNodesTests.testDeltas() (#28361)

The DiscoveryNodes.Delta was changed in #28197. Previous/Master nodes
are now always set in the `Delta` (before the change they were set only
if the master changed) and the `masterChanged()` method is now based on
object equality and nodes ephemeral ids (before the change it was based
on nodes id).

This commit adapts the DiscoveryNodesTests.testDeltas() to reflect the
changes.
