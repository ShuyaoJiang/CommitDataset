Fix Gradle 4.3.1 compatibility for logging (#27382)

The build currently does not work with Gradle 4.3.1 as the Gradle team stopped publishing the gradle-logging dependency to jcenter, starting with 4.3.1 (not sure why). There are two options:

- Add the repository managed by Gradle team (https://repo.gradle.org/gradle/libs-releases-local) to our build
- Use an older version (4.3) of the dependency when running with Gradle 4.3.1.

Not to depend on another external repo, I've chosen solution 2. Note that this solution could break on future versions, but as this is a compileOnly dependency, and the interface we use has been super stable since forever, I don't envision this to be an issue (and easily detected by a breaking build).
