Add support for replicating closed indices (#39499)

Before this change, closed indexes were simply not replicated. It was therefore 
possible to close an index and then decommission a data node without knowing 
that this data node contained shards of the closed index, potentially leading to 
data loss. Shards of closed indices were not completely taken into account when 
balancing the shards within the cluster, or automatically replicated through shard 
copies, and they were not easily movable from node A to node B using APIs like 
Cluster Reroute without being fully reopened and closed again.

This commit changes the logic executed when closing an index, so that its shards 
are not just removed and forgotten but are instead reinitialized and reallocated on 
data nodes using an engine implementation which does not allow searching or
 indexing, which has a low memory overhead (compared with searchable/indexable 
opened shards) and which allows shards to be recovered from peer or promoted 
as primaries when needed.

This new closing logic is built on top of the new Close Index API introduced in 
6.7.0 (#37359). Some pre-closing sanity checks are executed on the shards before 
closing them, and closing an index on a 8.0 cluster will reinitialize the index shards 
and therefore impact the cluster health.

Some APIs have been adapted to make them work with closed indices:
- Cluster Health API
- Cluster Reroute API
- Cluster Allocation Explain API
- Recovery API
- Cat Indices
- Cat Shards
- Cat Health
- Cat Recovery
