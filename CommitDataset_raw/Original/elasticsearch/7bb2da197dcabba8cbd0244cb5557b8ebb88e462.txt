Remove `nGram` and  `edgeNGram` token filter names (#38911)

In #30209 we deprecated the camel case `nGram` filter name in favour of `ngram` and
did the same for `edgeNGram` and `edge_ngram`. Using these names has been deprecated
since 6.4 and is issuing deprecation warnings since then.
I think we can remove these filters in 8.0. In a backport of this PR I would change what was a
dreprecation warning from 6.4. to an error starting with new indices created in 7.0.
