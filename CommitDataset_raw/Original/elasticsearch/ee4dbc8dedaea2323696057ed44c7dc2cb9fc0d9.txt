Split CircuitBreaker-related tests (#31659)

`MemoryCircuitBreakerTests` conflates two test aspects: It tests
individual circuit breakers as well as the circuit breaker hierarchy.
With this commit we split those two aspects into two test classes:

* Tests for individual circuit breakers stay in the current class
* Other tests are moved to `HierarchyCircuitBreakerServiceTests`
