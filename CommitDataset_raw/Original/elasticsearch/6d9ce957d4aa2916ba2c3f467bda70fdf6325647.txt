Drop name from TokenizerFactory (#24869)

Drops `TokenizerFactory#name`, replacing it with
`CustomAnalyzer#getTokenizerName` which is much better targeted at
its single use case inside the analysis API.

Drops a test that I would have had to refactor which is duplicated by
`AnalysisModuleTests`.

To keep this change from blowing up in size I've left two mostly
mechanical changes to be done in followups:
1. `TokenizerFactory` can now be entirely dropped and replaced with
`Supplier<Tokenizer>`.
2. `AbstractTokenizerFactory`'s ctor still takes a `String` parameter
where the name once was.
