Remove dependencies report task dependencies (#31227)

A previous commit tried to add task dependencies for the
:distribution:generateDependenciesReport task so that a user did not
have to run "dependenciesInfo
:distribution:generateDependenciesReport". However this method did not
reliably add all task dependencies due to task ordering issues in
previous versions of Gradle and our build. This commit removes this for
now and a user will continue to have to run "dependenciesInfo
:distribution:generateDependenciesReport".
