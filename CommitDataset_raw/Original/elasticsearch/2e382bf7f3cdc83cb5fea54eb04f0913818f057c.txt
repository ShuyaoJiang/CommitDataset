Disallow dynamic mapping updated in follow shards

I forgot to configure a mapping in the follow shard shard, which caused
a dynamic update (due to type auto creation), but this was ignored.

Subsequent searches in follow index then failed due to a mapping missing.
(The _id couldn't be fetched during fetch phase, because the mapping was missing)

We should at a later stage investigate how to best solve this, but for
know to avoid confusion just fail if a dynamic update happens in a
follow shard.
