Increase the REST test timeout. (#28640)

By default we wait for 30 seconds for nodes to start. Looking at CI,
even for passing builds, the startup time is frequently over 20 seconds
(grep for `#wait (Thread[Task worker for ':',5,main]) completed` in any
console log), which is close to the threshold. This commit sets a
default timeout of 120 seconds instead, so that REST tests are less
likely to hit a timeout.
