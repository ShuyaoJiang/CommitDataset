Make ILM examples larger (#37039)

There are a handful of examples in the ILM documentation that could result in
rolling over indices more quickly than we might normally recommend,
contributing to over-sharding in cases where the examples are copied without
modification. This change makes some numbers bigger to try and avoid this.
