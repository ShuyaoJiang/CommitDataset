MINOR: Drop Redundant Ctx. Check in ScriptService (#33782)

* MINOR: Drop Redundant Ctx. Check in ScriptService

* This check is completely redundant, the expression script
engine will throw anyway (and with a similar message) for
those contexts that it cannot compile. Moreover, the update context
is not the only context that is not suported by the expression engine
at this point so handling the update context separately here makes
no sense.
