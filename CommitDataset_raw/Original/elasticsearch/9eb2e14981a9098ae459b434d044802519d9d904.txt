Watcher: Ensure watcher thread pool size is reasonably bound (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3056)

The watcher threadpool size was always five times the CPU core
count, resulting in a huge threadpool when with even 24 cores.

This changes the behaviour to be five times the number of cores
by default - as watcher is usually waiting on I/O you should have more
threads than cores, but it maxes out with 50 threads, unless the number
of available cores is higher than that.
