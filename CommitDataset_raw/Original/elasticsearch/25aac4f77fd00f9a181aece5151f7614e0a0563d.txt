Remove `include_type_name` in asciidoc where possible (#37568)

The "include_type_name" parameter was temporarily introduced in #37285 to facilitate
moving the default parameter setting to "false" in many places in the documentation
code snippets. Most of the places can simply be reverted without causing errors.
In this change I looked for asciidoc files that contained the
"include_type_name=true" addition when creating new indices but didn't look
likey they made use of the "_doc" type for mappings. This is mostly the case
e.g. in the analysis docs where index creating often only contains settings. I
manually corrected the use of types in some places where the docs still used an
explicit type name and not the dummy "_doc" type.
