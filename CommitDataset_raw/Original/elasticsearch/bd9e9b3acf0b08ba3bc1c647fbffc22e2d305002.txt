Geo Point parse error fix (#40447)

When geo point parsing threw a parse exception, it did not consume
remaining tokens from the parser. This in turn meant that
indexing documents with malformed geo points into mappings with
ignore_malformed=true would fail in some cases, since DocumentParser
expects geo_point parsing to end on the END_OBJECT token.
