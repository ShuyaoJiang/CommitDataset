Update x-pack for change to channel tracking (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3261)

This commit updates x-pack to be compatible with
elastic/elasticsearch#27711. That commit removed the need for channels
to be internally tracked inside transport implementations. This commit
removes a test mocking class that is not necessary after that change.
