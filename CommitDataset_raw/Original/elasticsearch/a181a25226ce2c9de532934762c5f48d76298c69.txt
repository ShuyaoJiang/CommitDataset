[CCR] Add time since last auto follow fetch to auto follow stats (#36542)

For each remote cluster the auto follow coordinator, starts an auto
follower that checks the remote cluster state and determines whether an
index needs to be auto followed. The time since last auto follow is
reported per remote cluster and gives insight whether the auto follow
process is alive.
