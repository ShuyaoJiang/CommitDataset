Make NodeInfo#nodeVersion strongly-typed as Version (#29515)

Today we have a nodeVersion property on the NodeInfo class that we use
to carry around information about a standalone node that we will start
during tests. This property is a String which we usually end up parsing
to a Version anyway to do various checks on it. This can end up
happening a lot during configuration so it would be more efficient and
safer to have this already be strongly-typed as a Version and parsed
from a String only once for each instance of NodeInfo. Therefore, this
commit makes NodeInfo#nodeVersion strongly-typed as a Version.
