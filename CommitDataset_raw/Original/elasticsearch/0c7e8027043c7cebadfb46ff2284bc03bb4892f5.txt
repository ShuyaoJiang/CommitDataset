[Monitoring] Allow Cluster Alerts to be disabled in LocalExporter (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1808)

You can now disable cluster alerts in the local exporter, which you can do in the HTTP exporter already.

This helps users that mess up their watcher configuration (e.g., disabling scripts) can turn off the feature to avoid log spam.
