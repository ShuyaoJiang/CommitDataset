fielddata: Binary script doc values should make a deep copy of the BytesRef before populating it in the values array.

Added common base class for ScriptDocValues.Strings and ScriptDocValues.BytesRefs now that these classes are very similar.

Also cleaned up the BinaryDVFieldDataTests:
* Use junit assertions instead of hamcrest
* Use BytesRef directly instead of byte[]

Closes #24785
