Early termination with index sorting should not set terminated_early in the response (#26597)

Early termination with index sorting always return the best top N in the response but set the flag `terminated_early`
in the response. This can be confusing because we use the same flag for `terminate_after` which on the contrary returns partial results.
This change removes the flag when results are not partial (early termination due to index sorting) and keeps it only when `terminate_after` is used.

Closes #26408
