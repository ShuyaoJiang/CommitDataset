Add package pre-install check for java binary (#31343)

The package installation relies on java being in the path. If java is
not in the path, the tests fail at post-install time. This commit adds a
pre-install check to validate that java exists, and if it fails, the
package is never installed, and thus keeps a system clean, rather than
aborting at post-install and leaving behind a mess.

Closes #29665
