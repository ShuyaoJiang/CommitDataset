[Tests] Remove QueryStringQueryBuilderTests#toQuery class assertions (#32236)

Currently we check that the queries that QueryStringQueryBuilder#toQuery returns
is one out of a list of many Lucene query classes. This list has extended a lot over time,
since QueryStringQueryBuilder can build all sort of queries. This makes the test hard to 
maintain. The recent addition of alias fields which build a BlendedTermQuery show how
easy this test breaks. Also the current assertions doesn't add a lot in terms of catching
errors. This is why we decided to remove this check.

Closes #32234
