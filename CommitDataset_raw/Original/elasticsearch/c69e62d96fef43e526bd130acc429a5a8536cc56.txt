Painless: Add PainlessConstructor (#32447)

PainlessMethod was being used as both a method and a constructor, and while there are 
similarities, there are also some major differences. This allows the reflection objects to be 
stored reducing the number of other pieces of data stored in a PainlessMethod as they are 
now redundant. This temporarily increases some of the code in FunctionRef and 
PainlessDocGenerator as they now differentiate between constructors and methods, BUT 
is also makes the code more maintainable because there aren't checks in several places 
anymore to differentiate.
