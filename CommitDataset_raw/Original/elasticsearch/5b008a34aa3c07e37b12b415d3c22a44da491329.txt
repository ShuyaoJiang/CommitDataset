Ingest node - user agent, move device to an object (#38115)

When the ingest node user agent parses the device field, it
will result in a string value. To match the ecs schema
this commit moves the value of the parsed device to an
object with an inner field named 'name'. There are not
any passivity concerns since this modifies an unreleased change.
