[ML] Account for the possibility of no ML metadata existing (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1648)

We try to install empty ML metadata as soon as possible after startup
if none exists.  However, this still leaves a short gap when the cluster
is active with no ML metadata.  To avoid problems, functions that use
the ML metadata should treat this situation as equivalent to having
empty ML metadata.
