Add ingest-attachment support for per document `indexed_chars` limit (#28977)

We today support a global `indexed_chars` processor parameter. But in some cases, users would like to set this limit depending on the document itself.
It used to be supported in mapper-attachments plugin by extracting the limit value from a meta field in the document sent to indexation process.

We add an option which reads this limit value from the document itself
by adding a setting named `indexed_chars_field`.

Which allows running:

```
PUT _ingest/pipeline/attachment
{
  "description" : "Extract attachment information. Used to parse pdf and office files",
  "processors" : [
    {
      "attachment" : {
        "field" : "data",
        "indexed_chars_field" : "size"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Then index either:

```
PUT index/doc/1?pipeline=attachment
{
  "data": "BASE64"
}
```

Which will use the default value (or the one defined by `indexed_chars`)

Or

```
PUT index/doc/2?pipeline=attachment
{
  "data": "BASE64",
  "size": 1000
}
```

Closes #28942
