Watcher: Prevent question mark in HttpClient with empty params (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4206)

The HTTPClient in watcher always appended a question mark at the end of
an URL, regardless if parameters were used or not. This commit adds a
check to only pass valid parameters to the URI construction.
