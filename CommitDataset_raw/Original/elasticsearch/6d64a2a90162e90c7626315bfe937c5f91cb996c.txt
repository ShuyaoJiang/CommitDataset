Propagate Errors in executors to uncaught exception handler (#36137)

This is a continuation of #28667 and has as goal to convert all executors to propagate errors to the
uncaught exception handler. Notable missing ones were the direct executor and the scheduler. This
commit also makes it the property of the executor, not the runnable, to ensure this property. A big
part of this commit also consists of vastly improving the test coverage in this area.
