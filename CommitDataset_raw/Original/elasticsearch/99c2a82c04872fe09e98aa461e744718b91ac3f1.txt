[ML] Move analyzer dependencies out of categorization config (#32123)

The ML config classes will shortly be moved to the X-Pack protocol
library to allow the ML APIs to be moved to the high level REST
client.  Dependencies on server functionality should be removed
from the config classes before this is done.

This change is entirely about moving code between packages.  It
does not add or remove any functionality or tests.
