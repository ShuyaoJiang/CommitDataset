[ML] Allow closing a job that is restoring state (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1746)

This change enables closing a job while it is in
the middle of restoring its state. This is has the
benefit of allowing users to close jobs that due to
relocation are `opened` but they are still restoring
state. It also helps avoiding race conditions in tests.

Part of this change also includes restoring the state
as a separate step from the process creation. This means
we no longer block the job map while the process is
restoring its state.
