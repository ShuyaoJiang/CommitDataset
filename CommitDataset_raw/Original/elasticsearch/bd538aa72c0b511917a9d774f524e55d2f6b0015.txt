Ignore JVM options before checking Java version

Today we strip some ignored JVM options before starting the main Java
process (e.g., we unset JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS, and we ignore
JAVA_OPTS). However, there is another Java process that we start before
starting the main process: the Java version checker. We are currently
starting this before ignoring the undesired JVM options so the Java
version checker will pick up JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS and it will silently
ignore JAVA_OPTS. Instead, we should ignore JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS here too,
and not silently ignore JAVA_OPTS but instead warn before doing so (as
we already do for the main Java process). This commit rearranges the
execution of these steps so that we do the right thing here.
