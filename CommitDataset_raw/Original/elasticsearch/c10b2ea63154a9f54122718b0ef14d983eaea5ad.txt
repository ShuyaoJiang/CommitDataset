[ML] Ensure job is not assigned to node that cannot read model_snapshot (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4091)

This adds a minimum compatible version to the model snapshot.
Nodes with a version earlier than that version cannot read
that model snapshot. Thus, such jobs are not assigned to
incompatible nodes.
