Add "request.id" to file audit logs  (#35536)

This generates a synthesized "id" for each incoming request that is
included in the audit logs (file only).
This id can be used to correlate events for the same request (e.g.
authentication success with access granted).

This request.id is specific to the audit logs and is not used for any
other purpose

The request.id is consistent across nodes if a single request requires
execution on multiple nodes (e.g. search acros multiple shards).
