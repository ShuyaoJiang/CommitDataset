Only fsync global checkpoint if needed

In the global checkpoint sync action, we fsync the translog. However,
the last synced global checkpoint might already be equal to the current
global checkpoint in which case the fsyncing the translog is unnecessary
as either the sync needed guard in the translog will skip the translog,
or the translog needs an fsync for another reason that will be picked up
elsewhere (e.g., at the end of a bulk request).
