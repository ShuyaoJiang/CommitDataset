Watcher: Remove broken tests (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4399)

These tests test actually watcher 6.x features and are not needed in the
master branch anymore, as there is no way that watcher is running on the
master node only in Elaticsearch 7.x.

Original commit: elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch@ac5b9339944eccea65814ce2adf3e29d3f10e1e7
