SCRIPTING: Terms set query expression (#33856)

* SCRIPTING: Add Expr. Compile for TermSetQuery Ctx.

* Follow up to #33602 adding the ability to compile TermsSetQuery
scripts with the expressions engine in the same way we support
SearchScript in Expressions
   * Duplicated the code here for now to make the change less complex,
 the only difference to SearchScript is that `_score` and `_value` are not handled for TermsSetQuery
* remove redundant check
