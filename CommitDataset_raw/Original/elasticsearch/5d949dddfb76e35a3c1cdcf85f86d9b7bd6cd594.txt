Docs: Drop inline callout from scroll example (#38340)

Coalesces two calls into one in a scroll example so all callouts are at
the end of the line. This is the only sort of callouts that are
supported by asciidoctor and we'd like to start building our docs with
asciidoctor.

At present we don't have any mechanism to stop folks adding more inline
callouts but we ought to be able to have one in a few weeks. For now,
though, removing these inline callouts is a step in the right direction.
