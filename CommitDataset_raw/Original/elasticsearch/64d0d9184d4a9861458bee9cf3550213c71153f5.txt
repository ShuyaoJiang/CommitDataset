Fix IndexShardIT#testDurableFlagHasEffect to only test if operations have been synced

With global checkpoints we also take into account if a global checkpoint must be fsynced.
Yet, with recent addition of inlining global checkpoints into indexing operations from a
test perspective unnecessary fsyncs might be reported if `Translog#syncNeeded` is checked.
Now the test only check if the last write location triggers an fsync instead.

Closes #24600
