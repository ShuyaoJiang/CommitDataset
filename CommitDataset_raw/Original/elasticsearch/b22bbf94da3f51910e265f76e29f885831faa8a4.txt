Avoid blocking on channel close on network thread (#25521)

Currently when we close a channel in Netty4Utils.closeChannels we
block until the closing is complete. This introduces the possibility
that a network selector thread will block while waiting until a
separate network selector thread closes a channel.

For instance: T1 closes channel 1 (which is assigned to a T1 selector).
Channel 1's close listener executes the closing of the node. That
means that T1 now tries to close channel 2. However, channel 2 is
assigned to a selector that is running on T2. T1 now must wait until T2
closes that channel at some point in the future.

This commit addresses this by adding a boolean to closeChannels
indicating if we should block on close. We only set this boolean to true
if we are closing down the server channels at shutdown. This call is
never made from a network thread. When we call the closeChannels method
with that boolean set to false, we do not block on close.
