TEST: Disable merges in testRebuildLocalCheckpointTracker (#36625)

In this test, we keep track of a list of index commits then verify that
we reload exactly every operation from the safe commit. If a background
merge is triggered, then we might have a new index commit which is not
recorded in the tracking list. This change disables merges in the test.

Closes #36470
