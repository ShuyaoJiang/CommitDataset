Add licensing enforcement for FIPS mode (#32437)

This commit adds licensing enforcement for FIPS mode through the use of
a bootstrap check, a node join validator, and a check in the license
service. The work done here is based on the current implementation of
the TLS enforcement with a production license.

The bootstrap check is always enforced since we need to enforce the
licensing and this is the best option to do so at the present time.
