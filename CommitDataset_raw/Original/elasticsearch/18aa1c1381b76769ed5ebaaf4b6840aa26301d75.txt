add start trial API to HLRC (#33406)

Introduces client-specific request and response classes that do not
depend on the server

The `type` parameter is named `licenseType` in the response class to be
more descriptive. The parts that make up the acknowledged-required
response are given slightly different names than their server-response
types to be consistent with the naming in the put license API

Tests do not cover all cases because the integ test cluster starts up
with a trial license - this will be addressed in a future commit
