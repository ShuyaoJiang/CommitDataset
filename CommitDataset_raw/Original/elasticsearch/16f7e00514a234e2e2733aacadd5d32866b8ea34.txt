Improve testTransportStatsWithException test (#28554)

This commit modifies the transport stats with exception test to remove
the requirement that we calculate the published address size when
comparing bytes received. This is tricky and is currently broken as we
also place the address string in the transport exception, however we do
not adjust the bytes for that.

The solution in this commit is to just serialize the transport exception
in the test and use that for the calculation.
