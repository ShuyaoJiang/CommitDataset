Clarify the use of sleep in CCR test

Sleeps in tests smell funny, and we try to avoid them to the extent
possible. We are using a small one in a CCR test. This commit clarifies
the purpose of that sleep by adding a comment explaining it. We also
removed a hard-coded value from the test, that if we ever modified the
value higher up where it was set, we could end up forgetting to change
the value here. Now we ensure that these would move in lock step if we
ever maintain them later.
