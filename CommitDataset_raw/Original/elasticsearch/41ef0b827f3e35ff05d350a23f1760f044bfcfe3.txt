[ML] Add a write alias for persisting job results (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1636)

This commit switches over to two index aliases per job: one for reading
and one for writing.  In the future this will allow the addition of a
rollover endpoint for ML results indices.  (Rollover is still not possible
following this change, but the change to make it possible in the future
should not be a breaking change now.)
