Core: Remove RequestBuilder from Action (#30966)

This commit removes the RequestBuilder generic type from Action. It was
needed to be used by the newRequest method, which in turn was used by
client.prepareExecute. Both of these methods are now removed, along with
the existing users of prepareExecute constructing the appropriate
builder directly.
