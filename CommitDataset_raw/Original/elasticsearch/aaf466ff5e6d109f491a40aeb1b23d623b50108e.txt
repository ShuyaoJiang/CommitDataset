Revert transport.port change for tests (#36809)

Commit #36786 updated docs and strings to reference transport.port instead of
transport.tcp.port. However, this breaks backwards compatibility tests
as the tests rely on string configurations and transport.port does not
exist prior to 6.6. This commit reverts the places were we reference
transport.tcp.port for tests. This work will need to be reintroduced in
a backwards compatible way.
