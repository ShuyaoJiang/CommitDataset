Increase the maximum number of filters that may be in the cache. (#30655)

We added this limit because we occasionally saw cases where most of the memory
usage of the cache was spent on the keys (ie. queries) rather than the values,
which caused the cache to vastly underestimate its memory usage. In recent
releases, we disabled caching on heavy `terms` queries, which were the main
source of the problem, so putting more entries in the cache should be safer.
