Apply `ignore_throttled` also to concrete indices (#35335)

Today we only apply `ingore_throttled` to expansions from wildcards,
date math expressions and aliases. Yet, this is tricky since we might
have resolved certain expressions in pre-filter steps like security.
It's more consistent to apply this logic to all expressions including
concrete indices.
