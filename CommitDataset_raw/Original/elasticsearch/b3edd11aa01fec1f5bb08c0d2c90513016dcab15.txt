Allow plugins to plug rescore implementations (#26368)

This allows plugins to plug rescore implementations into
Elasticsearch. While this is a fairly expert thing to do I've
done my best to point folks to the QueryRescorer as one that at
least documents the tradeoffs that it makes. I've attempted to
limit the API surface area by removing `SearchContext` from the
exposed interface, instead exposing just the IndexSearcher and
`QueryShardContext`. I also tried to make some of the class names
more consistent and do some general cleanup while I was there.

I entertained the notion of moving the `QueryRescorer` to module.
After all, it'd be a wonderful test to prove that you can plug
rescore implementation into Elasticsearch if the only built in
rescore implementation is in the module. But I decided against it
because the new module would require a client jar and it'd require
moving some more things around. I think if we really want to do
it, we should do it as a followup.

I did, on the other hand, create an "example" rescore plugin which
should both be a nice example for anyone wanting to plug in their
own rescore implementation and servers as a good integration test
to make sure that you can indeed plug one in.
