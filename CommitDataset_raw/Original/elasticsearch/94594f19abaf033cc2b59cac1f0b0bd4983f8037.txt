Fix handling of mandatory meta plugins

This commit fixes an issue with setting plugin.mandatory to include a
meta-plugin. The issue here is that the names that we collect are the
underlying plugins, not the meta-plugin. We should not use the
underlying plugins instead using the names of non-meta plugins and the
names of meta-plugins. This commit addresses this. The strategy here is
that when we look at the installed plugins on the filesystem, we keep
track of which ones are meta-plugins and carry this information up to
where check which plugins are installed against the mandatory plugins.
