Build: Change test task sanity check to be per project (#33544)

This commit changes the sanity check which ensures the test task was
properly replaced with randomized testing to have a per project check,
isntead of a global one. The previous global check assumed all test
tasks within the root project and below should be randomized testing,
but that is not the case for a multi project in which only one project
is an elasticsearch plugin. While the new check is not able to emit all
of the failed replacements in one error message, the efficacy of the
check remains.
