Relax remote check for bwc project checkouts (#28666)

The remote check previously validated both the remote name and the
repository as well, meaning that if someone passed in a repository that
was not a github URL, it would fail. This meant that it was not possible
to fully test bwc out with multiple branches without first pushing to a
remote. Removing the full check allows a user to pass in the origin
remote as its remote, which is already added as a file based remote to
each bwc snapshot build. This will allow changes to be made locally
across all bwc branches, tested, and then pushed simultaneously.
