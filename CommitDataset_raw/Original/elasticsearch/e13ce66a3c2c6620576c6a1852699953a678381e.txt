[Zen2] Calculate optimal cluster configuration (#33924)

We wish to commit a cluster state update after having received a response from
more than half of the master-eligible nodes in the cluster.  This is optimal:
requiring either more or fewer votes than half harms resilience. For instance
if we have three master nodes then, we want to be able to commit a cluster
state after receiving responses from any two nodes; requiring responses from
all three is clearly not resilient to the failure of any node, and if we could
commit an update after a response from just one node then that node would be
required for every commit, which is also not resilient.

However, this means we must adjust the configuration (the set of voting nodes
in the cluster) whenever a master-eligible node joins or leaves. The
calculation of the best configuration for the cluster is the job of the
Reconfigurator, introduced here.
