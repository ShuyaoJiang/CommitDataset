Core: Remove ThreadPool from base TransportAction (#31492)

Most transport actions don't need the node ThreadPool. This commit
removes the ThreadPool as a super constructor parameter for
TransportAction. The actions that do need the thread pool then have a
member added to keep it from their own constructor.
