Whitelisting / from Circuit Breaker Exception (#32325) (#32666)

When Circuit Breaker has tripped, certain diagnostic requests like
"_cluster/health" succeed where as request to / fails with
503 Service Unavailable. This behavior is observed because of this
commit f32b700 where certain API paths are whitelisted from
Circuit Breaking exception, but / is not whitelisted.
Added / to circuit breaker whitelist so that it can be used for
diagnostic purposes
