Index stale operations to Lucene to have complete history (#29679)

Today, when processing out of order operations, we only add it into
translog but skip adding into Lucene. Translog, therefore, has a
complete history of sequence numbers while Lucene does not.

Since we would like to have a complete history in Lucene, this change
makes sure that stale operations will be added to Lucene as soft-deleted
documents if required.
