Don't omit default values when updating routing exclusions (#33638)

Exclusion setting `cluster.routing.allocation.exclude._host` default value
is an empty string.

When an exclusion setting is sent with a null value the
o.e.c.s.Setting#innerGetRaw API return an empty string (probably to
avoid a NullPointerException to be raised).

The o.e.c.r.a.d.FilterAllocationDecider class is developed to omit
updates of default values for exclusion setting.

That's why a null exclusion setting value is translated to an empty
string which is equals to the exclusion default value which is
configured to be ignored.

A simple fix would be to not omit default values for exclusion setting
and keep the NullPointerException guard. This is the purpose of this
commit.

Closes #32721
