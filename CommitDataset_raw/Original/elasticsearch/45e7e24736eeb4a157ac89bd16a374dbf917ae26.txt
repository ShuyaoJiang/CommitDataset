Restrict Document list access in ParseContext (#29463)

Today we expose a mutable list of documents in ParseContext via
ParseContext#docs(). This, on the one hand places knowledge how
to access nested documnts in multiple places and on the other
allows for potential illegal access to nested only docs after
the docs are reversed. This change restricts the access and
streamlines nested / non-root doc access.
