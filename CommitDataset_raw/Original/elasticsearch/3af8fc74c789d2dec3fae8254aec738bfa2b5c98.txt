Make TransportService more test-friendly (#33869)

Today, TransportService uses System.currentTimeMillis() to get the current time
to report on things like timeouts, and enqueues lambdas for future execution.
However, in tests it is useful to be able to fake out the current time and to
see what all these enqueued lambdas are really for. This change alters the
situation so that we can obtain the time from the more easily-faked
ThreadPool#relativeTimeInMillis(), and implements some friendlier toString()
methods on the various Runnables so we can see what they are later.
