[ML] Increase default limit on ML jobs per node from 10 to 20 (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3141)

Following the changes of elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2975 the hard limit on the number of ML jobs
per node is no longer the only limiting factor.  Additionally there is
now a limit based on the estimated memory usage of the jobs, and this is
expected to provide a more sensible limit that accounts for differing
resource requirements per job.

As a result, it makes sense to raise the default for the hard limit on
the number of jobs, on the assumption that the memory limit will prevent
the node becoming overloaded if an attempt is made to run many large jobs.
Increasing the hard limit will allow more small jobs to be run than was
previously the case by default.

Of course, this change to the default will have no effect for customers
who have already overridden the default in their config files.
