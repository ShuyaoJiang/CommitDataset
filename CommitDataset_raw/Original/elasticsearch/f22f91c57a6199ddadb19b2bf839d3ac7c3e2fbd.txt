Allow multiple unicast host providers (#31509)

Introduces support for multiple host providers, which allows the settings based hosts resolver to be
treated just as any other UnicastHostsProvider. Also introduces the notion of a HostsResolver so
that plugins such as FileBasedDiscovery do not need to create their own thread pool for resolving
hosts, making it easier to add new similar kind of plugins.
