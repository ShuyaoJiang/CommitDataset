HLRest: refactor put_user to utilize `User` object (#35188)

This follows #33552 , when the `_authenticate` API added a new
`User` object for the API's response. This changes the `put_user`
API to also employ a `User` object in the request.
The User object changed slightly.
A bug with put_user only putting/updating enabled (but not disabled)
users has been fixed.
