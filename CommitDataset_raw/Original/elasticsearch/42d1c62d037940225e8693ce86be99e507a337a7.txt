SQL: Nicer failure message one EXISTS (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3384)

We don't support the SQL `EXISTS` keyword. It looks like:
```
SELECT * FROM test WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM foo WHERE test.id =
foo.id)
```

It is basically a `JOIN` that doesn't return columns. Since we don't
support `JOIN`, we don't support `EXISTS`.

This PR improves the error message from "unresolved blah blah blah" to
"EXISTS is not yet supported".
