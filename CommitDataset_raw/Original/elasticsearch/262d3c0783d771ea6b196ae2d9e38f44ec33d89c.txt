Allow engine to recover from translog upto a seqno (#33032)

This change allows an engine to recover from its local translog up to
the given seqno. The extended API can be used in these use cases:

When a replica starts following a new primary, it resets its index to
the safe commit, then replays its local translog up to the current
global checkpoint (see #32867).

When a replica starts a peer-recovery, it can initialize the
start_sequence_number to the persisted global checkpoint instead of the
local checkpoint of the safe commit. A replica will then replay its
local translog up to that global checkpoint before accepting remote
translog from the primary. This change will increase the chance of
operation-based recovery. I will make this in a follow-up.
