Use Correct Enum in Wipe Snapshots Test Method (#40422)

* Mistake was made in #39662
* The response deserialized here is `org.elasticsearch.action.admin.cluster.snapshots.get.GetSnapshotsResponse` which uses `org.elasticsearch.snapshots.SnapshotInfo` which uses `org.elasticsearch.snapshots.SnapshotState` and not the shard state
