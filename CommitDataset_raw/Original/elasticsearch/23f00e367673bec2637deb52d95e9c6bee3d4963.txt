Relax fault detector in some disruption tests (#38101)

Today we use `AbstractDisruptionTestCase` to test the behaviour of things like
master elections in the presence of cluster disruptions. These tests have
rather enthusiastic fault detection settings, detecting a fault if a single
ping fails, with a one-second timeout. Furthermore there are some tests that
assert the identity of the master remains unchanged during some disruption, and
these assertions fail rather often thanks to the overly sensitive fault
detector.

However in a number of these tests the fault detector need not be this
sensitive. This commit moves some such tests into their own test suite and uses
more sensible fault-detection settings to avoid the kind of master instability
that is causing CI failures.

Closes #37699
