Switch to hardcoding Smile as the state format (#28610)

This commit changes the state format that was previously passed in to
`MetaDataStateFormat` to always use Smile. This doesn't actually change the
format, since we have used Smile for writing the format since at least 5.0. This
removes the automatic detection of the state format when reading state, since
any state that could be processed in 6.x and 7.x would already have been written
in Smile format.

This is work towards removing the deprecated methods in the XContent code where
we do automatic content-type detection.
