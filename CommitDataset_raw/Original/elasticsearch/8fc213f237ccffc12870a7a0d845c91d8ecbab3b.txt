INGEST: Move all Pipeline State into IngestService (#32617)

* INGEST: Move all Pipeline State into IngestService

* Moves all pipeline state into the ingest service
   * Retains the existing pipeline store and pipeline execution service as inner classes to make the review easier, they should be flattened out in the next step
   * All tests for these classes were copied (and adapted) to the ingest service tests
* This is a refactoring step to enable a clean implementation of a pipeline processor (See #32473)
