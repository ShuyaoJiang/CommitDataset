fix `GET _ilm` response with uninitialized ILM metadata (#34881)

ILM would return a resource-not-found exception when requesting policies
while the IndexLifecycleMetaData is not initialized. The behavior here
should not be as extreme since it is not the user's fault.

This commit changes the behavior so that it succeeds and returns no policies
when no policy names are explicitely specified, otherwise keep the same behavior
of throwing an exception
