Create snapshot role (#35820)

This commit introduces the `create_snapshot` cluster privilege and
the `snapshot_user` role.
This role is to be used by "cronable" tools that call the snapshot API
periodically without recurring to the `manage` cluster privilege. The
`create_snapshot` cluster privilege is much more limited compared to
the `manage` privilege.

The `snapshot_user` role grants the privileges to view the metadata of
all indices (including restricted ones, i.e. .security). It obviously grants the
create snapshot privilege but the repository has to be created using another
role. In addition, it grants the privileges to (only) GET repositories and
snapshots, but not create and delete them.

The role does not allow to create repositories. This distinction is important
because snapshotting equates to the `read` index privilege if the user has
control of the snapshot destination, but this is not the case in this instance,
because the role does not grant control over repository configuration.
