Serialize top-level pipeline aggs as part of InternalAggregations (#40177)

We currently convert pipeline aggregators to their corresponding
InternalAggregation instance as part of the final reduction phase.
They arrive to the coordinating node as part of QuerySearchResult
objects fom the shards and, despite we may incrementally reduce
aggs (hence we may have some non-final reduce and the final
one later) all the reduction phases happen on the same node.

With CCS minimizing roundtrips though, each cluster performs its
own non-final reduction, and then serializes the results back to
the CCS coordinating node which will perform the final coordination.
This breaks the assumptions made up until now around reductions
happening all on the same node.

With #40101 we have made sure that top-level pipeline aggs are not
reduced as part of the non-final reduction. The next step is to make
sure that they don't get lost, meaning that each coordinating node
needs to send them back to the CCS coordinating node as part of
the top-level `InternalAggregations` object.

Closes #40059
