Move test classes to test root in Painless (#40873)

This moves several test classes that were part of the main root to the test root. 
These were part of the main root due to limitations prior to whitelist 
customization. Without whitelist customization these can be moved to a test 
context and removed from the base whitelists as they should not be user 
facing.
