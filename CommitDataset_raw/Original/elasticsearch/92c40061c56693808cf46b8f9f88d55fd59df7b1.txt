[ML] Skip index health checks for remote indices on datafeed node sel (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3301)

Upon selecting a node to run a datafeed we normally check that the
data indices exists and their primaries are active. However, these
checks cannot be applied for CCS to a remote cluster. This commit
skips these checks for remote indices.

This removes the last obstacle for running CCS datafeeds.
