Avoid double decrement on current query counter

This commit fixes a double decrement bug on the current query
counter. The double decrement arises in a situation when the fetch phase
is inlined for a query that is only touching one shard. After the query
phase succeeds we decrement the current query counter. If the fetch
phase ultimately fails, an exception is thrown and we decrement the
current query counter again in the catch block. We also add assertions
that all current stats counters remain non-negative at all
times.
