Prevent nodes from joining a non-TLS enabled cluster with a production license (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2484)

This change prevents a node from joining a cluster with a production license (gold, platinum, standard) iff the cluster doesn't have TLS setup. This is mainly a BWC oriented change that prevents joining old 5.x clusters without a TLS setup.
