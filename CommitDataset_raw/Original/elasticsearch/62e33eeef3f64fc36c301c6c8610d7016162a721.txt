[TEST] REST client request without leading '/' (#29471)

The following is the current behaviour, tested now through a specific
test.

The low-level REST client doesn't add a leading wildcard when not
provided, unless a `pathPrefix` is configured in which case a trailing
slash will be automatically added when concatenating the prefix and the
provided uri.

Also when configuring a pathPrefix, if it doesn't start with a '/' it
will be modified by adding the missing leading '/'.
