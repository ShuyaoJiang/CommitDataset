Remove assemble from build task when assemble removed

Removes the `assemble` task from the `build` task when we have
removed `assemble` from the project. We removed `assemble` from
projects that aren't published so our releases will be faster. But
That broke CI because CI builds with `gradle precommit build` and,
it turns out, that `build` includes `check` and `assemble`. With
this change CI will only run `check` for projects without an
`assemble`.
