Monitoring: Fix cluster monitoring watches to prevent compilations (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1944)

The monitoring watches are roughly executing the same queries even when
they run against different clusters. However the way they were created,
where the cluster name is replaced via search & replace instead of using
watch metadata implies, that every watch is different from a script
compilation cache perspective. On top of that every of those watches is
executed once a minute. So if a new node becomes master and you monitor
three clusters, this results in a fair share of compilations in the first minute. The
reason for the compilation is the fact, that the search input uses
mustache for being able to add dynamic parts into a search using
mustache.

Several of those watches also need to compile more than one search
request.

The maximum default value for script compilations is only 15 and thus at
least one watch will not be executed due to failing script compilations.

This commit changes the four watches, so that the search requests are
cacheable. This means, no matter how many clusters you monitor, there
will be only needed four compilations for the different watches and
that's it.
