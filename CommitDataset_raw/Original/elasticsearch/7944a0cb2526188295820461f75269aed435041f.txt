Track max seq_no of updates or deletes on primary (#33842)

This PR is the first step to use seq_no to optimize indexing operations.
The idea is to track the max seq_no of either update or delete ops on a
primary, and transfer this information to replicas, and replicas use it
to optimize indexing plan for index operations (with assigned seq_no).

The max_seq_no_of_updates on primary is initialized once when a primary
finishes its local recovery or peer recovery in relocation or being
promoted. After that, the max_seq_no_of_updates is only advanced internally
inside an engine when processing update or delete operations.
