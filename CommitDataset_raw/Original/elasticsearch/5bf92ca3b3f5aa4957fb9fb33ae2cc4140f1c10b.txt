Enforce that java.io.tmpdir exists on startup (#28217)

If the default java.io.tmpdir is used then the startup script creates
it, but if a custom java.io.tmpdir is used then the user must ensure it
exists before running Elasticsearch. If they forget then it can cause
errors that are hard to understand, so this change adds an explicit
check early in the bootstrap and reports a clear error if java.io.tmpdir
is not an accessible directory.
