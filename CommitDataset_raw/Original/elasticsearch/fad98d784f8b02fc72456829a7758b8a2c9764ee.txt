[ML] Align aggregated data extraction to histogram interval (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2553)

When the datafeed uses aggregations and in order to accommodate
derivatives, an extra bucket is queried at the beginning of each
search. In order to avoid visiting the same bucket twice, we need
to search buckets aligned to the histogram interval. This allows
us to steer away from partial buckets, and thus avoid the problem
of dropping or duplicating data.
