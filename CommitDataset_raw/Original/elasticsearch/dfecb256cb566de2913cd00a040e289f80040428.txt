Exit batch files explictly using ERRORLEVEL (#29583)

* Exit batch files explictly using ERRORLEVEL

This makes sure the exit code is preserved when calling the batch
files from different contexts other than DOS

Fixes #29582

This also fixes specific error codes being masked by an explict

exit /b 1

causing the useful exitcodes from ExitCodes to be lost.

* fix line breaks for calling cli to match the bash scripts

* indent size of bash files is 2, make sure editorconfig does the same for bat files

* update indenting to match bash files

* update elasticsearch-keystore.bat indenting

* Update elasticsearch-node.bat to exit outside of endlocal
