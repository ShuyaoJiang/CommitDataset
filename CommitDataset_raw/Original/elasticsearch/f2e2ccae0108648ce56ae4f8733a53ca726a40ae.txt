[ML] Extract parent field when job has text multi-field (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1705)

In the case where a field is a text multi-field, it has
no doc values and it is not in source. Thus, the datafeed
will not be able to extract it.

However, it is possible to extract it by getting its parent
field instead. This commit implements the logic to look
in parent fields when the field in question is a text field.
