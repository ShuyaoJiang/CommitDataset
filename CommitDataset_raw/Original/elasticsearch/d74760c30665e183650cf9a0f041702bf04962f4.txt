GCS Repository: Add secure storage of credentials (#24697)

This commit adds gcs credential settings to the elasticsearch keystore.
The setting name follows the same pattern as the s3 client settings,
beginning with `gcs.client.`, followed by the client name, and then the
setting name, in this case, `credentials_file`. Using the legacy service
file setting is also deprecated.
