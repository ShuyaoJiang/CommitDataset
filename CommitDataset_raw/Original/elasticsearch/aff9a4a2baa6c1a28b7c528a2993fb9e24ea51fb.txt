[ML] Autodetect should receive events from the earliest valid timestamp (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3570)

When events are searched to be passed to the autodetect process, they
are currently calculated based on the latest record timestamp, when
a job opens, and `now` when the process is updated.

This commit changes both to be consistent and based on the earliest
valid timestamp for the job. The earliest valid timestamp is the
latest record timestamp minus the job latency.
