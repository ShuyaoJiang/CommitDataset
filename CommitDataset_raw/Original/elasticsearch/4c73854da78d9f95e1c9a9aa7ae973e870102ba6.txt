SQL: Implement null handling for `IN(v1, v2, ...)` (#34750)

Implemented null handling for both the value tested but also for
values inside the list of values tested against.

The null handling is implemented for local processors, painless scripts
and Lucene Terms queries making it available for `IN` expressions occuring
in `SELECT`, `WHERE` and `HAVING` clauses.

Closes: #34582
