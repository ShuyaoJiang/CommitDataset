[ML] Improve error message when auto-close isn't attempted (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2296)

The old message of "Cannot auto close job" implied the problem was with
closing the job.  This change makes it clearer that the problem is that
the datafeed could not be stopped and hence auto-close will not even be
attempted.
