Support realm validation when Keystore is closed (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3096)

If the KeyStoreWrapper is closed, then we cannot validate secure settings (because we no longer have access to them)
The Realm group setting uses the "validate" method to ensure that child settings are correct, but it must ignore secure settings as it might get called
after startup (e.g. during a settings diff)
