Watcher: Only delete triggered watch if watch was known (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1562)

When a user executes a watch and specifies it as part of the
execute watch API, no triggered watch is created, as the watch
cannot be picked up anymore (it only leaves for the duration of
the request).

However until now the TriggeredWatchStore was invoked and tried
to delete this non-existing triggered watch, resulting in some
log cluttering.

This commit removes this try to delete a non-existing triggered
watch.
