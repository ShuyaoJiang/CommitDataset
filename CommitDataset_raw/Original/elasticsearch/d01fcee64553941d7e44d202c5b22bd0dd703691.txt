Fix illegal cast of the "low cardinality" optimization of the `terms` aggregation. (#27543)

The GlobalOrdinalsStringTermsAggregator.LowCardinality aggregator casts global
values to `GlobalOrdinalMapping`, even though the implementation of global
values is different when a `missing` value is configured.

This commit adds a new API that gives access to the ordinal remapping in order
to fix this problem.
