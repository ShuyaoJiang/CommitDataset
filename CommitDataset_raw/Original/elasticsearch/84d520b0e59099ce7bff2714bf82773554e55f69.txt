Throw an ISE rather than an hard assertion in SearchPhaseController#getTotalHits

This change turns an assertion into an IllegalStateException in SearchPhaseController#getTotalHits.
The goal is to help identify the cause of the failures in https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/37179
which seems to fail only in CI.
The assertion will be restored when the issue is solved (NORELEASE).
