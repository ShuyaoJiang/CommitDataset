Add the ability to define custom inner hit sub context builder (#24676)

This commit moves the handling of nested and parent/child inner hits to specialized classes that can be defined outside of ES core.
InnerHitBuilderContext is now used by the parent query (nested or hasChild, ...) to build the sub context from the InnerHitBuilder definition.
BWC is also ensured so that nodes in previous versions can still send/receive inner hits to/from this version.
