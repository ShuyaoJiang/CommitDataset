Moved tokenizers to analysis common module (#30538)

The following tokenizers were moved: classic, edge_ngram,
letter, lowercase, ngram, path_hierarchy, pattern, thai, uax_url_email and
whitespace.

Left keyword tokenizer factory in server module, because
normalizers directly depend on it.This should be addressed on a
follow up change.

Relates to #23658
