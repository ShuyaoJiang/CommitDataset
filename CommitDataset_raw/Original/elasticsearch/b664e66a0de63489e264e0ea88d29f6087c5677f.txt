Test: Simplify watch stats test script engine (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1520)

This commit simplifies the WatchStatsTests to use a MockScriptPlugin.
The latch script engine previously depended on a static instance of the
engine to contain the latches. These are now moved to statics of the
test class itself.
