Watcher: Fix encoding of UTF8 data in HttpClient (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3398)

The HttpClient uses an Apache HTTP client class named StringEntity to
encode a HTTP request body. This one however assumes ISO-8859-1 as its
charset when encoding the string based body to bytes.

This commit switches to a byte array based body, then sets the content
type header and falls back to the old text/plain content type if no
content type header is specified.
