Maintain order of operations semantics on follower

A following engine even for a primary shard needs to maintain order of
operations semantics as if it were behaving like a replica. That is,
rather than assuming that the order of operations presented to the
engine is the de facto order of operations as is the case for a leader
engine for a primary shard, a following engine must behave like all
replicas behave which is that they resolve order of operations based on
sequence numbers. This commit causes this to be the case for following
engines.
