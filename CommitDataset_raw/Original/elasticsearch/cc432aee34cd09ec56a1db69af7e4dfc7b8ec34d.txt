[ML] Check calendar exists before removing job (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3661)

Also, removes check for whether a job-to-remove exists
and replaces it with a check of whether a job-to-remove
is already present in the calendar. This allows to
remove a job that may no longer exists and it improves
feedback for the case that an existing job is removed from
a calendar that doesn't contain it.
