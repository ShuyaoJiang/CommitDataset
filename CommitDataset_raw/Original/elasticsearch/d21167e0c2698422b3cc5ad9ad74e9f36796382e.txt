[TEST] Remove leftover ES temp directories before Vagrant tests (#27722)

Some of the Vagrant tests were failing due to ES temp directories
left over from previous uses of the same VM confusing subsequent
tests into thinking there were multiple ES installs present.

This change wipes all ES temp directories when the test VMs are
brought up.
