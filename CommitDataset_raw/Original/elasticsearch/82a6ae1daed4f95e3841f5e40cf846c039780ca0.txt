[CCR] Move ccr tests in core module back to ccr module (#33711)

When developing ccr it is not ideal if tests are in multiple modules.
Even the classes these tests test are in the core module, it is easier
if these tests are in ccr module in order to avoid running the test task
in core module. This results in running many non ccr tests.

This way when developing ccr we can run locally:
./gradlew x-pack:plugin:core:precommit x-pack:plugin:ccr:check

before pushing to PR branches and be confident that the PR build passes,
without running x-pack:plugin:core:check task.
