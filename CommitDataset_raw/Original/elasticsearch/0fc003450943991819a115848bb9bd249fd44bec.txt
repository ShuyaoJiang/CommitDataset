Test: remove outdated logic for file writing in security tests (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3947)

This commit removes some outdated logic in the SecurityTestUtils class
for writing files and creating directories. A long, long time ago there
was a global cluster for tests that was used across suites and because
of this there were calls to delete files if they already existed. The
global cluster has been removed, so we no longer need the code that
deletes the content of a directory if it already exists.

Additionally, the file writing used in SecurityTestUtils did not use
atomic moves when possible and this commit changes the code such that a
temp file is written and we try to atomically move it to the correct
path; if atomic moves are not supported a regular move is performed.
