remove recommended junit intellij setting change (#28274)

The "Shorten Command Line" setting in Intellij's JUnit test configuration
was recommended to change to `classpath file`. This setting has been
causing issues with JDK9 where some modules were not being found at
runtime. This PR removes the recommendation to change this setting and
instead asks that users verify that it is set to `user-local default:none`.
