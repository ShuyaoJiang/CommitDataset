Rename SearchRequest#withLocalReduction (#39108)

`withLocalReduction` is confusing as `local` effectively means "local
to the remote clusters" rather than "local the coordinating node" where
the method is executed. I propose we rename the method to
`crossClusterSearch` which better resembles what the static method is
used for.
