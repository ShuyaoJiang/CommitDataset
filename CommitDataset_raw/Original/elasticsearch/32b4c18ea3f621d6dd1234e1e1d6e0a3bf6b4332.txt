[ML] Ensure internal client is used where appropriate (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2415)

Implementation details of ML endpoints should be performed using the
internal client, so that the end user only requires permissions for
the public ML endpoints and does not need to know how they are
implemented.  This change fixes some instances where this rule was
not adhered to.
