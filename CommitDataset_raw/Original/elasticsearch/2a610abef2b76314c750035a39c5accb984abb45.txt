Document that auto_create_index is dynamic (#37903)

We changed the `action.auto_create_index` setting to be a dynamic cluster-level
setting in #20274 but today the reference manual indicates that it is still a
static node-level setting. This commit addresses this, and clarifies the
semantics of patterns that may both permit and forbid the creation of certain
indices.
