Extract a common base class for scroll executions (#24979)

Today there is a lot of code duplication and different handling of errors
in the two different scroll modes. Yet, it's not clear if we keep both of
them but this simplification will help to further refactor this code to also
add cross cluster search capabilities.

This refactoring also fixes bugs when shards failed due to the node dropped out of the cluster in between scroll requests and failures during the fetch phase of the scroll. Both places where simply ignoring the failure and logging to debug. This can cause issues like #16555
