Move CCR REST tests to a sub-project of ccr

This commit moves these REST tests (possibly temporarily) to a
sub-project of ccr. We do this (again, possibly temporarily) to keep
them within the ccr sub-project yet there are changes within 6.x that
prevent these from being in the top-level project (the cluster formation
tasks are trying to install x-pack-ccr into the
integ-test-zip). Therefore, we isolate these for now until we can
understand why there are differences between 6.x and master.
