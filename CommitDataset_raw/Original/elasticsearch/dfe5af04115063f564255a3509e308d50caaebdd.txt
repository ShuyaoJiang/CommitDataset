[ML] Return both Joda and Java formats from structure finder (#33900)

Previously the timestamp_formats field in the response
from the find_file_structure endpoint contained Joda
timestamp formats.  This change makes that clear by
renaming the field to joda_timestamp_formats, and also
adds a java_timestamp_formats field containing the
equivalent Java time format strings.
