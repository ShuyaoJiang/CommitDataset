Switch internal security index to ".security-7" (#39337)

This changes the name of the internal security index to ".security-7",
but supports indices that were upgraded from earlier versions and use
the ".security-6" name.

In all cases, both ".security-6" and ".security-7" are considered to
be restricted index names regardless of which name is actually in use
on the cluster.
