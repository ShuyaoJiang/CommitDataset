Remove deprecation warnings to prepare for Gradle 5 (sourceSets.main.output.classesDirs) (#30389)

* Remove deprecation warnings to prepare for Gradle 5

Gradle replaced `project.sourceSets.main.output.classesDir` of type
`File` with `project.sourceSets.main.output.classesDirs` of type
`FileCollection`
(see [SourceSetOutput](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/master/subprojects/plugins/src/main/java/org/gradle/api/tasks/SourceSetOutput.java))
Build output is now stored on a per language folder.

There are a few places where we use that, here's these and how it's
fixed:

- Randomized Test execution
    - look in all test folders ( pass the multi dir configuration to the
    ant runner )
    - DRY the task configuration by introducing `basedOn` for
      `RandomizedTestingTask` DSL
- Extend the naming convention test to support passing in multiple
  directories
- Fix the standalon test plugin, the dires were not passed trough,
  checked with a debuger and the statement had no affect due to a
  missing `=`.

Closes #30354

* Only check Java tests, PR feedback

- Name checker was ran for Groovy tests that don't adhere to the same
  convections causing the check to fail
- implement PR feedback

* Replace `add` with `addAll`

This worked because the list is passed to `project.files` that does the
right thing.

* Revert "Only check Java tests, PR feedback"

This reverts commit 9bd9389875d8b88aadb50df57a45cd0d2b073241.

* Remove `basedOn` helper

* Bring some changes back

Previus revert accidentally reverted too much

* Fix negation

* add back public

* revert name check changes

* Revert "revert name check changes"

This reverts commit a2800c0b363168339ea65e2a79ec8256e5883e6d.

* Pass all dirs to name check

Only run on Java for build-tools, this is safe because it's a self test.
It needs more work before we could pass in the Groovy classes as well as
these inherit from `GroovyTestCase`

* remove self tests from name check

The self complicates the task setup and disable real checks on
build-tools.
With this change there are no more self tests, and the build-tools tests
adhere to the conventions.
The self test will be replaced by gradle test kit, thus the addition of
the Gradle plugin builder plugin.

* First test to run a Gradle build

* Add tests that replace the name check self test

* Clean up integ test base class

* Always run tests

* Align with test naming conventions

* Make integ. test case inherit from unit test case

The check requires this

* Remove `import static org.junit.Assert.*`
