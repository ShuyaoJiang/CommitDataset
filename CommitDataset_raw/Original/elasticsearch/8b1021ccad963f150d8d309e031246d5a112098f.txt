blacklist two license rest tests when build.snapshot=false (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2559)

There are two rest tests that rely on hardcoded license
signatures that use the dev public key. These tests fail
when tests are run with build.snapshot=false. This Commit
blacklists these two tests in that scenario

relates elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2527.
