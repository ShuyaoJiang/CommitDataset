Test: Remove leftover static bwc test case (#26584)

This test case was leftover from the static bwc tests. There was still
one use for checking we do not load old indices, but this PR moves the
legacy code needed for that directly into the test. I also opened a
follow up issue to completely remove the unsupported test: #26583.
