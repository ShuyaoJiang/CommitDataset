TEST: Clone replicas list when compute replication targets (#34728)

In #34407, we supposed to clone the list of replicas of ReplicationGroup
when computing replication targets, but somehow we missed it. If we
don't clone the list, a WriteReplicationAction may use an old
ReplicationTargets which consists replicas which are removed from the
current list of replicas

Relates #34407
Closes #33457
