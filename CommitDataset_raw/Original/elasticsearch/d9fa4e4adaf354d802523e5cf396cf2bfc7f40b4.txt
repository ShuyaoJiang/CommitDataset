Fix testRelocateWhileContinuouslyIndexingAndWaitingForRefresh (#37560)

This test failed because the refresh at the end of the test is not guaranteed to run before the
indexing is completed, and therefore there's no guarantee that the refresh will free all operations.
This triggers an assertion failure in the test clean-up, which asserts that there are no more pending
operations.
