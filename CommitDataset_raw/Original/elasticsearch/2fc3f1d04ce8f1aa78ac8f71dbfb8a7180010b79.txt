move replicas action functionality into AllocateAction (#32523)

Since replica counts and allocation rules are set separately, it is not always clear how many replicas are to be allocated in the allocate action. Moving the replicas action to occur at the same time as the allocate action, resolves this confusion that could end an undesired state. This means that the ReplicasAction is removed, and a new optional replicas parameter is added to AllocateAction.
