Add date and date_nanos conversion to the numeric_type sort option (#40199)

This change adds an option to convert a `date` field to nanoseconds resolution
 and a `date_nanos` field to millisecond resolution when sorting.
The resolution of the sort can be set using the `numeric_type` option of the
field sort builder. The conversion is done at the shard level and is restricted
to dates from 1970 to 2262 for the nanoseconds resolution in order to avoid
numeric overflow.
