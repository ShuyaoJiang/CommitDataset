Create retention leases file during recovery (#39359)

Today we load the shard history retention leases from disk whenever opening the
engine, and treat a missing file as an empty set of leases. However in some
cases this is inappropriate: we might be restoring from a snapshot (if the
target index already exists then there may be leases on disk) or
force-allocating a stale primary, and in neither case does it make sense to
restore the retention leases from disk.

With this change we write an empty retention leases file during recovery,
except for the following cases:

- During peer recovery the on-disk leases may be accurate and could be needed
  if the recovery target is made into a primary.

- During recovery from an existing store, as long as we are not
  force-allocating a stale primary.
