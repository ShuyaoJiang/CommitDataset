Fix file reading in ccr restore service (#38117)

Currently we use the raw byte array length when calling the IndexInput
read call to determine how many bytes we want to read. However, due to
how BigArrays works, the array length might be longer than the reference
length. This commit fixes the issue and uses the BytesRef length when
calling read. Additionally, it expands the index follow test to index
many more documents. These documents should potentially lead to large
enough segment files to trigger scenarios where this fix matters.
