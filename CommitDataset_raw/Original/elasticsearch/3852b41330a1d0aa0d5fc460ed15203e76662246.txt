[Rollup] Validate field mapping before creating Rollup Job (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4274)

This PR adds logic to ensure that the fields (and field types) configured
in the Rollup Job are present in the index/indices specified by the job's
index pattern.  If a field is missing, or is not aggregatable, it
will throw an exception before the job is created.

This is important for user-friendliness, because otherwise the user
only discovers an issue with mapping when the job is started and
fails to rollup correctly (and only really noticeable by looking at logs,
since it's a runtime failure).
