Drop node if asymmetrically partitioned from master (#39598)

When a node is joining the cluster we ensure that it can send requests to the
master _at that time_. If it joins the cluster and _then_ loses the ability to
send requests to the master then it should be removed from the cluster. Today
this is not the case: the master can still receive responses to its follower
checks, and receives acknowledgements to cluster state publications, so has no
reason to remove the node.

This commit changes the handling of follower checks so that they fail if they
come from a master that the other node was following but which it now believes
to have failed.
