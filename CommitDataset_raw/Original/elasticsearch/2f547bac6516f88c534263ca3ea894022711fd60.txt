Remove deprecated methods from QueryStringQueryBuilder (#35912)

This change removes the deprecated useDisMax() and useAllFields() methods from
the QueryStringQueryBuilder and related tests. The disMax parameter has already
been a no-op since 6.0 and also the useAllFields has been deprecated since 6.0
and there is a direct replacement via defaultField.
