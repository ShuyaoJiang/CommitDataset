REST test for typeless APIs. (#33934)

This commit duplicates REST tests for the
 - `indices.create`
 - `indices.put_mapping`
 - `indices.get_mapping`
 - `index`
 - `get`
 - `delete`
 - `update`
 - `bulk`
APIs, so that we both test them when used without types (include_type_name=false)
and with types, mostly for mixed-version cluster tests.

Given a suite called `X_test_name.yml`, I first copied it to
`(X+1)_test_name_with_types.yml` and then changed `X_test_name.yml` to set
`include_type_name=false` on every API that supports it.
