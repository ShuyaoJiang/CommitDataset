Formal support for "password_hash" in Put User (#35242)

For some time, the PutUser REST API has supported storing a pre-hashed
password for a user. The change adds validation and tests around that
feature so that it can be documented & officially supported.

It also prevents the request from containing both a "password" and a "password_hash".
