Upgrading HDFS Repository Plugin to use HDFS 2.8.1 Client (#25497)

Hadoop 2.7.x libraries fail when running on JDK9 due to the version string changing to a single 
character. On Hadoop 2.8, this is no longer a problem, and it is unclear on whether the fix will be 
backported to the 2.7 branch. This commit upgrades our dependency of Hadoop for the HDFS 
Repository to 2.8.1.
