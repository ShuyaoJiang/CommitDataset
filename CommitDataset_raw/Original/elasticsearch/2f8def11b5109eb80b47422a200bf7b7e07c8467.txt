Coerce decimal strings for whole number types by truncating the decimal part (#25835)

This changes makes it so you can index a value like "1.0" or "1.1" into whole
number field types like byte and integer. Without this change then the above
values would have resulted in an error, even with coerce set to true.

Closes #25819
