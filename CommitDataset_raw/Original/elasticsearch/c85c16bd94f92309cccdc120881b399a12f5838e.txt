Core: Revert back to joda's multi date formatters (#36814)

This commit partially reverts #36447 by using the ability of Joda time's
DateTimeFormatterBuilder to append multiple parsers instead of using the
MergedDateFormatter. The MergedDateFormatter will be removed in a future
change, as it is not as performant due to creating potentially many
exceptions during heavy date parsing. This change is a stop-gap until
that followup is ready.

closes #36602
