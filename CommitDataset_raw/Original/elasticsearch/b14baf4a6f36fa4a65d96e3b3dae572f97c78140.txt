Decouple XContentBuilder from BytesReference (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4119)

* Decouple XContentBuilder from BytesReference

This commit handles the removal of all mentions of BytesReference from
XContentBuilder. This is needed so that we can completely decouple the XContent
code and move it into its own dependency.

This is the x-pack side of https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/28972
