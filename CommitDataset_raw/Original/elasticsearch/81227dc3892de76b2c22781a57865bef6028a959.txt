[Authz] Allow update settings action for system user (#34030)

When the cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.flood_stage watermark
is breached, DiskThresholdMonitor marks the indices as read-only. This
failed when x-pack security was present as system user does not have the privilege
for update settings action("indices:admin/settings/update").
This commit adds the required privilege for the system user. Also added missing
debug logs when access is denied to help future debugging.
An assert statement is added to catch any missed privileges required for
system user.

Closes #33119
