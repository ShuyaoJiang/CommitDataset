[Tests] Simplify GceDiscoverTests (#28726)

GceDiscoverTests can be simplified in a similar manner than #27945. It
now uses a mocked GceInstancesService that exposes internal test cluster
nodes as if they were real GCE nodes. It should also make the test more
robust by not using a HTTP server anymore.

closes #24313
