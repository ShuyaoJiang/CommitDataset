Introduce mapping version to index metadata (#33147)

This commit introduces mapping version to index metadata. This value is
monotonically increasing and is updated on mapping updates. This will be
useful in cross-cluster replication so that we can request mapping
updates from the leader only when there is a mapping update as opposed
to the strategy we employ today which is to request a mapping update any
time there is an index metadata update. As index metadata updates can
occur for many reasons other than mapping updates, this leads to some
unnecessary requests and work in cross-cluster replication.
