[Zen2] Only elect master-eligible nodes (#35996)

Today any node can win an election. However, the whole point of
master-eligibility is that master-ineligible nodes should not be elected as the
leader; furthermore master-ineligible nodes do not have any outgoing STATE
channels so cannot publish cluster states, so their leadership is ineffective
and disruptive.

This change ensures that the elected leader is master-eligible by preventing
master-ineligible nodes from scheduling an election.
