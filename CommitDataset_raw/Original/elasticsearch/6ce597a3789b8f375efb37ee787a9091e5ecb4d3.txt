Scripts: Convert template script engines to return String instead of BytesReference (#24447)

Template script engines (mustache, the only one) currently return a
BytesReference that users must know is utf8 encoded. This commit
modifies all callers and mustache to have the template engine return
String. This is much simpler, and does not require decoding in order to
use (for example, in ingest).
