[TEST] Add some ACL yaml tests for Rollup (#33035)

These two tests compliment the existing unit tests which check Rollup's
ACL/security integration.

The first test creates to indices, puts a document in each one, and then
assigns a role to the test user that can only access one of the indices.
A rollup job is created with a pattern that would match both indices,
and we verify that only the allowed document was rolled up (e.g. verifying
that the unpermissioned index stays hidden).

The second test creates a single index with two documents tagged by
the keyword "public"/"private".  An attribute-based role is created
that only allows viewing "public" documents.  We then verify the rollup
job only rolled the "public" doc, and not the "private" one.
