Disable console logging in the Windows service

When Elasticsearch is run as a service we should not use the console
logger otherwise we end up duplicating logging (to the Elasticsearch
logs and whereever standard output is captured). Previously we disabled
the console logger when started as a service using systemd (otherwise
the console logs are duplicated to the journal). This commit does the
same for the Windows service, starting Elasticsearch with the --quiet
flag to avoid standard output being written to the service stdout logs.
