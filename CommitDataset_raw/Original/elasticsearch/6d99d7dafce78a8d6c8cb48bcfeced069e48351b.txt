ListenableFuture should preserve ThreadContext (#34394)

ListenableFuture may run a listener on the same thread that called the
addListener method or it may execute on another thread after the future
has completed. Whenever the ListenableFuture stores the listener for
execution later, it should preserve the thread context which is what
this change does.
