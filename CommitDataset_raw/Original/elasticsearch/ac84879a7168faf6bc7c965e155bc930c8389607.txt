Use soft deletes to maintain doc history (#29549)

Today we can use the soft-deletes feature from Lucene to maintain a
history of a document. This change simply replaces hard-deletes by
soft-deletes in Engine.

Besides marking a document as deleted, we also index a tombstone
associated with that delete operation. Storing delete tombstones allows
us to have a history of sequence-based operations which can serve in
recovery or rollback.
