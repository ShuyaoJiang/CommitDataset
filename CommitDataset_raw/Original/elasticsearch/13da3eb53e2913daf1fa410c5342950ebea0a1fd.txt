Refactor QueryStringQuery for 6.0 (#25646)

This change refactors the query_string query to analyze the query text around logical operators of the query string the same way than a match_query/multi_match_query.
It also adds a type parameter that can be used to change the way multi fields query are built the same way than a multi_match query does.

Now that these queries share the same behavior regarding text analysis, some parameters are obsolete and have been deprecated:

split_on_whitespace: This setting is now ignored with a deprecation notice
if it is used explicitely. With this PR The query_string always splits on logical operator.
It simplifies the understanding of the other parameters that can have different meanings
depending on the value of split_on_whitespace.

auto_generate_phrase_queries: This setting is now ignored with a deprecation notice
if it is used explicitely. This setting only makes sense when the parser splits on whitespace.

use_dismax: This setting is now ignored with a deprecation notice
if it is used explicitely. The tie_breaker parameter is sufficient to handle best_fields/most_fields.

Fixes #25574
