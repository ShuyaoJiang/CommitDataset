SQL: Fix function resolution (#34137)

Remove CamelCase to CAMEL_CASE conversion when resolving
a function. Only convert user input to upper case and then
try to match with aliases or primary names.

Keep the internal conversion FunctionName to FUNCTION__NAME
which provides flexibility when registering functions by their class
name.

Fixes: #34114
