reroute API: log messages from commands (#25955)

Gives allocation commands from the cluster reroute API
the ability to provide messages to be logged once the 
cluster state change has been committed. 

The purpose of this change is to create a record in the 
logs when allocation commands which could potentially
be destructive are applied. The allocate_empty_primary
and allocate_stale_primary commands are the only ones
that currently provide log messages.

Closes #22821
