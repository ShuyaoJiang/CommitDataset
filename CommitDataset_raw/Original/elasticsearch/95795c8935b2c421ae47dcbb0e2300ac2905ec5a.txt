Pass main class by environment variable (#31149)

A previous refactoring of the CLI scripts migrated all of the CLI tools
to shell to a common script, elasticsearch-cli. This approach is fine in
Bash where it is easy to tear arguments apart but it doesn't work so
well on Windows where quoting is insane. To avoid having to tear the
arguments apart to separate the first argument to elasticsearch-cli from
the remaining arguments, we instead choose a strategy where we can avoid
tearing the arguments apart. To do this, we will instead pass the main
class by an environment variable and then we can pass the arguments
straight through. This will let us avoid awful quoting issues on
Windows. This is the non-Windows side of that effort and the Windows
side will be in a follow-up.
