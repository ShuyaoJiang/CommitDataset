Handle primary failure handling replica response

Today if the primary throws an exception while handling the replica
response (e.g., because it is already closed while updating the local
checkpoint for the replica), or because of a bug that causes an
exception to be thrown in the replica operation listener, this exception
is caught by the underlying transport handler plumbing and is translated
into a response handler failure transport exception that is passed to
the onFailure method of the replica operation listener. This causes the
primary to turn around and fail the replica which is a disastrous and
incorrect outcome as there's nothing wrong with the replica, it is the
primary that is broken and deserves a paddlin'. This commit handles this
situation by failing the primary.
