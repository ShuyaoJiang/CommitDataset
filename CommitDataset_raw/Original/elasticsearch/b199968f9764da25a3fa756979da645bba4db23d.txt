[ML] Shave off DeleteExpiredDataIT runtime (#39557)

This commit parallelizes some parts of the test
and its remove an unnecessary refresh call.
On my local machine it shaves off about 15 seconds
for a test execution time of ~64s (down from ~80s).
This test is still slow but progress over perfection.
