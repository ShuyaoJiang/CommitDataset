Close Index API should force a flush if a sync is needed (#37961)

This commit changes the TransportVerifyShardBeforeCloseAction so that it issues a 
forced flush, forcing the translog and the Lucene commit to contain the same max seq 
number and global checkpoint in the case the Translog contains operations that were 
not written in the IndexWriter (like a Delete that touches a non existing doc). This way 
the assertion added in #37426 won't trip.
