Fix created version for similarity validation. (#33890)

It mistakenly uses the Elasticsearch major version instead of the Lucene major
version. I noticed it when backporting, it is not noticeable on master because
the only two Lucene versions that are supported, 7 and 8, encode norms the same
way, unlike Lucene 6.
