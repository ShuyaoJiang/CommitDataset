Don't build bwc on assemble (#33372)

Gradle triggers the build of artifacts even if assemble is disabled.
Most users will not need bwc distributions after running `./gradlew
assemble` so instead of forcing them to add `-x buildBwcVersion`, we
detect this and skip the configuration of the artifacts.
