Use exact numDocs in synced-flush and metadata snapshot (#30228)

Since #29458, we use a searcher to calculate the number of documents for
a commit stats. Sadly, that approach is flawed. The searcher might no
longer point to the last commit if it's refreshed. As synced-flush
requires an exact numDocs to work correctly, we have to exclude all
soft-deleted docs.

This commit makes synced-flush stop using CommitStats but read an exact
numDocs directly from an index commit.
