Improve exception handling on TransportMasterNodeAction (#29314)

We have seen exceptions bubble up to the uncaught exception handler. Checking the blocks can
lead for example to IndexNotFoundException when the indices are resolved. In order to make
TransportMasterNodeAction more resilient against such expected exceptions, this code change
wraps the execution of doStart() into a try catch and informs the listener in case of failures.
