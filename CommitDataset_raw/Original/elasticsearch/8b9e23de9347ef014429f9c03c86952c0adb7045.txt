Plugins: Add versionless alias to all security policy codebase properties (#26756)

This is a followup to #26521. This commit expands the alias added for
the elasticsearch client codebase to all codebases. The original full
jar name property is left intact. This only adds an alias without the
version, which should help ease the pain in updating any versions (ES
itself or dependencies).
