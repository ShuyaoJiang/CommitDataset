Tie break on cluster alias when merging shard search failures (#38715)

A recent test failure triggered an edge case scenario where failures may be coming back with the same shard id, yet from different clusters.
This commit adapts the failures comparator to take the cluster alias into account when merging failures as part of CCS requests execution.
Also the corresponding test has been split in two: with and without
search shard target set to the failure.

Closes #38672
