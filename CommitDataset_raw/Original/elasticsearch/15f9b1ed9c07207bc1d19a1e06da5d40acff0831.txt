[ML] Impove mechanism for ignoring maintenance windows (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1914)

Currently, the autodetect process has an `ignoreDowntime`
parameter which, when set to true, results to time being
skipped over to the end of the bucket of the first data
point received. After that, skipping time requires closing
and opening the job. With regard to datafeeds, this does not
work well with real-time requests which use the advance-time
API in order to ensure results are created for data gaps.

This commit improves this functionality by making it more
flexible and less ambiguous.

- flush API now supports skip_time parameter which
sends a control message to the autodetect process
telling it to skip time to a given value
- the flush API now also returns the last_finalized_bucket_end
time which allows clients to resume data searches correctly
- the datafeed start API issues a skip_time request when the
given start time is after the resume point. It then resumes
the search from the last_finalized_bucket_end time.
