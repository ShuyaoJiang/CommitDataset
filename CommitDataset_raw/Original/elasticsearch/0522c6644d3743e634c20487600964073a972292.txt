Docs: Remove duplicate test setup

The range docs had an introductory section that described how to set up
and index *and* a test setup section in `docs/build.gradle` that
duplicated that section. This is bad because these section can (and do)
drift from one another. This change removes the setup in build.gradle
and marks the introductor snippet with `// TESTSETUP` so it is used on
all the snippets.
