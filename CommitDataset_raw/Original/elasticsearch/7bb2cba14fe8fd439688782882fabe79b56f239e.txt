[Security] Reset IndexAuditTrail to INITIALISED before start (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3807)

Calling start() when already in the STARTING state doesn't do anything, so the component
gets stuck in STARTING state forever.

Also: wait on the required index name not just the cluster.

Also: added more logging to help diagnose such issues (either in RemoteIndexAuditTrailStartingTests or production)
