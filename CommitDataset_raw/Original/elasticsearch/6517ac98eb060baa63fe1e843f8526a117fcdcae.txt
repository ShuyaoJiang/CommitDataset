Fail if reading from closed KeyStoreWrapper (#30394)

In #28255 the implementation of the elasticsearch.keystore was changed
to no longer be built on top of a PKCS#12 keystore. A side effect of
that change was that calling getString or getFile on a closed
KeyStoreWrapper ceased to throw an exception, and would instead return
a value consisting of all 0 bytes.

This change restores the previous behaviour as closely as possible.
It is possible to retrieve the _keys_ from a closed keystore, but any
attempt to get or set the entries will throw an IllegalStateException.
