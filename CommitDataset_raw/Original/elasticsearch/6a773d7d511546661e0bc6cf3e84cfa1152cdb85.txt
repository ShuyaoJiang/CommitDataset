Fix error message when package install fails due to missing Java (#36077)

Currently is `java` is not in $PATH the preinst script fails
prematurely and prevents an appropriate message from getting displayed
to the user.

Make package installation more user friendly when java is not in
$PATH and add a test for it.

Also use a she-bang in the preinst script, as, at least in Debian,
maintainer scripts must start with the #! convention [1].

Relates #31845
