fix UpdateSettingsRequestStreamableTests.mutateInstance (#39386)

Mutations of the timeout values were using string-representations.

This resulted in very rare cases where the original timeout value was
represented as something like "0ms" and the new random time-value generated
was "0s". Although their string representations differ, their underlying
TimeValue does not. This resulted in `-Dtests.seed=7F4C034C43C22B1B` to
fail.
