Move indices field from RankEvalSpec to RankEvalRequest (#28341)

Currently we store the indices specified in the request URL together with all
the other ranking evaluation specification in RankEvalSpec. This is not ideal
since e.g. the indices are not rendered to xContent and so cannot be parsed
back. Instead we should keep them in RankEvalRequest.
