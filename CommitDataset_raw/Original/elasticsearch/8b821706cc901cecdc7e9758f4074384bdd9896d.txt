Switch more tests to zen2 (#36367)

1. CCR tests work without any changes
2. `testDanglingIndices` require changes the source code (added TODO).
3. `testIndexDeletionWhenNodeRejoins` because it's using just two
nodes, adding the node to exclusions is needed on restart.
4. `testCorruptTranslogTruncationOfReplica` starts dedicated master
one, because otherwise, the cluster does not form, if nodes are stopped
and one node is started back.
5. `testResolvePath` needs TEST cluster, because all nodes are stopped
at the end of the test and it's not possible to perform checks needed
by SUITE cluster.
6. `SnapshotDisruptionIT`. Without changes, the test fails because Zen2
retries snapshot creation as soon as network partition heals. This
results into the race between creating snapshot and test cleanup logic
(deleting index). Zen1 on the
other hand, also schedules retry, but it takes some time after network
partition heals, so cleanup logic executes latter and test passes. The
check that snapshot is eventually created is added to
the end of the test.
