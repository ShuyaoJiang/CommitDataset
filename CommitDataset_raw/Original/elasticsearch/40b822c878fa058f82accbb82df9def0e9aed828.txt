Scripting: Remove support for deprecated StoredScript contexts (#31394)

Removes support for storing scripts without the usual json around the
script. So You can no longer do:
```
POST _scripts/<templatename>
{
    "query": {
        "match": {
            "title": "{{query_string}}"
        }
    }
}
```

and must instead do:
```
POST _scripts/<templatename>
{
    "script": {
        "lang": "mustache",
        "source": {
            "query": {
                "match": {
                    "title": "{{query_string}}"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This improves error reporting when you attempt to store a script but don't
quite get the syntax right. Before, there was a good chance that we'd
think of it as a "raw" template and just store it. Now we won't do that.
Nice.
