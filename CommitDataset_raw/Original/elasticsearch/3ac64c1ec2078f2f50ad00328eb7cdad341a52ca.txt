Fix total hits serialization of the search response (#36290)

This change removes the custom serialization of the total hits
and reuses the shard's serialization of Lucene#read/writeTopDocs
in the client code. This also removes the incorrect assertion that
trips randomly in bwc tests.

Closes #36284
