[Zen2] fix NodeJoinTests#testConcurrentJoining() (#36033)

Today we sometimes create a setup in which the node is a quorum on its own,
which allows it to win a pre-voting round and schedule an election essentially
at will, causing it to discard all the joins it just received and fail the
test. This change excludes this case, preventing stray elections from ruining
things.
