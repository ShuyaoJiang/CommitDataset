Reindex: Shore up rethrottle test

The rethrottle test fails from time to time because one of the child
task that want to be rethrottled hasn't properly started yet. We retry
in this case but it looks like the retry either isn't long enough or
something else strange is happening.

This change adds yet more logging so future failure of this kind will be
easier to track down and it adds an extra wait condition: this waits for
all child tasks to be running or completed before rethrottling. This
*might* avoid the failure because once a child task is properly started
it should be quite ok to rethrottle.

Relates to #26192
