Show SSL usage when security is not disabled (#40672)

It is possible to have SSL enabled but security disabled if security
was dynamically disabled by the license type (e.g. trial license).

e.g. In the following configuration:

    xpack.license.self_generated.type: trial
    # xpack.security not set, default to disabled on trial
    xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true

The security feature will be reported as

    available: true
    enabled: false

And in this case, SSL will be active even though security is not
enabled.

This commit causes the X-Pack feature usage to report the state of the
"ssl" features unless security was explicitly disabled in the
settings.
