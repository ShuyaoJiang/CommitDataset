Security: improve exact index matching performance (#36017)

This commit improves the efficiency of exact index name matching by
separating exact matches from those that include wildcards or regular
expressions. Internally, exact matching is done using a HashSet instead
of adding the exact matches to the automata. For the wildcard and
regular expression matches, the underlying implementation has not
changed.
