Fix unreachable error condition in AmazonS3Fixture (#32005)

The `else` branch where currently the error response should be thrown is not
reachable because `handler` is always non-null inside the previous outer check.
Moving error creation into an else branch on the other condition check, removing
the other superflous check for non-null handler inside the first branch.
