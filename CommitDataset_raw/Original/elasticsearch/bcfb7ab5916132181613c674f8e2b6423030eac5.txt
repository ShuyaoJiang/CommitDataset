Improved percolator's random candidate query duel test and
fixed bugs that were exposed by this:

* Duplicates query leafs were not detected in a multi level boolean query
* Tracking fields for numeric range queries did not work properly.
* The sorting that was used to find the less restrictive clauses in
  disjunction query did not work too.
