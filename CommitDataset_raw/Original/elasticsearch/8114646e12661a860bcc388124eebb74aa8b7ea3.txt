[Kerberos] Add debug log statement for exceptions (#32663)

This commit adds missing debug log statements for exceptions
that occur during ticket validation. I thought these
get logged somewhere else in authentication chain
but even after enabling trace logs I could not see them
logged. As the Kerberos exception messages are cryptic
adding full stack trace would help debugging faster.
