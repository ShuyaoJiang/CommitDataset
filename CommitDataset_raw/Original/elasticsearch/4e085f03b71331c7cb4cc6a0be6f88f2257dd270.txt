Tests: Disable watcher in ServerTransportFilterIntegrationTests

These tests are starting their own nodes and do not use the testing
trigger schedule class.

There are occasional test failure due to a race condition where watcher
is in the process of being started, but cannot be shut down properly,
because starting up was not finished when the shut down was called for.

These filter tests do not rely on watcher, so we can disable them for
now, but we still need to fix a race condition in starting/stopping
watcher.
