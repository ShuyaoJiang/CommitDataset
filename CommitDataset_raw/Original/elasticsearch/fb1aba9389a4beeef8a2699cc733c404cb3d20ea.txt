Improve NodeVersionAllocationDecider messages (#29356)

Since #26542 the NodeVersionAllocationDecider tries to explain its NO decisions
as follows:

    ... may not support codecs or postings formats for a newer Lucene version

However, this message often appears during a rolling upgrade, and experience
has shown that it seems to cause more confusion and worry than it needs to.
This change fixes that by removing the explanation again, reducing the message
to a statement of fact about the respective nodes' versions.

Additionally, the same wording was used for version incompatibilities when
allocating a primary (vs its previous location) and a replica (vs its primary).
This change separates these two cases so they can have separate, clearer
wording.

Fixes #29228
