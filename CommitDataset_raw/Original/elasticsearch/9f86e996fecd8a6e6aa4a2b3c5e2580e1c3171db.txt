[Zen2] Support rolling upgrades from Zen1 (#35737)

We support rolling upgrades from Zen1 by keeping the master as a Zen1 node
until there are no more Zen1 nodes in the cluster, using the following
principles:

- Zen1 nodes will never vote for Zen2 nodes
- Zen2 nodes will, while not bootstrapped, vote for Zen1 nodes
- Zen2 nodes that were previously part of a mixed cluster will automatically
  (and unsafely) bootstrap themselves when the last Zen1 node leaves.
