Make RestHighLevelClient's Request class public (#26627)

Request class is currently package protected, making it difficult for
the users to extend the RestHighLevelClient and to use its protected
methods to execute requests. This commit makes the Request class public
and changes few methods of RestHighLevelClient to be protected.
