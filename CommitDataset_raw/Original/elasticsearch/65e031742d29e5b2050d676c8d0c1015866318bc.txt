Test fixtures krb5 (#40297)

Replaces the vagrant based kerberos fixtures with docker based test fixtures plugin.
The configuration is now entirely static on the docker side and no longer driven by Gradle,
also two different services are being configured since there are two different consumers of the fixture that can run in parallel and require different configurations.
