* SQL: update support for nested docs

Expand sample data with nested docs
Optimize source generation for nested parents
Nested objects fields are specified in inner-hits and don't need to be
specified at the top-level query. Further more disable parent source if
not needed.
ComputingFieldRef needs to return the hitName of its wrapped children
otherwise nested values cannot be extracted
Disable GROUP BY/HAVING on nested fields
Update FieldAttribute requirements in the random tests
