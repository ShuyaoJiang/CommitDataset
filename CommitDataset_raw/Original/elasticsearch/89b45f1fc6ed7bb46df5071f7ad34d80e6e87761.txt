Remove deprecated pipeline request contructors (#37366)

The constructors in PutPipelineRequest and SimulatePipelineRequest that guess
the xContent type from the provided source are deprecated since 6.0 and each
have a counterpart that takes the xContent type as an explicit argument.
Removing these ctors together with the builders and methods in
ClusterAdminClient that don't have the xContent type as argument.
