SQL: Fix grammar for `*` in arithm expressions (#34176)

Previously, parsing an arithmetic expression with `*` and no spaces,
e.g.: `2*i` threw a parsing exception as the grammar rule for
tableIdentifier was clashing with the rule for arithmetic operator `*`.

This issue comes already in the lexer and the left part of the
expression (in our example `2*`) was recognised as a
TABLE_IDENTIFIER token.

The solution adopted is to allow the `*` wildcard in the table name
only if it's surrounded with double quotes, e.g.: `"my*index"`

Closes: #33957
