Update BucketUtils#suggestShardSideQueueSize signature (#33210)

`BucketUtils#suggestShardSideQueueSize` used to calculate the shard_size based on the number of shards. It returns now a different value only based on whether we are querying a single shard or multiple shards. This commit replaces the numberOfShards argument with a boolean that tells whether we are querying a single shard or not.
