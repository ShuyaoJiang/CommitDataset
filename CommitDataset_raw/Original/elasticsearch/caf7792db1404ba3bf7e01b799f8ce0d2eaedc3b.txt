Scripting: Rename SearchScript.needsScores to needs_score (#25235)

This commit renames the needsScores method so as to make it
automatically generatable, based on the name of the `_score` variable
which is available in search scripts. It also adds documentation to
ScriptContext to explain the naming and signature of such methods.
