Speed up converting of temporal accessor to zoned date time (#37915)

The existing implementation was slow due to exceptions being thrown if
an accessor did not have a time zone. This implementation queries for
having a timezone, local time and local date and also checks for an
instant preventing to throw an exception and thus speeding up the conversion.

This removes the existing method and create a new one named
DateFormatters.from(TemporalAccessor accessor) to resemble the naming of
the java time ones.

Before this change an epoch millis parser using the toZonedDateTime
method took approximately 50x longer.
