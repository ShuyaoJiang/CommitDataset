ccr: use indices stats api to fetch global checkpoint of the follower shards and
keep track of shard follow stats inside shard follow stats' node task instead of persistent task status.

By maintaining the shard follow stats inside its node task the stats update is quicker as
no cluster state update is required. The stats are now transient; meaning if the task
is going to run a different node then the stats are gone too. Currently only the processed
global checkpoint is being tracked and this is being restored when a shard follow node task
starts via the indices stats api (the reason of the first change of this change). Other stats
that we may add in the future (like fetch_time, see: https://gist.github.com/s1monw/dba13daf8493bf48431b72365e110717)
it is ok if we start from zero in case a shard follow task moves to another node.
