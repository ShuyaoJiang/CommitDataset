[Tests] Change cluster scope in CorruptedFileIT and FlushIT (#37229)

These tests failed on CI multiple times in the past weeks because they use a 
test cluster with a SUITE scope that recreates nodes between tests. With such 
a scope, nodes can be recreated in between test executions and can inherit a 
node id from a previous test execution, while they are assigned a random data 
path. With the successive node recreations it is possible that a newly recreated 
node shares the same node id (but different data path) as a non recreated node.

This commit changes the cluster scope of the CorruptedFileIT and FlushIT 
tests which often fail.

The failure is reproducable with :

./gradlew :server:integTest -Dtests.seed=EF3A50C225CF377 
-Dtests.class=org.elasticsearch.index.store.CorruptedFileIT 
-Dtests.security.manager=true -Dtests.locale=th-TH-u-nu-thai-x-lvariant-TH -Dtests.timezone=America/Rio_Branco 
-Dcompiler.java=11 -Druntime.java=8
