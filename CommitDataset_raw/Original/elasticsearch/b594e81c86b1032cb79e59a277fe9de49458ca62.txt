SQL: Fix issue with field names containing "." (#37364)

Adjust FieldExtractor to handle fields which contain `.` in their
name, regardless where they fall in, in the document hierarchy. E.g.:

```
{
  "a.b": "Elastic Search"
}

{
  "a": {
    "b.c": "Elastic Search"
  }
}

{
  "a.b": {
    "c": {
      "d.e" : "Elastic Search"
    }
  }
}
```

Fixes: #37128
