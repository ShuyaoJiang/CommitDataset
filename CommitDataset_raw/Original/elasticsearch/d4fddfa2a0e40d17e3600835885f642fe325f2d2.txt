Remove log4j dependency from elasticsearch-core (#28705)

* Remove log4j dependency from elasticsearch-core

This removes the log4j dependency from our elasticsearch-core project. It was
originally necessary only for our jar classpath checking. It is now replaced by
a `Consumer<String>` so that the es-core dependency doesn't have external
dependencies.

The parts of #28191 which were moved in conjunction (like `ESLoggerFactory` and
`Loggers`) have been moved back where appropriate, since they are not required
in the core jar.

This is tangentially related to #28504

* Add javadocs for `output` parameter

* Change @code to @link
