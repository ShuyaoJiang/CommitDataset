Remove throws IOException from PipelineAggregationBuilder#create (#40222)

IOException are never thrown in any of the existing pipeline aggregation
builders. Removing the throws IOException from the create method allows
to remove it also from a couple of other methods which ends up simplifying
 AggregationPhase (one less catch).
