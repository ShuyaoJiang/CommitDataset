FastVectorHighlighter should not cache the field query globally (#25197)

This commit removes the global caching of the field query and replaces it with
a caching per field. Each field can use a different `highlight_query` and the rewriting of
some queries (prefix, automaton, ...) depends on the targeted field so the query used for highlighting
must be unique per field.
There might be a small performance penalty when highlighting multiple fields since the query needs to be rewritten
once per highlighted field with this change.

Fixes #25171
