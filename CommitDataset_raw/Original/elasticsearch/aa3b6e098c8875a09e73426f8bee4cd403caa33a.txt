Reject follow request if following setting not enabled on follower (#32448)

Today we do not check if the `following_index` setting of the follower
is enabled or not when processing a follow-request. If that setting is
disabled, the follower will use the default engine, not the following
engine. This change checks and rejects such invalid follow requests.
