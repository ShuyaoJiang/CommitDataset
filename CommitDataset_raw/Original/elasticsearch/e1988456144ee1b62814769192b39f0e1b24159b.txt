[ML] Avoid masses of log spam/stack traces on shutdown (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1495)

Suppress many job/datafeed errors if a node is known to be shutting down. Also, ensure started datafeeds and open jobs don't end up stopped/failed due to errors as the shutdown progresses, as this would prevent them automatically relocating to a different node.
