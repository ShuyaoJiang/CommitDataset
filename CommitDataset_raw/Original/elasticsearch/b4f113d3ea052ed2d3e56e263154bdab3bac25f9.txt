Don't block on peer recovery on the target side (#37076)

Today we block using the generic thread-pool on the target side
until the source side has fully executed the recovery. We still
block on the source side executing the recovery in a blocking fashion
but there is no reason to block on the target side. This will
release generic threads early if there are many concurrent recoveries
happen.
