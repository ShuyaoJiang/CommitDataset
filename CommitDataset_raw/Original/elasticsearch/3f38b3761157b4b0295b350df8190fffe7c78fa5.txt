Handle failure to release retention leases in ILM (#39281)

It is possible that the Unfollow API may fail to release shard history
retention leases when unfollowing, so this needs to be handled by the
ILM Unfollow action. There's nothing much that can be done automatically
about it from the follower side, so this change makes the ILM unfollow
action simply ignore those failures.
