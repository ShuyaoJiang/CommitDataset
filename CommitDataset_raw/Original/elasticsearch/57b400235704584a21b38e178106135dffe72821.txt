Include duplicate jar when jarhell check fails

When the jarhell check fails due to a duplicate jar on the classpath,
the exception message includes the full classpath but not the duplicated
jar. For a long classpath, this can make it difficult to find the jar
that is duplicated. This commit changes the exception message to include
the duplicated jar.
