SQL: Fix queries with filter resulting in NO_MATCH (#34812)

Previously, `Mapper` was returning an incorrect plan which resulted in an
```
SQLFeatureNotSupportedException: Found 1 problem(s)
line 1:8: Unexecutable item
```

Queries with a `WHERE` and/or `HAVING` clause which results in NO_MATCH
are now handled correctly and return 0 rows.

Fixes: #34613
