Make _id terms optional in segment containing only noop (#30409)

Previously only index and delete operations are indexed into Lucene,
therefore every segment should have both _id and _version terms as these
operations contain both terms. However, this is no longer guaranteed
after noop is also indexed into Lucene. A segment which contains only
no-ops does not have neither _id or _version because a no-op does not
contain these terms.

This change adds a dummy version to no-ops and makes _id terms optional
in PerThreadIDVersionAndSeqNoLookup.
