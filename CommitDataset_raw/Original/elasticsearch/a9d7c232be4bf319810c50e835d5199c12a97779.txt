Fix packaging tests

Since elastic/elasticsearch#26878, array and list of settings are
internally represented as actual lists. This makes filtering works
as expected when it comes to filter out arrays/lists.

The packaging tests used to check the presence of the XPack SSL
certificated_authorities setting which should have always been filtered.

By fixing the filtering of settings, elastic/elasticsearch#26878 broke
this packaging test.

This commit changes this test so that it does not expect certificated_authorities
setting to exist in the Nodes Info response.
