Uses TransportMasterNodeAction to update shard snapshot status (#27165)

Currently, we are using a plain TransportRequestHandler to post snapshot
status messages to the master. However, it doesn't have a robust retry
mechanism as TransportMasterNodeAction. This change migrates from
TransportRequestHandler to TransportMasterNodeAction for the new
versions and keeps the current implementation for the old versions.

Closes #27151
