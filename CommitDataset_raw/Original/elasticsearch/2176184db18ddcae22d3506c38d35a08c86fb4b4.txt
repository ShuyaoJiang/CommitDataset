[Zen2] Introduce gossip-like discovery of master nodes (#32246)

This commit introduces the `PeerFinder` which can be used to collect the
identities of the master-eligible nodes in a masterless cluster, based on the
`UnicastHostsProvider`, the nodes in the `ClusterState`, and nodes that other
nodes have discovered.
