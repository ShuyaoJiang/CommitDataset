Minor DocWriteResponse changes (#29675)

Remove double if depending on the Result value. It makes little sense to
pass in a boolean flag based on a Result value that we already have,
if that internally is represented again as a `Result` value.

Also changed the `Result` `lowercase` instance member to be computed
based on `name()` instead of `toString()` which is safer and to use
`Locale.ROOT` instead of `Locale.ENGLISH`
