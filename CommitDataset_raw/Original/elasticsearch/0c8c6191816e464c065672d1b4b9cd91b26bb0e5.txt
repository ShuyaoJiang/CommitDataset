Fix audit index template upgrade loop (#30779)

The Index Audit trail allows the override of the template index
settings with settings specified on the conf file.
A bug will manifest when such conf file settings are specified
for templates that need to be upgraded. The bug is an endless
upgrade loop because the upgrade, although successful, is
not reckoned as such by the upgrade service.
