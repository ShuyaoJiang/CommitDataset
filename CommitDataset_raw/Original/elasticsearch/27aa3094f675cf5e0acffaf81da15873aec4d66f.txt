Adds GraphExploreRequest as a remote index request (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1836)

The graph API needs to be able to search in remote indices. Although it uses the Search API to perform the search and so doesnâ€™t need to deal with remote indexes directly, the security feature needs to know it can be used with remote indexes so it knows to include remote indices in the list of indices accessible from the API for index level security
