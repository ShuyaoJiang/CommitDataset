Make SignificantTerms.Bucket an interface rather than an abstract class (#24670)

This commit changes SignificantTerms.Bucket so that it is not an
abstract class anymore but an interface. It will be easier for the Java
High Level Rest Client to provide its own implementation of
SignificantTerms and SignificantTerms.Bucket. Also, it is now more
coherent with the others aggregations.
