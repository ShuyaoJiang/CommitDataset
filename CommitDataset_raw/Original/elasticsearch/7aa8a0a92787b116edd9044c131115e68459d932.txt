INGEST: Extend KV Processor (#31789) (#32232)

* INGEST: Extend KV Processor (#31789)

Added more capabilities supported by LS to the KV processor:
* Stripping of brackets and quotes from values (`include_brackets` in corresponding LS filter)
* Adding key prefixes
* Trimming specified chars from keys and values

Refactored the way the filter is configured to avoid conditionals during execution.
Refactored Tests a little to not have to add more redundant getters for new parameters.

Relates #31786
* Add documentation
