Simplify Translog#closeOnTragicEvent (#29413)

This commit simplifies the invocations to
Translog#closeOnTragicEvent. This method already catches all possible
exceptions and suppresses the non-AlreadyClosedExceptions into the
exception that triggered the invocation. Therefore, there is no need for
callers to do this same logic (which would never execute).
