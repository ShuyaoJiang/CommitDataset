Add early termination support for min/max aggregations (#33375)

This commit adds the support to early terminate the collection of a leaf
in the min/max aggregator. If the query matches all documents the min and max value
for a numeric field can be retrieved efficiently in the points reader.
This change applies this optimization when possible.
