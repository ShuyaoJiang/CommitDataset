Remove canSetPolicy, canUpdatePolicy, and canRemovePolicy (#33037)

* Remove canSetPolicy, canUpdatePolicy and canRemovePolicy

Since we now store a pre-compiled list of steps for an index's phase in the
`PolicyStepsRegistry`, we no longer need to worry about updating policies as any
updates won't affect the current phase, and will only be picked up on phase
transitions.

This also removes the tests that test these methods

Relates to #29823
