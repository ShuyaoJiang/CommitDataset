Implement basic `CcrRepository` restore (#36287)

This is related to #35975. It implements a basic restore functionality
for the CcrRepository. When the restore process is kicked off, it
configures the new index as expected for a follower index. This means
that the index has a different uuid, the version is not incremented, and
the Ccr metadata is installed.

When the restore shard method is called, an empty shard is initialized.
