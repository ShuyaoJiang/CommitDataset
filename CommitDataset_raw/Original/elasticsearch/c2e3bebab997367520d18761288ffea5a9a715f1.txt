Ensure KeyStoreWrapper decryption exceptions are handled (#32464)

* Ensure decryption related exceptions are handled

This commit ensures that all possible Exceptions in
KeyStoreWrapper#decrypt() are handled. More specifically, in the
case that a wrong password is used for secure settings, calling readX
on the DataInputStream that wraps the CipherInputStream can throw an
IOException. It also adds a test for loading a KeyStoreWrapper with
a wrong password.

Resolves #32411
