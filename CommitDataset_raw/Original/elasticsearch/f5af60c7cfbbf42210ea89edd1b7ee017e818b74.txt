SQL: Fix error message on bad index (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3312)

Fixes the error message that SQL produces when it sees unsupported
indexes. It was always returning all broken indexes as "unknown" even
though we have much better error messages. It was just throwing them
away.

I caught this originally when backporting to 6.x where we had a test
that we produced a useful error message when the user attempted to run
SQL on an index with more than one type. We couldn't run that in the
feature/sql branch because it is inside the full cluster restart tests
and the "old" version of Elasticsearch used in those tests in
feature/sql is 6.x which doesn't allow indexes with multiple types. When
I backported to 6.x the test failed because it hadn't been run before.

In addition to fixing that test and the problem, this adds another test
that will reveal the problem when run in the feature/sql and master
branch.
