Handle min_doc_freq in phrase suggester (#40840)

The phrase suggesters have an option to remove terms that have
a frequency lower than a provided min_doc_freq. However this value is
overwritten by the frequency of the original term in the popular mode.
This change ensures that we keep the maximum value between the provided
min_doc_value and the original term frequency as a threshold to select
candidates.
