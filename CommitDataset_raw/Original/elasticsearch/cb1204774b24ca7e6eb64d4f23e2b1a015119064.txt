Include the _index, _type and _id to nested search hits in the top_hits and inner_hits response.
Also include _type and _id for parent/child hits inside inner hits.

In the case of top_hits aggregation the nested search hits are
directly returned and are not grouped by a root or parent document, so
it is important to include the _id and _index attributes in order to know
to what documents these nested search hits belong to.

Closes #27053
