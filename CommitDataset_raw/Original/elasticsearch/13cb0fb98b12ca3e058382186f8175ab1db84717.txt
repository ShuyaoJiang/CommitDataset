Periodically try to reassign unassigned persistent tasks (#36069)

Previously persistent task assignment was checked in the
following situations:

- Persistent tasks are changed
- A node joins or leaves the cluster
- The routing table is changed
- Custom metadata in the cluster state is changed
- A new master node is elected

However, there could be situations when a persistent
task that could not be assigned to a node could become
assignable due to some other change, such as memory
usage on the nodes.

This change adds a timed recheck of persistent task
assignment to account for such situations.  The timer
is suspended while checks triggered by cluster state
changes are in-flight to avoid adding burden to an
already busy cluster.

Closes #35792
