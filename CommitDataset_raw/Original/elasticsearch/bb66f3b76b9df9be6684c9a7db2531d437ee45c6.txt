Explicitly reject duplicate data paths

Duplicate data paths already fail to work because we would attempt to
take out a node lock on the directory a second time which will fail
after the first lock attempt succeeds. However, how this failure
manifests is not apparent at all and is quite difficult to
debug. Instead, we should explicitly reject duplicate data paths to make
the failure cause more obvious.
