Test: do not copy secure settings when creating random directory service (#25297)

In tests, we sometimes create a random directory service and as part of that the IndexSettings get
built again. When we build them again, we need to make sure we do not set the secure settings on
the new IndexMetaData object that gets created as the node settings already have the secure
settings and the index settings and node settings will be combined. If both have secure settings,
the settings builder will throw an AlreadySetException.
