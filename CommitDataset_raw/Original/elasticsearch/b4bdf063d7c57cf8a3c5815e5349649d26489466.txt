Tie-break completion suggestions with same score and surface form (#39564)

In case multiple completion suggestion entries have the same score and
surface form, the order in which such options will be returned is
currently not deterministic.

With this commmit we introduce tie-breaking for such situations, based
on shard id, index name, index uuid and doc id like we already do for
 ordinary search hits. With this change we also make shardIndex
mandatory when sorting and comparing completion suggestion options,
which was previously only needed later when fetching hits).

Also, we need to make sure shardIndex is properly set when merging
completion suggestions coming from multiple clusters in
`SearchResponseMerger`
