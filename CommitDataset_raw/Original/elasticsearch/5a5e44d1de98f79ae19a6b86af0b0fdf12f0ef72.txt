Simplify Snapshot Create Request Handling (#37464)

* The internal create request is absolutely redundant, the only difference to the transport request is that we resolved the snapshot
name when moving from the transport to the internal version
  * Removed it and passed the transport request into the snapshot service instead
* nicer way of resolve snapshot name in callback
