Remove two NOCOMMITs

* TimeoutInfo - This is now tracked in the SQL tracker github issue
* AbstractProto - Convert to a TODO as we *can* handle it after
release. I've added it to the SQL tracker github issue in a special
section for low priority protocol stuff. Protocol stuff is special
because if we can make the change before release we don't have to
worry about backwards compatibility.
