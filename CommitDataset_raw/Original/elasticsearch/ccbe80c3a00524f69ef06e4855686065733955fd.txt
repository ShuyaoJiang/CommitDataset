Introduce durability of circuit breaking exception

With this commit we differentiate between permanent circuit breaking
exceptions (which require intervention from an operator and should not
be automatically retried) and transient ones (which may heal themselves
eventually and should be retried). Furthermore, the parent circuit
breaker will categorize a circuit breaking exception as either transient
or permanent based on the categorization of memory usage of its child
circuit breakers.
