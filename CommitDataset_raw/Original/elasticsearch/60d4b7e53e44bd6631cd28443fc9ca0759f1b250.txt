Add the ability to refresh tokens obtained via the API (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3468)

This commit adds the ability to refresh tokens that have been obtained by the API using a refresh
token. Refresh tokens are one time use tokens that are valid for 24 hours. The tokens may be used
to get a new access and refresh token if the refresh token has not been invalidated or
already refreshed.
