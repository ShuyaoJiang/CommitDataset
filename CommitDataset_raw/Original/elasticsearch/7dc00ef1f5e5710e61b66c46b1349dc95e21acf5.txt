Search option terminate_after does not handle post_filters and aggregations correctly (#28459)

* Search option terminate_after does not handle post_filters and aggregations correctly

This change fixes the handling of the `terminate_after` option when post_filters (or min_score) are used.
`post_filter` should be applied before `terminate_after` in order to terminate the query when enough document are accepted
by the post_filters.
This commit also changes the type of exception thrown by `terminate_after` in order to ensure that multi collectors (aggregations)
do not try to continue the collection when enough documents have been collected.

Closes #28411
