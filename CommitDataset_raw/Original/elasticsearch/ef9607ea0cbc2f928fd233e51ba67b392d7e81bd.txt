Track fetch exceptions for shard follow tasks (#33047)

This commit adds tracking and reporting for fetch exceptions. We track
fetch exceptions per fetch, keeping track of up to the maximum number of
concurrent fetches. With each failing fetch, we associate the from
sequence number with the exception that caused the fetch. We report
these in the CCR stats endpoint, and add some testing for this tracking.
