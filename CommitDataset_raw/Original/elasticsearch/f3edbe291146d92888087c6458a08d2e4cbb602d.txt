Security: remove SSL settings fallback (#36846)

This commit removes the fallback for SSL settings. While this may be
seen as a non user friendly change, the intention behind this change
is to simplify the reasoning needed to understand what is actually
being used for a given SSL configuration. Each configuration now needs
to be explicitly specified as there is no global configuration or
fallback to some other configuration.

Closes #29797
