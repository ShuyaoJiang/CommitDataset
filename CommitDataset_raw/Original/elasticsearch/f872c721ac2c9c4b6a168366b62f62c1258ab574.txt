Run Node deprecation checks locally (#38065) (#38250)

At times, we need to check for usage of deprecated settings in settings
which should not be returned by the NodeInfo API.  This commit changes
the deprecation info API to run all node checks locally so that these
settings can be checked without exposing them via any externally
accessible API.
