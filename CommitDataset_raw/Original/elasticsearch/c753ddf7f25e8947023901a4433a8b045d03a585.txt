Enable TLS trust restrictions by subject alternative name  (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1919)

Optional restrictions can be applied on top of an existing certificate trust scheme (PEM CAs, JKS TrustStore etc).
The restrictions reduce the set of certificate that would be otherwise trusted.

In this commit, the only supported restrictions are to filter by the certificate's SubjectAlternativeNames that are tagged as "other name" with an object-identifier of "cn"
