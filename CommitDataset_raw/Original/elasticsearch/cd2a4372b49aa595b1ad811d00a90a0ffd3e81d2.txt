RecoveryIT should wait for green when in mixed cluster to avoid unassigned shards

The test starts with two old nodes and creates indices (without waiting for green, which is fixed here too). Then it restarts one of the nodes and waits for it to join the cluster. This wait condition only uses wait for yellow as our generic infra doesn't how many nodes are there in total. Once the restarted node is part of the cluster (mixed mode) the second old node is restarted. If indices are not fully allocated when that happens, the shards will go into delayed unassigned mode. If the recovery of the replica never completed we may end up with corrupted / no secondary copy on the node. This will cause the shards to be delayed for 1m before being reassigned and the test will time out.
