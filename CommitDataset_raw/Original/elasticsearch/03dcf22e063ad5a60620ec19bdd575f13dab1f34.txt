Move caching of the size of a directory to `StoreDirectory`. (#30581)

In spite of the existing caching, I have seen a number of nodes hot threads
where one thread had been spending all its cpu on computing the size of a
directory. I am proposing to move the computation of the size of the directory
to `StoreDirectory` in order to skip recomputing the size of the directory if
no changes have been made. This should help with users that have read-only
indices, which is very common for time-based indices.
