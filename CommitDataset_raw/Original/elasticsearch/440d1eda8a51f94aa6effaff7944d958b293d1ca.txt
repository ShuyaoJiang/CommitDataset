Fix failures in BulkProcessorIT#testGlobalParametersAndBulkProcessor. (#38129)

This PR fixes a couple test issues:
* It narrows an assertWarnings call that was too broad, and wasn't always
  applicable with certain random sequences.
* Previously, we could send a typeless bulk request containing '_type: 'null'.
  Now we omit the _type key altogether for typeless requests.
