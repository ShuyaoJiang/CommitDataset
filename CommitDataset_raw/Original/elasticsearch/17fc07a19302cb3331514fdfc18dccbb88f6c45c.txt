Switch XContentBuilder from BytesStreamOutput to ByteArrayOutputStream (#28945)

This switches the underlying byte output representation used by default in
`XContentBuilder` from `BytesStreamOutput` to a `ByteArrayOutputStream` (an
`OutputStream` can still be specified manually)

This is groundwork to allow us to decouple `XContent*` from the rest of the ES
core code so that it may be factored into a separate jar.

Since `BytesStreamOutput` was not using the recycling instance of `BigArrays`,
this should not affect the circuit breaking capabilities elsewhere in the
system.
