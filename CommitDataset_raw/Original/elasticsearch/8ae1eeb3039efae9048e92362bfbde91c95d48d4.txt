[TESTS] Disable specific locales for RestrictedTrustManagerTest (#33299)

Disable specific Thai and Japanese locales as Certificate expiration
validation fails due to the date parsing of BouncyCastle (that manifests
in a FIPS 140 JVM as this is the only place we use BouncyCastle).
Added the locale switching logic here instead of subclassing
ESTestCase as these are the only tests that fail for these locales and
JVM combination.

Resolves #33081
