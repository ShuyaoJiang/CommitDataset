Adjust CombinedDeletionPolicy for multiple commits (#27456)

Today, we keep only the last index commit and use only it to calculate
the minimum required translog generation. This may no longer be correct
as we introduced a new deletion policy which keeps multiple index
commits. This change adjusts the CombinedDeletionPolicy so that it can
work correctly with a new index deletion policy.
