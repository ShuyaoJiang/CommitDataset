Check for closed connection while opening

While opening a connection to a node, a channel can subsequently
close. If this happens, a future callback whose purpose is to close all
other channels and disconnect from the node will fire. However, this
future will not be ready to close all the channels because the
connection will not be exposed to the future callback yet. Since this
callback is run once, we will never try to disconnect from this node
again and we will be left with a closed channel. This commit adds a
check that all channels are open before exposing the channel and throws
a general connection exception. In this case, the usual connection retry
logic will take over.
