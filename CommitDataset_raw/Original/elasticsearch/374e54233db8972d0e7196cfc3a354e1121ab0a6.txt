[TEST] Ensure a well-defined cleanup order for YAML tests (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1585)

Previously there were two @After methods in the XPackRestIT class, and
there is no guarantee about the order in which these run.  This commit
replaces these with a single @After method that calls the cleanup methods
in a well-defined order.
