Fix off-by-one error in shard changes action test

This commit fixes an off-by-one error in the shard changes action test
for getting operations between two sequence numbers. The off-by-one
error arises because sequence numbers are indexed from zero, so if N
documents are indexed then the maximum sequence number starting from
zero would be N - 1.
