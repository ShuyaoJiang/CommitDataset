Check cluster heath before setup-passwords (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4104)

Trying to setup passwords on a red cluster (or a cluster that cannot
reach a quorum) is generally not a good idea.

This commit:
- Adds a check for RED cluster status
- Prompts to confirm execution if the cluster is red
- Prints out the reason/type is an error response is received
- Increases the HTTP read timeout so that master election failures are
  reported correctly.
