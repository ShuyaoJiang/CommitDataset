Add api to upgrade from basic to trial license (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2419)

This is related to elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1941.

Currently we support self-generating either a basic or trial license at
cluster startup. With the addition of the basic option, it is possible
that a user would choose to self-generate and eventually register a
basic license.

This commit allows a user to upgrade to a 30-day trial license if they
have not already utilized this 30-day trial license before. Additionally
it adds a get route to check if the user is eligible to upgrade. This
route will allow kibana to implement a cleaner UI.
