[CCR] Add an internal api to read translog operations between a sequence number range (#2563)

* xdcr: Add an internal api to read translog operations between a sequence number range.

This api will be used later by the persistent task for the following index to pull data from the leader index.

The persistent task can fetch the global checkpoint from the shard stats for each primary shard of the leader index.
Based on the global checkpoint of the primary shards of the following index, the persistent task can send several
calls to the internal api added in this commit to replicate changes from follow index to leader index in a batched manner.
