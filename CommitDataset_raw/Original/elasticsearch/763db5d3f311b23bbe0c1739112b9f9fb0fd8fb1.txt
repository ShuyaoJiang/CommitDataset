Fix testCannotShrinkLeaderIndex (#38529)

This test should no longer pass when the functionality it is intended to
test is broken, as it now indexes a number of documents and verifies
that the index is staying on the same step until after indexing and
replication of those documents is finished. This prevents the test from
passing if the leader index progresses in its lifecycle during that time.
