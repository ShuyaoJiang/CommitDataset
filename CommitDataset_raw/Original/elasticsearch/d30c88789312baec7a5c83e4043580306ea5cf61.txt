Use private directory for temporary files

This change ensures that the temporary directory used for java.io.tmpdir
is a private temporary directory. To achieve this we use mktemp on macOS
and Linux to give us a private temporary directory and the value of the
environment variable TMP on Windows. For this to work with our
packaging, we add java.io.tmpdir=${ES_TMPDIR} to our packaged
jvm.options, we set ES_TMPDIR respectively in our startup scripts, and
resolve the value of the template ${ES_TMPDIR} at startup.
