Zen2: Move disruption tests to Zen2 (#35724)

- Moves disruption tests to Zen2
- Registers a few missing settings
- Removes .put(TestZenDiscovery.USE_ZEN2.getKey(), true) from tests where Zen2 is now enabled
by default through the parent test class
- Moves QuorumGatewayIT back to Zen1, as it is not stable with Zen2 as it currently relies on
dangling indices due to the lack of proper CS persistence, which triggers secondary failures
