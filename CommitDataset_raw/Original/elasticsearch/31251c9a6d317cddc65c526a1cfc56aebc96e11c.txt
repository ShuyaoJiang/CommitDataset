Make http pipelining support mandatory (#30695)

This is related to #29500 and #28898. This commit removes the abilitiy
to disable http pipelining. After this commit, any elasticsearch node
will support pipelined requests from a client. Additionally, it extracts
some of the http pipelining work to the server module. This extracted
work is used to implement pipelining for the nio plugin.
