Remove wrong assert in LocalCheckpointTrackerTests

It's possible for the set "seqNos" to contain only the "unFinishedSeq"
in the testConcurrentReplica test. If this is the case, the call
`randomValueOtherThan` won't make any progress because the predicate
will never be false.

This commit removes this expectation because it's incorrect and it's no
longer needed as we have a dedicated test to verify the contains method.
