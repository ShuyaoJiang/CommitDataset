Docs: Advice for reindexing many indices (#31279)

Folks tend to want to be able to make a single `_reindex` call to
migrate many indices. You *can* do that and we even have an example of
how to do that in the docs but it isn't always a good idea. This change
adds some advice to the docs: generally you want to make one reindex
call per index.

Closes #22920
