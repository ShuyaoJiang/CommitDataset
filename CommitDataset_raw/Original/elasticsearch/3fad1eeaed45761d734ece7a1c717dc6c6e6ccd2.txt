Un-assign persistent tasks as nodes exit the cluster (#37656)

PersistentTasksClusterService decides if a task should be reassigned by 
checking there is a node in the cluster with the same Id. If a node is 
restarted PersistentTasksClusterService may not observe the change and 
decide the task still has a valid assignment because the node's 
ephemeral Id is not used in that decision. This change un-assigns tasks
as the nodes in the cluster change.
