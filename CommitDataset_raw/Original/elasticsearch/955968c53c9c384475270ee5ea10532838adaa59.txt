[ML] Delete one type at a time when deleting model snapshots (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1637)

This avoids log spam about being unable to create new mappings in indices
that are set to only allow one type.  (It doesn't actually have any effect
on the deletion, which was working before despite the failure to create new
mappings for the legacy types referenced by the delete request.)
