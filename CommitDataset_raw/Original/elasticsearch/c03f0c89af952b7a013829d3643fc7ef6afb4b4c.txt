Fix handling of paths containing parentheses

This commit fixes an issue with the handling of paths containing
parentheses on Windows. When such a path is used as a component of
Elasticsearch home, then a later echo statement that is guarded by an if
will fail because the parentheses in the path will be confused with the
parentheses defining the if block. This commit fixes the issue by
protecting this echo statement by wrapping the possibly offending path
in quotes.
