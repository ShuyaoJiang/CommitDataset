Remove internal channel tracking in transports (#27711)

This commit attempts to continue unifying the logic between different
transport implementations. As transports call a `TcpTransport` callback
when a new channel is accepted, there is no need to internally track
channels accepted. Instead there is a set of accepted channels in
`TcpTransport`. This set is used for metrics and shutting down channels.
