TransportVerifyShardBeforeCloseAction should force a flush (#38401)

This commit changes the `TransportVerifyShardBeforeCloseAction` so that it 
always forces the flush of the shard. It seems that #37961 is not sufficient to 
ensure that the translog and the Lucene commit share the exact same max 
seq no and global checkpoint information in case of one or more noop 
operations have been made.

The `BulkWithUpdatesIT.testThatMissingIndexDoesNotAbortFullBulkRequest` 
and `FrozenIndexTests.testFreezeEmptyIndexWithTranslogOps` test this trivial 
situation and they both fail 1 on 10 executions.

Relates to #33888
