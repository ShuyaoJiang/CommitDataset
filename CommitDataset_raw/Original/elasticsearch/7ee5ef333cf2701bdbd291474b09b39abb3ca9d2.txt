Add fields to `.logstash`'s mapping in template (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3872)

* Add fields to `.logstash`'s mapping in template

This "makes room" in the index for pipeline settings and node groups. Due to this change, users will be able to specify settings and node groups for a pipeline via the Centralized Config Management UI in Kibana. Logstash will only retrieve pipelines associated with the node group specified via the `xpack.management.group.id` setting in `logstash.yml`. For the retrieved pipelines, Logstash will apply any (optionally) specified pipeline settings before (re)loading the pipelines.

* Making field name more explicit + adding multi field for better search
