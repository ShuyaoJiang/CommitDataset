Do not preallocate bytes for channel buffer (#31400)

Currently, when we open a new channel, we pass it an
InboundChannelBuffer. The channel buffer is preallocated a single 16kb
page. However, there is no guarantee that this channel will be read from
anytime soon. Instead, this commit does not preallocate that page. That
page will be allocated when we receive a read event.
