[ML] Clean left behind model state docs (#30659)

It is possible for state documents to be
left behind in the state index. This may be
because of bugs or uncontrollable scenarios.
In any case, those documents may take up quite
some disk space when they add up. This commit
adds a step in the expired data deletion that
is part of the daily maintenance service. The
new step searches for state documents that
do not belong to any of the current jobs and
deletes them.

Closes #30551
