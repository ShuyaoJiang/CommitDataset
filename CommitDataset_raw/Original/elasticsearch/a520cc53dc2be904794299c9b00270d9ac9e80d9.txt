Always fail engine if delete operation fails (#40117)

Unlike index operations which can fail at the document level to
analyzing errors, delete operations should never fail at the document
level whether soft-deletes is enabled or not. With this change, we will
always fail the engine if we fail to apply a delete operation to Lucene.

Closes #33256
