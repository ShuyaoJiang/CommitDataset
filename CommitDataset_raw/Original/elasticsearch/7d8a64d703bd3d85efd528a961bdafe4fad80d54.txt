Move validation to server for put user requests (#32471)

This change moves the validation for values of usernames and passwords
from the request to the transport action. This is done to prevent
the need to move more classes into protocol once we add this API to the
high level rest client. Additionally, this resolves an issue where
validation depends on settings and we always pass empty settings
instead of the actual settings.
