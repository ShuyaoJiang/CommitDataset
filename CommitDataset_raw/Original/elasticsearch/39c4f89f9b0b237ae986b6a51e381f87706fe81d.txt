Move Watcher versioning setting to meta field (#30832)

The .watcher-history-* template is currently using a plugin-custom index setting xpack.watcher.template.version,
which prevents this template from being installed in a mixed OSS / X-Pack cluster, ultimately
leading to the situation where an X-Pack node is constantly spamming an OSS master with (failed)
template updates. Other X-Pack templates (e.g. security-index-template or security_audit_log)
achieve the same versioning functionality by using a custom _meta field in the mapping instead.
This commit switches the .watcher-history-* template to use the _meta field instead.
