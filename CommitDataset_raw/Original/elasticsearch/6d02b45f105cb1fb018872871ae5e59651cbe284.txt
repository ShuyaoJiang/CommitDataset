Support client-only mode for NioTransport (#25839)

Currently, NioTransport does start normal socket selectors and the
client when the network server setting is set to false. This commit
makes it so that the client will be started even when the network server
is not enabled.

Additionally, it randomly introduces the NioTransport as an option for
the MockTransportClient throughout tests.
