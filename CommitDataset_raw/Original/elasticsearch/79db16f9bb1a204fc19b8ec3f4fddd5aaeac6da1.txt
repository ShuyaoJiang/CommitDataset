[Docs] Add search timeout caveats (#33354)

Global search timeouts and timeouts specified in the search request body use the
same internal mechanism as search cancellation. Therefore the same caveats
apply, mostly around the responsiveness of the timeout which gets only checked
by a running search on segment boundaries by default.

Closes #31263
