Cancel GetDiscoveredNodesAction when bootstrapped (#36423)

Today the `GetDiscoveredNodesAction` waits, possibly indefinitely, to discover
enough nodes to bootstrap the cluster. However it is possible that the cluster
forms before a node has discovered the expected collection of nodes, in which
case the action will wait indefinitely despite the fact that it is no longer
required.

This commit changes the behaviour so that the action fails once a node receives
a cluster state with a nonempty configuration, indicating that the cluster has
been successfully bootstrapped and therefore the `GetDiscoveredNodesAction`
need wait no longer.
