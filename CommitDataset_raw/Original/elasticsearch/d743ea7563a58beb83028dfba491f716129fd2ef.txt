Add details about what acquired the shard lock last (#38807)

This adds a `details` parameter to shard locking in `NodeEnvironment`. This is
intended to be used for diagnosing issues such as

```
  1> [2019-02-11T14:34:19,262][INFO ][o.e.c.m.MetaDataDeleteIndexService] [node_s0] [.tasks/oSYOG0-9SHOx_pfAoiSExQ] deleting index

```

In the hope that we will be able to determine why the shard is still locked.

Relates to #30290 as well as some other CI failures
