Use stricter timer in DeadHostStateTests (#38301)

With this commit we add a monotonically strict timer to ensure time is
advancing even if the timer is called in a tight loop in tests. We also
relax a condition in a similar test so it only checks that time is not
moving backwards.

Closes #33747
