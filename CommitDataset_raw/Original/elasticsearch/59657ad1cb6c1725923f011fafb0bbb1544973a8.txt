Lazy initialize checkpoint tracker bit sets

This local checkpoint tracker uses collections of bit sets to track
which sequence numbers are complete, eventually removing these bit sets
when the local checkpoint advances. However, these bit sets were eagerly
allocated so that if a sequence number far ahead of the checkpoint was
marked as completed, all bit sets between the "last" bit set and the bit
set needed to track the marked sequence number were allocated. If this
sequence number was too far ahead, the memory requirements could be
excessive. This commit opts for a different strategy for holding on to
these bit sets and enables them to be lazily allocated.
