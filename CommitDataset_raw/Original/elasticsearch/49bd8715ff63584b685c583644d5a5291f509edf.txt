Inject Unfollow before Rollover and Shrink (#37625)

We inject an Unfollow action before Shrink because the Shrink action
cannot be safely used on a following index, as it may not be fully
caught up with the leader index before the "original" following index is
deleted and replaced with a non-following Shrunken index. The Unfollow
action will verify that 1) the index is marked as "complete", and 2) all
operations up to this point have been replicated from the leader to the
follower before explicitly disconnecting the follower from the leader.

Injecting an Unfollow action before the Rollover action is done mainly
as a convenience: This allow users to use the same lifecycle policy on
both the leader and follower cluster without having to explictly modify
the policy to unfollow the index, while doing what we expect users to
want in most cases.
