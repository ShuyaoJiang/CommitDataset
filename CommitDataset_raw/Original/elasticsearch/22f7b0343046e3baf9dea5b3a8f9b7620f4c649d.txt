Fix test reproducability in AbstractBuilderTestCase setup (#32403)

Currently AbstractBuilderTestCase generates certain random values in its
`beforeTest()` method annotated with @Before only the first time that a test
method in the suite is run while initializing the serviceHolder that we use for
the rest of the test. This changes the values of subsequent random values
and has the effect that when running single methods from a test suite with
"-Dtests.method=*", the random values it sees are different from when the same
test method is run as part of the whole test suite. This makes it hard to use
the reproduction lines logged on failure.

This change runs the inialization of the serviceHolder and the randomization 
connected to it using the test runners master seed, so reproduction by running
just one method is possible again.


Closes #32400
