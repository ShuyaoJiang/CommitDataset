Index ids in binary form. (#25352)

Indexing ids in binary form should help with indexing speed since we would
have to compare fewer bytes upon sorting, should help with memory usage of
the live version map since keys will be shorter, and might help with disk
usage depending on how efficient the terms dictionary is at compressing
terms.

Since we can only expect base64 ids in the auto-generated case, this PR tries
to use an encoding that makes the binary id equal to the base64-decoded id in
the majority of cases (253 out of 256). It also specializes numeric ids, since
this seems to be common when content that is stored in Elasticsearch comes
from another database that uses eg. auto-increment ids.

Another option could be to require base64 ids all the time. It would make things
simpler but I'm not sure users would welcome this requirement.

This PR should bring some benefits, but I expect it to be mostly useful when
coupled with something like #24615.

Closes #18154
