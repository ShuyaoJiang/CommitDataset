aggs: Allow aggregation sorting via nested aggregation.

The nested aggregator now buffers all bucket ords per parent document and
emits all bucket ords for a parent document's nested document once. This way
the nested documents document DocIdSetIterator gets used once per bucket
instead of wrapping the nested aggregator inside a multi bucket aggregator,
which was the current solution upto now. This allows sorting by buckets
under a nested bucket.

Closes #16838
