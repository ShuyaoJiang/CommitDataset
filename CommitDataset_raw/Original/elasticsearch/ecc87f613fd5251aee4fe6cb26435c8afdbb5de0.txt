Move pre-configured "keyword" tokenizer to the analysis-common module (#24863)

Moves the keyword tokenizer to the analysis-common module. The keyword tokenizer is special because it is used by CustomNormalizerProvider so I pulled it out into its own PR. To get the move to work I've reworked the lookup from static to one using the AnalysisRegistry. This seems safe enough.

Part of #23658.
