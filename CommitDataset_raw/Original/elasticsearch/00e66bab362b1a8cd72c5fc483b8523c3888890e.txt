[Elasticsearch Monitoring] Collect only display_name (for now) (#35265)

This is a forward port of some of the changes made in #8445, specifically the change mentioned in https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/34023#issuecomment-433212636.

Currently, in master, the `cluster_stats` collector collects _all_ cluster metadata and indexes it into `.monitoring-es-*`. However, per the discussion linked to above, we decided to collect _only_ the `display_name` cluster metadata setting for now. This PR makes this change.
