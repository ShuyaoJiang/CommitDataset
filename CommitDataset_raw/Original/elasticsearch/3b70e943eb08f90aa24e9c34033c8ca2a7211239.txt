add is-write-index flag to aliases (#30942)

This commit adds the is-write-index flag for aliases.
It allows requests to set the flag, and responses to display the flag.
It does not validate and/or affect any indexing/getting/updating behavior
of Elasticsearch -- this will be done in a follow-up PR.
