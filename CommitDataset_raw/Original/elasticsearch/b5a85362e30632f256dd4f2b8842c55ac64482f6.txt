Fix docs for fixed filename for heap dump path (#32882)

The docs here incorrectly state that it is okay for a heap dump file to
exist when heap dump path is configured to a fixed filename. This is
incorrect, the JVM will fail to write the heap dump if a heap dump file
already exists at the specified location (see the DumpWriter constructor
DumpWriter::DumpWriter(const char* path) in the JVM source).
