Update transport docs and settings for changes (#36786)

This is related to #36652. In 7.0 we plan to deprecate a number of
settings that make reference to the concept of a tcp transport. We
mostly just have a single transport type now (based on tcp). Settings
should only reference tcp if they are referring to socket options. This
commit updates the settings in the docs. And removes string usages of
the old settings. Additionally it adds a missing remote compress setting
to the docs.
