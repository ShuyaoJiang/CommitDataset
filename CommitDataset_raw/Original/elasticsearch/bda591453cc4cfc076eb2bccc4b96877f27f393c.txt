Add elasticsearch-node detach-cluster command (#37979)

This commit adds the second part of `elasticsearch-node` tool -
`detach-cluster` command in addition to `unsafe-bootstrap` command.
Also, this commit changes the semantics of `unsafe-bootstrap`, now
`unsafe-bootstrap` changes clusterUUID.
So the algorithm of running `elasticsearch-node` tool is the following:
1) Stop all nodes in the cluster.
2) Pick master-eligible node with the highest (term, version) pair and
run the `unsafe-bootstrap` command on it. If there are no survived
master-eligible nodes - skip this step.
3) Run `detach-cluster` command on the remaining survived nodes.

Detach cluster makes the following changes to the node metadata:
1) Sets clusterUUID committed to false.
2) Sets currentTerm and term to 0. 
3) Removes voting tombstones and sets voting configurations to special
constant MUST_JOIN_ELECTED_MASTER, that prevents initial cluster
bootstrap.

`ElasticsearchNodeCommand` base abstract class is introduced, because
`UnsafeBootstrapMasterCommand` and `DetachClusterCommand` have a lot in
common.
Also, this commit adds "ordinal" parameter to both commands, because it's 
impossible to write IT otherwise.
For MUST_JOIN_ELECTED_MASTER case special handling is introduced in
`ClusterFormationFailureHelper`.
Tests for both commands reside in `ElasticsearchNodeCommandIT` (renamed
from `UnsafeBootstrapMasterIT`).
