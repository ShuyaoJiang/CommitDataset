Add setting for the LDAP user search filter and deprecate user attribute (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1959)

This commit adds a setting to allow changing the user search filter. Previously the filter was a
simple equality filter that mapped a given attribute to the value of the username. The default
behavior remains the same with this change but provides additional flexibility to users to who may
need more advanced LDAP searches. The user attribute setting has been deprecated due to the overlap
with the new filter setting.
