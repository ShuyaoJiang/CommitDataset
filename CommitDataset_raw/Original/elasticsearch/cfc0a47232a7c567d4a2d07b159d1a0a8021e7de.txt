Core: Deprecate negative epoch timestamps (#36793)

Negative timestamps are currently supported in joda time. These are
dates before epoch. However, it doesn't really make sense to have a
negative timestamp, since this is a modern format. Any dates before
epoch can be represented with normal date formats, like ISO8601.
Additionally, implementing negative epoch timestamp parsing in java time
has an edge case which would more than double the code required. This
commit deprecates use of negative epoch timestamps.
