Simplify SSL server configuratin validation (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1826)

Today we have some hidden complexity related to default configurations
might specify NO_KEY which is in some cases valid for server configuration.
This change removes the leniencey paramenters on the validation methods and removes
obsolet asserts.
