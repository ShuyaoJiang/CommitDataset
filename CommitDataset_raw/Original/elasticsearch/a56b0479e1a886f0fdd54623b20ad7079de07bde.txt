Changed the chunk coordinator to process the chunks concurrently. (#3256)

The shard follow task executor determines the range of translog operations
between the leader shard's global checkpoint and the last know processed
seqno by the current shard follow task that are missing.

Then the chunks coordinator can then chunk this range up in smaller ranges
if the requested range is above the configured max chunk size. If it is
smaller than the entire range then the chunk coordinator has just one
chuck to coordinate.

Each chunk is added to a queue and is processed by the ChunkProcessor,
that reads the translog ops from the leader shard and then indexes
these translog ops into the follow shard. After that a new chuck is polled
from the queue and the ChunkProcessor performs the same actions until
there are no more chunks in the queue to process. After that the shard
follow task executor will determine a new range of translog operations
to process.

This change changes the chunk coordinator to start polling from the chunk
queue with multiple threads at the same time to handle dealing with a higher
indexing load on the leader side better.
