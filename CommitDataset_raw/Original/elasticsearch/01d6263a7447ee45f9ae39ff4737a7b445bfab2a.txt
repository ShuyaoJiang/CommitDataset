Fix DateFormatters.parseMillis when no timezone is given (#39100)

The parseMillis method was able to work on formats without timezones by
falling back to UTC. The Date Formatter interface did not support this, as
the calling code was using the `Instant.from` java time API.

This switches over to an internal method which adds UTC as a timezone.
