Use String.join() to describe a list of tasks (#28941)

This change replaces the use of string concatenation with a call to
String.join(). String concatenation might be quadratic, unless the compiler can
optimise it away, whereas String.join() is more reliably linear. There can
sometimes be a large number of pending ClusterState update tasks and #28920
includes a report that this operation sometimes takes a long time.
