SQL: Fix bug regarding alias fields with dots (#37279)

Field of types aliases that have dots in name are returned without a
hierarchy by field_caps, as oppose to the mapping api or field with
concrete types, which in turn breaks IndexResolver.
This commit fixes this by creating the backing hierarchy similar to the
mapping api.
