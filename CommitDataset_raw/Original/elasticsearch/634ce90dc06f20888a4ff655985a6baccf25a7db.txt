Respect cluster alias in `_index` aggs and queries (#25885)

Today when we aggregate on the `_index` field the cross cluster search
alias is not taken into account. Neither is it respected when we search
on the field. This change adds support for cluster alias when the cluster
alias is present on the `_index` field.

Closes #25606
