Carry over version map size to prevent excessive resizing (#27516)

Today we create a new concurrent hash map everytime we refresh
the internal reader. Under defaults this isn't much of a deal but
once the refresh interval is set to `-1` these maps grow quite large
and it can have a significant impact on indexing throughput. Under low
memory situations this can cause up to 2x slowdown. This change carries
over the map size as the initial capacity wich will be auto-adjusted once
indexing stops.

Closes #20498
