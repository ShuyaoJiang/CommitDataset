Add support for merging multiple search responses into one (#37566)

This will be used in cross-cluster search when reduction will be
performed locally on each cluster. The CCS coordinating node will send
one search request per remote cluster involved and will get one search
response back from each one of them. Such responses contain all the info
to be able to perform an additional reduction and return results back
to the user.
