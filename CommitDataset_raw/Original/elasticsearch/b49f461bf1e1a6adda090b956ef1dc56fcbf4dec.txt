Swithc to jcenter and hope to have fewer network failures in builds (#35427)

* Swithc to jcenter

Jcenter suposedly operates on a CDN.
It should be faster and more reliable.
It's the default in Andorid Studio currently
( it switched from mavenCentral ).

This change is safe because jcenter is a superset of mavenCentral.
