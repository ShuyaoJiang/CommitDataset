Core: Add methods to get locale/timezone in DateFormatter (#34113)

This adds some method into the `DateFormatter` interface, namely

* `withLocale()` to change the locale of a date formatter
* `getLocale()`
* `getZone()`
* `hashCode()`
* `equals()`

These methods will be needed for aggregations and mapping changes, where
zones and locales can be specified in the mapping or in search/aggs
parts of a search request.
