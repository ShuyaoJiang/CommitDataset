Fix rounding of time values near to overlapping days (#28151)

Sometimes, in some places, the clocks are set back across midnight, leading to
overlapping days. This was not handled as expected, and this change fixes this.

Additionally, in this situation it is not true that rounding a time down to the
nearest day is a monotonic operation, as asserted in these tests. This change 
suppresses those assertions in those rare cases.

Fixes #27966.
