Correctly set doc_count when MovAvg "predicts" values on existing buckets (#24892)

If the bucket already exists, due to non-overlapping series or missing data, the
MovAvg creates a merged bucket with the existing aggs + the new prediction.  This
fixes a small bug where the doc_count was not being set correctly.
