Remove http status code maps (#31350)

Currently we maintain a compatibility map of http status codes in both
the netty4 and nio modules. These maps convert a RestStatus to a netty
HttpResponseStatus. However, as these fundamentally represent integers,
we can just use the netty valueOf method to convert a RestStatus to a
HttpResponseStatus.
