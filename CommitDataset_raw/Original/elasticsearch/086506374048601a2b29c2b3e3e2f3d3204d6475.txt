SQL: Fix multi-line CLI commands to join correctly (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3516)

Previously multi-line CLI SQL statements were joined, but the space command was
missing, so a command like:

```
sql> SHOW
   | functions;
```

Would incorrectly parse as "showfunctions" and throw an error.

This fixes the behavior and adds a test for multi-line commands.

Resolves elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3410
