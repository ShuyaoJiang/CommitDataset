Skip shard deprecation messages in REST tests (#30630)

A 6.x node can send a deprecation message that the default number of
shards will change from five to one in 7.0.0. In a mixed cluster,
whether or not a create index request sees five or one shard and
produces a deprecation message depends on the version of the master
node. This means that during BWC tests a test can see this deprecation
message depending on the version of the master node. In 6.x when we
introduced this deprecation message we assumed that whereever we see
this deprecation message is expected. However, in a mixed cluster test
we need a similar mechanism but it would only apply if the version of
the master node is earlier than 7.0.0. This commit takes advantage of a
recent change to expose the version of the master node to do sections of
REST tests. With this in hand, we can skip asserting on the deprecation
message if the version of the master node is before 7.0.0 and otherwise
seeing that deprecation message would be completely unexpected.
