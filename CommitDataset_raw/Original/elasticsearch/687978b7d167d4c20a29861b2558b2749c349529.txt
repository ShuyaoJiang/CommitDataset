Reject all requests that have an unconsumed body (#37504)

This commit removes some leniency from REST handling where we move to
reject all requests that have a body where the body is not used during
the course of handling the request. For example,

DELETE /index
{
  "query" : {
    "term" :  {
      "field" : "value"
    }
  }
}

is now rejected.
