Enforce cluster UUIDs (#37775)

This commit adds join validation around cluster UUIDs, preventing a node to join a cluster if it was
previously part of another cluster. The commit introduces a new flag to the cluster state,
clusterUUIDCommitted, which denotes whether the node has locked into a cluster with the given
uuid. When a cluster is committed, this flag will turn to true, and subsequent cluster state updates
will keep the information about committal. Note that coordinating-only nodes are still free to switch
clusters at will (after restart), as they don't carry any persistent state.
