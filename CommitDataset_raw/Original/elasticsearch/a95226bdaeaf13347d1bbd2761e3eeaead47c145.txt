[Monitoring] Removing unused version.* fields (#33584)

This PR removes fields that are not actually used by the Monitoring UI. This will greatly simplify the eventual migration to using Metricbeat for monitoring Elasticsearch (see https://github.com/elastic/beats/pull/8260#discussion_r215885868 for more context and discussion around removing these fields from ES collection).
