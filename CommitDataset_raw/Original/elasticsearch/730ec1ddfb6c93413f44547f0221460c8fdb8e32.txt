Add more detailed OS name on Linux (#35352)

Today our OS information returned in node stats only returns a
high-level name of the OS (e.g., "Linux"). Yet, for some uses this is
too high-level and knowing at a finer level of granularity the
underlying OS can be useful. This commit extracts the pretty name on
Linux from /etc/os-release. This pretty name usually includes the Linux
vendor and the Linux vendor version number (e.g., Fedora 28).
