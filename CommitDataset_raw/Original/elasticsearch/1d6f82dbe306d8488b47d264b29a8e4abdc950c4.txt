[Monitoring] Remove Dedicated IndicesStatsCollector (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2192)

This removes the `IndicesStatsCollector` and, instead, it reuses the superset version of the call from the `IndexStatsCollector`.

On clusters with a large number of indices, this should actually help a good amount in reducing wasted calls and memory allocation without any difference in the output.
