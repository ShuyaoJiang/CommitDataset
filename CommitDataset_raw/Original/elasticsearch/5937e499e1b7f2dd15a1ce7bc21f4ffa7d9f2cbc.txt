Build analysis-icu client JAR (#33184)

This plugin needs to be able to be installed client side because it
contains doc values formats that can be returned to the transport
client. To keep this simple for developers, we publish the client JAR to
Maven so that they can depend on the plugin in their POM and install the
plugin there.
