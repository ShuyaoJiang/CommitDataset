Never leave stale delete tombstones in version map (#29619)

Today the VersionMap does not clean up a stale delete tombstone if it
does not require safe access. However, in a very rare situation due to
concurrent refreshes, the safe-access flag may be flipped over then an
engine accidentally consult that stale delete tombstone.

This commit ensures to never leave stale delete tombstones in a version
map by always pruning delete tombstones when putting a new index entry
regardless of the value of the safe-access flag.
