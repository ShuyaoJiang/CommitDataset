[ML] Increase tokenization flexibility for categorization (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3372)

By moving tokenization for categorization to Java we give users access to considerably more options for tokenizing their log messages prior to using ML to categorize them. Now all Elasticsearch analyzer functionality is available, which opens up the possibility to sensibly categorize non-English log messages.
