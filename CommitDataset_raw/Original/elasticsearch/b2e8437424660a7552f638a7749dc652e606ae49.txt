Tests: Add ElasticsearchAssertions.awaitLatch method (#36777)

* Tests: Add ElasticsearchAssertions.awaitLatch method

Some tests are using assertTrue(latch.await(...)) in their code. This
leads to an assertion error without any error message. This adds a
method which has a nicer error message and can be used in tests.

* fix forbidden apis

* fix spaces
