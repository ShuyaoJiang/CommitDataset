Remove platform test command (#40280)

The platformTest gradle task was a packaging test meant to ensure unit
tests run on the various supported operating systems without relying on
CI to maintain a full matrix of platforms. Howevever, it never really
worked out as intended and is now additional code in our vagrant setup
to maintain. This commit removes the platformTest task.
