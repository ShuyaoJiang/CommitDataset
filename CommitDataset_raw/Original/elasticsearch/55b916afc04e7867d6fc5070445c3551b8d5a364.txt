Ensure task metadata not null in follow test (#37993)

This commit fixes a potential race in the IndexFollowingIT. Currently it
is possible that we fetch the task metadata, it is null, and that throws
a null pointer exception. Assertbusy does not catch null pointer
exceptions. This commit assertions that the metadata is not null.
