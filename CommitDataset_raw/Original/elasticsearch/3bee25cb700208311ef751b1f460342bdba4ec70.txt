[GEO] Add support to ShapeBuilders for building Lucene geometry (#35707)

* [GEO] Add support to ShapeBuilders for building Lucene geometry

This commit adds support for building lucene geometry from the ShapeBuilders.
This is needed for integrating LatLonShape as the primary indexing approach
for geo_shape field types. All unit and integration tests are updated to
add randomization for testing both jts/s4j shapes and lucene shapes.
