[ML] Add ML filter update API (#31437)

This adds an api to allow updating a filter:

POST _xpack/ml/filters/{filter_id}/_update

The request body may have:

- description: setting a new description
- add_items: a list of the items to add
- remove_items: a list of the items to remove

This commit also changes the PUT filter api to
error when the filter_id is already used. As
now there is an api for updating filters, the
put api should only be used to create new ones.

Also, updating a filter results into a notification
message auditing the change for every job that is
using that filter.
