Remove `TcpChannel#setSoLinger` method (#35924)

This commit removes the dedicated `setSoLinger` method. This simplifies
the `TcpChannel` interface. This method has very little effect as the
SO_LINGER is not set prior to the channels being closed in the abstract
transport test case. We still will set SO_LINGER on the
`MockNioTransport`. However we can do this manually.
