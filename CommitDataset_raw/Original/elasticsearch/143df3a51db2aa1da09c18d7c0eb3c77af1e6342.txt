Test: remove hardcoded list of unconfigured ciphers (#30367)

This commit removes the hardcoded list of unconfigured ciphers in the
SslIntegrationTests. This list may include ciphers that are not
supported on certain JVMs. This list is replaced with code that
dynamically computes the set of ciphers that are not configured for
use by default.
