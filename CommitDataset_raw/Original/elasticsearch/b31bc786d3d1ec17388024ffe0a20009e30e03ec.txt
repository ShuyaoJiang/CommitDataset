Remove isValidIndex from SQL's Catalog interface (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2195)

This moves validating that each index contains only a single type
into EsCatalog which removes a race condition and removes a method
from the Catalog interface. Removing methods from the Catalog
interface is nice because the fewer methods that the interface has
the fewer have to be secured.
