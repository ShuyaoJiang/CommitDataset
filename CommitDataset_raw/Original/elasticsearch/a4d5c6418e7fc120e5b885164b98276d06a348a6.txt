percolator: Rename map_unmapped_fields_as_string setting to map_unmapped_fields_as_text

The `index.percolator.map_unmapped_fields_as_text` is a more better name, because unmapped fields are mapped to a text field with default settings
and string is no longer a field type (it is either keyword or text).
