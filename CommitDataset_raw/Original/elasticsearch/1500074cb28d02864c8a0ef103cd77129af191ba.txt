[ML] Add method to find the established memory use for a job (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2449)

"Established" memory use will be one of the building blocks for smarter node
allocation.

In order for a job to be considered to have established memory usage it must:
- Have generated at least 20 buckets of results
- Have generated at least one model size stats document
- Have low variability of model bytes in model size stats documents in the
  time period covered by the last 20 buckets, which is defined as having a
  coefficient of variation of no more than 0.1
