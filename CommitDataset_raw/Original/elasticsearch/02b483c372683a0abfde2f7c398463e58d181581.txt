Logging improvements in CoordinatorTests (#33991)

Today, we know that CoordinatorTests sometimes fail to stabilise due to an
election collision. This change improves the logging that occurs when an
election collision occurs so it will be easier to see if this is happening when
analysing a test failure. We also wrap the call to
masterService.submitStateUpdateTask() in a context that logs the node on which
it runs.

We also introduce the InitialJoinAccumulator instead of using a placeholder
CandidateJoinAccumulator at startup, which reduces the cases to consider in
CandidateJoinAccumulator.close() and tightens up the assertions we can make
here.
