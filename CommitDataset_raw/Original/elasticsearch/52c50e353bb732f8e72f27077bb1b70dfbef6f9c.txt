Do not add noop from local translog to translog again (#29637)

Today we always add no-ops to translog regardless of its origin, thus a
noop may appear in the translog multiple times. This is not a big deal
as noops are small and rare to appear.

This commit ensures to add a noop to translog only if its origin is not
from local translog. This restriction has been applied for index and
delete.
