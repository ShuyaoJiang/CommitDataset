Re-deprecate xpack rollup endpoints (#36451)

Redeprecates the `/_xpack/rollup` endpoints in favor of `/_rollup`.

When we cleanup the rollup in a cluster containing 6.x nodes we need to
use `/_xpack/rollup` instead of `/_rollup` because the 6.x nodes don't
know about `/_rollup`. In those cases we must ignore the deprecation
warnings that the 7.0 node will return for the end point.

Closes #36044
