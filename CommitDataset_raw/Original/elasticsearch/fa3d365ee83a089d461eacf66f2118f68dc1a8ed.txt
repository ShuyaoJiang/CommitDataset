Fix CompositeBytesReference#slice to not throw AIOOBE with legal offsets. (#35955)

CompositeBytesReference#slice has two bugs:
 - One that makes it fail if the reference is empty and an empty slice is
   created, this is #35950 and is fixed by special-casing empty-slices.
 - One performance bug that makes it always create a composite slice when
   creating a slice that ends on a boundary, this is fixed by computing `limit`
   as the index of the sub reference that holds the last element rather than
   the next element after the slice.

Closes #35950
