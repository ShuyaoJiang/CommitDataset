TESTS: Make score Float#NaN when there is no max score (#33997)

* TESTS: Make score Float#NaN when there is no max score

Fixes test failure due to maxScore set to Float#MinValue instead
on Float#NaN. In addition the initial value for maxScore is set to
Float#NEGATIVE_INFINITY so it is an illegal value.

Closes #33993
