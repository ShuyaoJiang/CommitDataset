Remove transport name from tcp channel (#40074)

Currently, we maintain a transport name ("mock-nio", "nio", "netty")
that is passed to a `TcpTransportChannel` when a request is received.
The value of this name is to associate with the task when we register a
task with the task manager. However, it is only possible to run ES with
one transport, so having an implementation specific name is unnecessary.
This commit removes the name and replaces it with the generic
"transport".
