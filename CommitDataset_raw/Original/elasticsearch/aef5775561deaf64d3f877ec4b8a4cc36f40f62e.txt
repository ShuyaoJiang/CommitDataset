re-enables awaitsfixed datemath tests (#38376)

Previously, date formats of `YYYY.MM.dd` would hit an issue
where the year would jump towards the end of the calendar year.
This was an issue that had since been resolved in tests by using
`yyyy` to be the more accurate representation of the year.

Closes #37037.
