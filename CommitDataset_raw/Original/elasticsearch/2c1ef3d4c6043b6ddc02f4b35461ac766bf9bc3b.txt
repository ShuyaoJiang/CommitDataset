Do not renew sync-id if all shards are sealed (#29103)

Today the synced-flush always issues a new sync-id even though all
shards haven't been changed since the last seal. This causes active
shards to have different a sync-id from offline shards even though all
were sealed and no writes since then.

This commit adjusts not to renew sync-id if all active shards are sealed
with the same sync-id.

Closes #27838
