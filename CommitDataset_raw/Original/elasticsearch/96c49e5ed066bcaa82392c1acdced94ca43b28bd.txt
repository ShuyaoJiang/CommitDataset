[CCR] Improve shard follow task's retryable error handling (#33371)

Improve failure handling of retryable errors by retrying remote calls in
a exponential backoff like manner. The delay between a retry would not be
longer than the configured max retry delay. Also retryable errors will be
retried indefinitely.
