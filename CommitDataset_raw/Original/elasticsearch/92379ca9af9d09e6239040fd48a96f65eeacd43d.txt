Watcher: Ensure usage stats work properly in distributed environment (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4094)

This adds back usage stats by pickybacking on the watcher stats, which
are already running distributed in order to collect and merge watcher
statistics.

In order to be able to track statistics, we need to add information for
each watch in an in-memory data structure that is processed whenever a
usage request is coming in. This processing creates a number of counters
for each node, which then are merged together in the usage stats.
