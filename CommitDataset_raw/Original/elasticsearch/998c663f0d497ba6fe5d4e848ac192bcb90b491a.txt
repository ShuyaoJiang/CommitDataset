Add Tests for findSamlRealm (#35905)

This commit adds a test for handling correctly all they possible 
`SamlPrepareAuthenticationRequest` parameter combinations that 
we might get from Kibana or a custom web application talking to the
SAML APIs. 
We can match the correct SAML realm based either on the realm name
or the ACS URL. If both are included in the request then both need to 
match the realm configuration.
