[ML] Add created_by info to usage stats (#40518)

This change adds information about which UI path
(if any) created ML anomaly detector jobs to the
stats returned by the _xpack/usage endpoint.

Counts for the following possibilities are expected:

* ml_module_apache_access
* ml_module_apm_transaction
* ml_module_auditbeat_process_docker
* ml_module_auditbeat_process_hosts
* ml_module_nginx_access
* ml_module_sample
* multi_metric_wizard
* population_wizard
* single_metric_wizard
* unknown

The "unknown" count is for jobs that do not have a
created_by setting in their custom_settings.

Closes #38403
