Security: use default scroll keepalive (#33639)

Security previously hardcoded a default scroll keepalive of 10 seconds,
but in some cases this is not enough time as there can be network
issues or overloading of host machines. After this change, security
will now use the default keepalive timeout, which is controllable using
a setting and the default value is 5 minutes.
