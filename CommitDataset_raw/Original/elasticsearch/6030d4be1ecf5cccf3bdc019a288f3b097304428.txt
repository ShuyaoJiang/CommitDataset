[INGEST] Interrupt the current thread if evaluation grok expressions take too long (#31024)

This adds a thread interrupter that allows us to encapsulate calls to org.joni.Matcher#search()
This method can hang forever if the regex expression is too complex.

The thread interrupter in the background checks every 3 seconds whether there are threads
execution the org.joni.Matcher#search() method for longer than 5 seconds and
if so interrupts these threads.

Joni has checks that that for every 30k iterations it checks if the current thread is interrupted and
if so returns org.joni.Matcher#INTERRUPTED

Closes #28731
