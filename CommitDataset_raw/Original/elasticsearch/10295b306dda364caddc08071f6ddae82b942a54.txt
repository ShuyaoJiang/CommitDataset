Core: Drop nodeName from AbstractComponent (#34487)

`AbstractComponent` is trouble because its name implies that
*everything* should extend from it. It *is* useful, but maybe too
broadly useful. The things it offers access too, the `Settings` instance
for the entire server and a logger are nice to have around, but not
really needed *everywhere*. The `Settings` instance especially adds a
fair bit of ceremony to testing without any value.

This removes the `nodeName` method from `AbstractComponent` so it is
more clear where we actually need the node name.
