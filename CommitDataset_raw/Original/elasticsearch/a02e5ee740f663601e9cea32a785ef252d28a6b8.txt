Painless: Complete Removal of Painless Type (#31699)

This completes the removal of Painless Type. The new data structures in the definition are a map of names (String) to Java Classes and a map of Java Classes to Painless Structs. The names to Java Classes map can contain a 2 to 1 ratio of names to classes depending on whether or not a short (imported) name is used. The Java Classes to Painless Structs is 1 to 1 always where the Java Class name must match the Painless Struct name. This should lead a significantly simpler type system in Painless moving forward since the Painless Type only held redundant information since Painless does not support generics.
