`manage_token` privilege for `kibana_system`

Creates the manage_token cluster privilege and adds it to the
kibana_system role. This is required if kibana were to use the token
service for its authenticator process.
Because kibana_system already has manage_saml this effectively
only adds the privilege to create tokens.
