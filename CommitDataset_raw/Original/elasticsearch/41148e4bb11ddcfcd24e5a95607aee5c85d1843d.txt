Docs: Update HighLevelRestClient migration docs (#30544)

The High Level REST Client's documentation suggested that users should
use the Low Level REST Client for index management activities. This
change removes that suggestion because the high level REST client
supports those APIs now.

This also changes the examples in the migration docs to that still use
the Low Level REST Client to use the non-deprecated varieats of
`performRequest`.
