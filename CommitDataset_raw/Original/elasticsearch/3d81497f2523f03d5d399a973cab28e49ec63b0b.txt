REST: Clear Indices Cache API remove deprecated url params (#29068)

By the time the master branch is released the deprecated url
parameters in the `/_cache/clear` API will have been deprecated
for a couple of minor releases. Since master will be the next
major release we are fine with removing these parameters.
