Add support for switching distribution for all integration tests (#30874)

* remove left-over comment

* make sure of the property for plugins

* skip installing modules if these exist in the distribution

* Log the distrbution being ran

* Don't allow running with integ-tests-zip passed externally

* top level x-pack/qa can't run with oss distro

* Add support for matching objects in lists

Makes it possible to have a key that points to a list and assert that a
certain object is present in the list. All keys have to be present and
values have to match. The objects in the source list may have additional
fields.

example:
```
  match:  { 'nodes.$master.plugins': { name: ingest-attachment }  }
```

* Update plugin and module tests to work with other distributions

Some of the tests expected that the integration tests will always be ran
with  the `integ-test-zip` distribution so that there will be no other
plugins loaded.

With this change, we check for the presence of the plugin without
assuming exclusivity.

* Allow modules to run on other distros as well

To match the behavior of tets.distributions

* Add and use a new `contains` assertion

Replaces the  previus changes that caused `match` to do a partial match.

* Implement PR review comments
