[ML] UpdateProcessNotifier should drain the update queue (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3774)

The notifier is scheduled to run once per second. Currently,
it simply polls for the next update in the queue. However,
when there are multiple updates queued up, there is no
reason to wait for subsequent runs in order to execute the
rest of the updates.

This commit changes the notifier to drain the queue each time
it runs. It then serially executes the updates.
