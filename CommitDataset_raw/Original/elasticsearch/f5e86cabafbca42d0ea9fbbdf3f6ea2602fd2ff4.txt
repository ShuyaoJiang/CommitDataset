Move PkiRealm checks for SSL and client authentication to a bootstrap check (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1442)

This commit cleans up the check for SSL with client authentication when a PKI realm is enabled by
moving it from the realm to a actual bootstrap check.

A bug was found during this cleanup in the check for transport profiles and that is also fixed in
this commit.
