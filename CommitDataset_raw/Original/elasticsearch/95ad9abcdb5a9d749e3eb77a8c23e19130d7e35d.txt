Fixes IndiceOptionsTests to serialise correctly (#30644)

* Fixes IndiceOptionsTests to serialise correctly

Previous to this change `IndicesOptionsTests.testSerialisation()` would
select a complete random version for both the `StreamOutput` and the
`StreamInput`. This meant that the output could be selected as 7.0+
while the input was selected as <7.0 causing the stream to be written
in the new format and read in teh old format (or vica versa). This
change splits the two cases into different test methods ensuring that
the Streams are at least on compatibile versions even if they are on
different versions.

* Use same random version for input and output streams
