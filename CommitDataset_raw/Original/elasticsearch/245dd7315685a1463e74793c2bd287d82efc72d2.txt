Bulk processor#awaitClose to close scheduler (#29263)

When the `BulkProcessor` is used with the high-level REST client, a scheduler is internally created that allows to schedule tasks. Such scheduler is not exposed to users and needs to be closed once the `BulkProcessor` is closed. There are two ways to close the `BulkProcessor` though, one is the ordinary `close` method and the other one is `awaitClose`. The former closes the scheduler while the latter doesn't, leaving threads lingering.
