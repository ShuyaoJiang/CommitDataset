Reindex: Raise timeout on flaky test

This gives the test longer to block its updates. Now that we're checking
if the updates actually blocked saw that they may not do so in the
normal 10 seconds on a highly loaded system. And our jenkins machines
often function like highly loaded systems. Maybe this fixes #26758!
