Use custom index metadata for ILM state (#33783)

Using index settings for ILM state is fragile and exposes too much
information that doesn't need to be exposed. Using custom index metadata
is more resilient and allows more controlled access to internal
information.

As part of these changes, moves away from using defaults for ILM-related
values, in favor of using null values to clearly indicate that the value is not
present.
