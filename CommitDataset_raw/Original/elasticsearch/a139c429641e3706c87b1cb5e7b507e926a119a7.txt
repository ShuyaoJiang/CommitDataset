Build: Fix test task to explicitly depend on testClasses task (#28490)

Gradle 4.5 now hides immutable task dependencies. We previously copied
the existing dependencies from the builtin test task to the
randomizedtesting task. This commit adds testClasses as an extra
dependency of the randomizedtesting task, to ensure the classes are
built.
