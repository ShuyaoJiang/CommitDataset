Throw an exception when unable to read Certificate (#40092)

With SUN security provider, a CertificateException is thrown when
attempting to parse a Certificate from a PEM file on disk with
`sun.security.provider.X509Provider#parseX509orPKCS7Cert`

When using the BouncyCastle Security provider (as we do in fips
tests) the parsing happens in
CertificateFactory#engineGenerateCertificates which doesn't throw
an exception but returns an empty list.

In order to have a consistent behavior, this change makes it so
that we throw a CertificateException when attempting to read
a PEM file from disk and failing to do so in either Security
Provider
