[ML] Move consuming and closing results stream to result processor (#36314)

The results iterator is consuming and closing the results stream
once it is done. It seems this should not be the responsibility
of the results iterator. It stops the iterator from being reusable
for different processes where closing the stream is not desirable.
This commit is moving the consuming and closing of the results stream
into the autodetect result processor.
