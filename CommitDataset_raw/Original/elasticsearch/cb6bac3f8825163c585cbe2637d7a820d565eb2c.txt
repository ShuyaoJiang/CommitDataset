Skip final reduction if SearchRequest holds a cluster alias (#37000)

With #36997 we added the ability to provide a cluster alias with a
SearchRequest.

The next step is to disable the final reduction whenever a cluster alias
is provided with the SearchRequest. A cluster alias will be provided
when executing a cross-cluster search request with alternate execution
mode, where each cluster does its own reduction locally. In order for
the CCS node to be able to later perform an additional reduction of the
results, we need to make sure that all the needed info stays available.
This means that terms aggregations can be reduced but not pruned, and
pipeline aggs should not be executed. The final reduction will happen
later in the CCS coordinating node.
