Remove assertion about deviation when casting to a float. (#25806)

We cannot guarantee that the result of computations will be in the float range,
since it depends on the data and how scores are computed. We already use doubles
as intermediate representations and cast to a float as a final step, which is
the right thing to do. Small doubles will just be rounded to zero, there is not
much we can or should do about it.
