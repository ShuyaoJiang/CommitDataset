Disable security for trial licenses by default (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4120)

This change disables security for trial licenses unless security is
explicitly enabled in the settings. This is done to facilitate users
getting started and not having to deal with some of the complexities
involved in getting security configured. In order to do this and avoid
disabling security for existing users that have gold or platinum
licenses, we have to disable security after cluster formation so that
the license can be retrieved.
