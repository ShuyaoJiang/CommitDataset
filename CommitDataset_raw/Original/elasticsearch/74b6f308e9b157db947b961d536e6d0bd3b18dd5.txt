SQL: Fix issue with complex expression as args of PERCENTILE/_RANK (#37102)

When the arguements of PERCENTILE and PERCENTILE_RANK can be folded,
the `ConstantFolding` rule kicks in and calls the `replaceChildren()`
method on `InnerAggregate` which is created from the aggregation rules
of the `Optimizerz. `InnerAggregate` in turn, cannot implement the method
as the logic of creating a new `InnerAggregate` instance from a list of
`Expression`s resides in the Optimizer. So, instead, `ConstantFolding`
should be applied before any of the aggregations related rules.
