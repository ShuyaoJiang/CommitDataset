Change missing authn message to not mention tokens (#36750)

The phrase "missing authentication token" is historic and is based
around the use of "AuthenticationToken" objects inside the Realm code.

However, now that we have a TokenService and token API, this message
would sometimes lead people in the wrong direction and they would try
and generate a "token" for authentication purposes when they would
typically just need a username:password Basic Auth header.

This change replaces the word "token" with "credentials".
