In MatchQuery, remove a check for fragile search analyzers. (#33927)

As far as I can tell this guard against fragile analyzers is no longer relevant, since
we stopped setting special analyzers on numeric fields (3bf6f4). Instead of removing
the guard completely, I opted to keep a check for untokenized + unnormalized fields
to avoid going through the analysis process unnecessarily.

My motivation for simplifying this check is that I'd like to add support for
`split_queries_on_whitespace` to the new 'queryable object' fields. As it stands, I would
have to add a dedicated instanceof check for the new mapper, which is not optimal.
