Fix ClusterInfoServiceIT timeouts (#36758)

The test testClusterInfoServiceInformationClearOnError relies on timing behavior. It sets
InternalClusterInfoService.INTERNAL_CLUSTER_INFO_TIMEOUT_SETTING to 1s and relies on the
fact that the stats request completes within that timeframe (which our ever-so-slow CI seems to
violate at times). Unfortunately the logging has been misimplemented in InternalClusterInfoService,
so the corresponding log messages showing that the requests have timed out are missing for this.
The issue can be locally reproduced by reducing the timeout to something lower.

Closes #36554
