Test: fix skip check for EllipticCurveSSLTests (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3771)

This change fixes the skip check for the EllipticCurveSSLTests. The skip check that is in the test
was added to proctect against failures on JVMs that do not support EC ciphers such as the packaged
openjdk in some linux distributions. The old skip check did not execute until the cluster was up
so the test would still fail with errors such as no cipher suites in common. This change moves the
check into a before class method that checks availability.
