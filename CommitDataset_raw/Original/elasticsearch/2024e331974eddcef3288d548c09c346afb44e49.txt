Integrate retention leases to recovery from remote (#38829)

This commit is the first step in integrating shard history retention
leases with CCR. In this commit we integrate shard history retention
leases with recovery from remote. Before we start transferring files, we
take out a retention lease on the primary. Then during the file copy
phase, we repeatedly renew the retention lease. Finally, when recovery
from remote is complete, we disable the background renewing of the
retention lease.
