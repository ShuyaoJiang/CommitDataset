[Geo] Integrate Lucene's LatLonShape (BKD Backed GeoShapes) as default `geo_shape` indexing approach (#36751)

* [Geo] Expose BKDBackedGeoShapes as new VECTOR strategy

This commit exposes lucene's LatLonShape field as a new
strategy in GeoShapeFieldMapper. To use the new indexing
approach, strategy should be set to "vector" in the
geo_shape field mapper. If the tree parameter is set
the mapper will throw an IAE. Note the following:

When using vector strategy:

* geo_shape query does not support querying by POINT,
MULTIPOINT, or GEOMETRYCOLLECTION.
* LINESTRING and MULTILINESTRING queries do not support
WITHIN relation.
* CONTAINS relation is not supported.
* The tree, precision, tree_levels, distance_error_pct,
and points_only parameters will not throw an exception
but they have no effect and will be marked as
deprecated..

All other features are supported.

* revert change to PercolatorFieldMapper

* fix ExistsQuery for geo_shape vector strategy

* add deprecation logging for tree, precision, tree_levels, distance_error_pct, and points_only

* initial update to geoshape docs, including mapping migration updates

* initial support for GeoCollection queries

* fix docs and javadoc errors

* clean up geocollection queries

* set deprecated mapping tests to NOTCONSOLE

* fix geo-shape mapper asciidoc mapping and test warnings

* add support for point queries using LatLonShapeBoundingBoxQuery

* update GeoShapeQueryBuilderTests to include POINT queries for VECTOR strategy. Other comment cleanups

* add lucene geometry build testing to ShapeBuilder tests

* remove deprecated prefix tree mapping from geo-shape.asciidoc

* refactor GeoShapeFieldMapper into LegacyGeoShapeFieldMapper and GeoShapeFieldMapper

Both classes derive from BaseGeoShapeFieldMapper that provides shared parameters:
coerce, ignoreMalformed, ignore_z_value, orientation.

* update docs to remove vector strategy

* fix GeometryCollectionBuilder#buildLucene to return the object created by the shape builder

* fix LineLength failure in GeoJsonShapeParserTests

* ShapeMapper refactor changes from PR feedback

* fix typo in geo-shape.asciidoc

* ignore circle test in docs

* update indexing-approach ref to geoshape-indexing-approach

* add warnings check for LegacyGeoShapeFieldMapper to AbstractBuilderTestCase

* fix deprecatedParameters setup

* update indexing approach

* fixing unexpected warnings failures

* move orientation back to field type

* remove if in LegacyGeoShapeFieldMapper#doXContent. Fix GeoShapeFieldMapper to work with double array as a point

* fix indexing-approach link in circle section of geoshape docs

* add strategy to deprecation warnings check

* fix test failures

* fix typo in QueryStringQueryBuilderTests

* fix total hits to totalHits().value

* fix version number

* add version check to BaseGeoShapeFieldMapper

* fix line length!

* revert version check in BaseGeoShapeFieldMapper

* Fix serialization of mappings of legacy shapes.
