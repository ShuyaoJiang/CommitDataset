Scripting: Conditionally use java time api in scripting (#31441)

This commit adds a boolean system property, `es.scripting.use_java_time`,
which controls the concrete return type used by doc values within
scripts. The return type of accessing doc values for a date field is
changed to Object, essentially duck typing the type to allow
co-existence during the transition from joda time to java time.
