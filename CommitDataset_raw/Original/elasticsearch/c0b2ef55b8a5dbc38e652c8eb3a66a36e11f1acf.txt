Docs: Explain _bulk?refresh shard targeting

Only the shards that receive the bulk request will be affected by
`refresh`. Imagine a `_bulk?refresh=wait_for` request with three
documents in it that happen to be routed to different shards in an index
with five shards. The request will only wait for those three shards to
refresh. The other two shards of that make up the index do not
participate in the `_bulk` request at all.
