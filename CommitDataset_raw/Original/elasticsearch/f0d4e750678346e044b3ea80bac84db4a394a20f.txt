[ML][TEST] Fix failing test testPersistJobOnGracefulShutdown_givenTimeAdvancedAfterNoNewData (#40363)

Ensure that there is at least a 1s delay between the time that state
is persisted by each of the two jobs in the test.

Model snapshot IDs use the current time in epoch seconds to
distinguish themselves, hence snapshots will be overwritten
by another if it occurs in the same 1s window.

Closes #40347
