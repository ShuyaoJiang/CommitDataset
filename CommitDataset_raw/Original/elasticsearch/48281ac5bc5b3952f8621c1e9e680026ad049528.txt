Use generic AcknowledgedResponse instead of extended classes (#32859)

This removes custom Response classes that extend `AcknowledgedResponse` and do nothing, these classes are not needed and we can directly use the non-abstract super-class instead.

While this appears to be a large PR, no code has actually changed, only class names have been changed and entire classes removed.
