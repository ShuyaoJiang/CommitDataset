meta-plugin should install bin and config at the top level (#28162)

This change modifies the installation for a meta plugin,
the content of the config and bin directory inside each bundled plugins are now moved in the meta plugin directory.
So instead of `$configDir/meta-plugin-name/bundled_plugin/name/` the content of the config
for a bundled plugin is now in `$configDir/meta-plugin-name`. Same applies for the bin directory.
