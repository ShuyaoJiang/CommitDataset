Use ESBlobStoreRepositoryIntegTestCase to test the repository-s3 plugin (#29315)

This commit adds the S3BlobStoreRepositoryTests class that extends the
base testing class for S3. It also removes some usage of socket servers 
that emulate socket connections in unit tests. It was added to trigger 
security exceptions, but this won't be needed anymore since #29296 
is merged.
