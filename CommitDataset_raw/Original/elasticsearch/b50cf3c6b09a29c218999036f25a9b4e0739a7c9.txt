Side-step pending deletes check (#30571)

When we split/shrink an index we open several IndexWriter instances
causeing file-deletes to be pending on windows. This subsequently fails
when we open an IW to bootstrap the index history due to pending deletes.
This change sidesteps the check since we know our history goes forward
in terms of files and segments.

Closes #30416
