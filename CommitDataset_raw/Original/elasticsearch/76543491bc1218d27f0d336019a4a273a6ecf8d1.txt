SQL: Soften NOCOMMIT to TODO

I'm adding this to the SQL tracker issue. It is more low priority
but we should think about doing it before merging because it is
fairly easy:

Exceptions have many constructors that take a string pattern and
arguments. These kinds of things have mostly been removed in core
because we prefer explicitly building the message at the call site
for clarity. We should probably remove these constructors because
it is easy and another way that we can be more like core quickly.
