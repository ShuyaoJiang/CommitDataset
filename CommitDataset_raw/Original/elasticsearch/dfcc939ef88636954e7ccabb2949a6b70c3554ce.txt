QA: Better seed nodes for rolling restart

Use all running nodes as unicast seeds in the rolling restart tests to
avoid a race between pinging and the tests. Without this if the tests
are too fast then when a new node comes up and pings its single
configured seed node that node *might* not have a ping from the other
running node.
