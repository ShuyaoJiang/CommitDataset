Disable testClusterJoinDespiteOfPublishingIssues for Zen2

This test is failing sometimes with Zen2 due to the lack of lag detection.
Zen1 does not have this problem as it only considers a join as valid if the
corresponding cluster state update is successfully published and committed
on the joining node.
