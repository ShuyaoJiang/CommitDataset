Plugins: Store elasticsearch and java versions in PluginInfo (#28556)

Plugin descriptors currently contain an elasticsearch version,
which the plugin was built against, and a java version, which the plugin
was built with. These versions are read and validated, but not stored.
This commit keeps them in PluginInfo so they can be used later.
While seeing the elasticsearch version is less interesting (since it is
enforced to match that of the running elasticsearc node), the java
version is interesting since we only validate the format, not the actual
version. This also makes PluginInfo have full parity with the plugin
properties file.
