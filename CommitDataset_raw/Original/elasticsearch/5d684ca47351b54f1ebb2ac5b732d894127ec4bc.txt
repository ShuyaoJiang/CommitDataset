Combine the execution of an exclusive replica operation with primary term update (#36116)

This commit changes how an operation which requires all index shard 
operations permits is executed when a primary term update is required: 
the operation and the update are combined so that the operation is 
executed after the primary term update under the same blocking 
operation.

Closes #35850
