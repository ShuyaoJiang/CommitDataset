HLREST: Bundle the x-pack protocol project (#31904)

The `:x-pack:protocol` project is an implementation detail shared by the
xpack projects and the high level rest client and really doesn't deserve
its own maven coordinants and published javadoc. This change bundles
`:x-pack:protocol` into the high level rest client.

Relates to #29827
