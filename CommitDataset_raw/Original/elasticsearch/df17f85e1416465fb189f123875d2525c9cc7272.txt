Remove Discovery.AckListener.onTimeout() (#30514)

The MasterService takes responsibility for timeouts of the AckListeners that it
creates, and the rest of the Discovery subsystem is unaware of these timeouts,
so there's no need for this to appear in the Discovery.AckListener interface.

Also fix a typo in the name of DelegatingAckListener.
