Watcher: Remove REST hijacking operations (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2132)

As all the triggering is now done on the shards, people can use
bulk, *-by-query and regular index/delete operations on the watcher
index and do not need to use the dedicated APIs.

We can now remove the long existing rest operation hijacking code.
