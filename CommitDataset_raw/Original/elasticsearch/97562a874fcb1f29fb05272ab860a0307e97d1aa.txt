Configure TMP for test nodes on Windows (#39959)

This breaks on windows where TMP dir default to C:\Windows and startup
fails with a permission error.
I tried to create a tmp dir and pass in `TMP` env, but it lead to a
class not found error, and since testclusers is already independent of
the calling environment I stopped there.
