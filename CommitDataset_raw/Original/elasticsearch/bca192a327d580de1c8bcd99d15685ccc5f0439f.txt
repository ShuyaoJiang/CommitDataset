Simplify TranslogWriter#closeWithTragicEvent (#29412)

This commit simplifies the exception handling in
TranslogWriter#closeWithTragicEvent. When invoking this method, the
inner close method could throw an exception which we always catch and
suppress into the exception that led us to tragically close. This commit
moves that repeated logic into closeWithTragicException and now callers
simply need to catch, invoke closeWithTragicException, and rethrow.
