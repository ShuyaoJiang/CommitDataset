[Rollup] Don't randomize index name in test

The test job helper randomizes the index name with 1-10 characters,
which can lead to randomized index names to overlap and show fewer
caps than the test expects.

The solution is to just use index names "0"-"24" to ensure none
of the names overlap, and thus the caps don't overlap.
