[ML] Preserve _meta on results index mapping update (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2274)

When mappings are updated for an index are updated most settings are
merged, but not _meta.  This change ensures that _meta is set when we
add per-job term mappings to our results index mappings.  In order to
keep the logic for updating mappings after upgrade working, we now
have to put ALL the mappings for our results along with the latest _meta
section when updating per-job term mappings.
