Prevent cluster internal `ClusterState.Custom` impls to leak to a client (#26232)

Today a `ClusterState.Custom` can be fetched by a transport client and
leaks to the user even if the classes are private etc since the serialized
bytes can be reconstructed. This change adds an option to customs to mark
them as private such that our clusterstate action will never leak it.
