[Zen2] Add warning if cluster fails to form fast enough (#35993)

* Add warning if cluster fails to form fast enough

Today if a leader is not discovered or elected then nodes are essentially
silent at INFO and above, and log copiously at DEBUG and below. A short delay
when electing a leader is not unusual, for instance if other nodes have not yet
started, but a persistent failure to elect a leader is a problem worthy of log
messages in the default configuration.

With this change, while there is no leader each node outputs a WARN-level log
message every 10 seconds (by default) indicating as such, describing the
current discovery state and the current quorum(s).

* Add note about whether the discovered nodes form a quorum or not

* Introduce separate ClusterFormationFailureHelper

... and back out the unnecessary changes elsewhere

* It can be volatile
