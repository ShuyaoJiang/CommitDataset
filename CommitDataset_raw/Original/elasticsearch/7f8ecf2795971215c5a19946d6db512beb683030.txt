Improve CcrRepositoryIT mappings tests (#38817)

Currently we index documents concurrently to attempt to ensure that we
update mappings during the restore process. However, this does not
actually test that the mapping will be correct and is dangerous as it
can lead to a misalignment between the max sequence number and the local
checkpoint. If these are not aligned, peer recovery cannot be completed
without initiating following which this test does not do. That causes
teardown assertions to fail.

This commit removes the concurrent indexing and flushes after the
documents are indexed. Additionally it modifies the mapping specific
test to ensure that there is a mapping update when the restore session
is initiated. This mapping update is picked up at the end of the restore
by the follower.
