Allow an AuthenticationResult to return metadata (#34382)

PR #34290 made it impossible to use thread-context values to pass
authentication metadata out of a realm. The SAML realm used this
technique to allow the SamlAuthenticateAction to process the parsed
SAML token, and apply them to the access token that was generated.

This new method adds metadata to the AuthenticationResult itself, and
then the authentication service makes this result available on the
thread context.
