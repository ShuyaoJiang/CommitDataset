Add a second refresh to concurrent relocation test

This commit adds a second refresh to the concurrent relocation
test. This is necessary as the first refresh might have brought back a
local checkpoint for a shard that a newly relocated primary became aware
of but did not yet receive a local checkpoint for that shard. When that
local checkpoint arrives on the new primary, the global checkpoint could
advance again and so we need a second replication action to push that
global checkpoint back out to the replica. This is indeed a hack, and it
will eventually be removed.

Closes #24599
