HLRC: Use nonblocking entity for requests (#32249)

Previously the HLRC used a blocking ByteArrayEntity, but the Request
class also allows to set a NByteArrayEntity, and defaults to nonblocking
when calling the createJsonEntity method. This commit cleans up all the
uses of ByteArrayEntity in the RequestConverters to use the nonblocking
entity.
