Organize soft_deletes settings into a single group

GetSettingsResponseTests fails on the ccr branch because it excludes the
root-level settings while we introduced "index.soft_deletes" - a
root-level setting in this branch.

This commit moves "index.soft_deletes" to the grouped-level settings.
Moreover, as we are going to introduce more settings for soft_deletes, I
think it's better to organize all these settings into a single group.
