[ML] Modify thresholds for normalization triggers (#33663)

[ML] Modify thresholds for normalization triggers

The (arbitrary) threshold factors used to judge if scores have
changed significantly enough to trigger a look-back renormalization have
been changed to values that reduce the frequency of such
renormalizations.

Added a clause to treat changes in scores as a 'big change' if it would
result in a change of severity reported in the UI.

Also altered the clause affecting small scores so that a change should
be considered big if scores have changed by at least 1.5.
