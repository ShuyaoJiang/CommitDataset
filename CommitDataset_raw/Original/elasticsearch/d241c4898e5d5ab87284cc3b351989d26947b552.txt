Removes parent child fielddata specialization (#24737)

This change removes the field data specialization needed for the parent field and replaces it with
a simple DocValuesIndexFieldData. The underlying global ordinals are retrieved via a new function called
IndexOrdinalsFieldData#getOrdinalMap.
The children aggregation is also modified to use a simple WithOrdinals value source rather than the deleted WithOrdinals.Parent.
