LLREST: Drop deprecated methods (#33223)

In #29623 we added `Request` object flavored requests to the low level
REST client and in #30315 we deprecated the old `performRequest`s. In a
long series of PRs I've changed all of the old style requests. This
drops the deprecated methods and will be released with 7.0.
