Logging: Use settings when building daemon threads (#32751)

Subclasses of `EsIntegTestCase` run multiple Elasticsearch nodes in the
same JVM and when we log we look at the name of the thread to figure out
the node name. This makes sure that all calls to `daemonThreadFactory`
include the node name.

Closes #32574

I'd like to follow this up with more drastic changes that make it
impossible to do this incorrectly but that change is much larger than
this and I'd like to get these log lines fixed up sooner rather than
later.
