SQL: Fix result column names for CAST (#33604)

Previously, when an non-pruned cast (casting as a different
data type) got applied on a table column in the `SELECT` clause,
the name of the result column didn't contain the target data type
of the cast, e.g.:

  SELECT CAST(MAX(salary) AS DOUBLE) FROM "test_emp"

returned as column name:

  CAST(MAX(salary))

instead of:

  CAST(MAX(salary) AS DOUBLE)

Closes #33571

* Added more tests for trivial casts that are pruned
