[Zen2] Introduce ClusterBootstrapService (#35488)

Today, the bootstrapping of a Zen2 cluster is driven externally, requiring
something else to wait for discovery to converge and then to inject the initial
configuration. This is hard to use in some situations, such as REST tests.

This change introduces the `ClusterBootstrapService` which brings the bootstrap
retry logic within each node and allows it to be controlled via an (unsafe)
node setting.
