TEST: Avoid merges in testRecoveryWithOutOfOrderDelete

Since LUCENE-8263, testRecoveryWithOutOfOrderDelete may trigger merges
because of the deletes. In the test, we try to retain index#0 but
reclaim delete#1. However, if a merge is triggered, we will remove both
index#0 and delete#1.

This commit disables merges in this test. Another option is to index
more documents in the segment_2 to reduce the deletion ratio.
