[Security] Handle non-existent user in native realm (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2044)

Since change elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch@f796949 authentication is not allowed to respond with null, it must be AuthenticationResult.notHandled()

- Fixes 1 case where the native realm would respond null if the user was not found
- Fixes some edge cases in the LDAP realm.
