Watcher: Fix watch history template for dynamic slack attachments (#30172)

The part of the history template responsible for slack attachments had a
dynamic mapping configured which could lead to problems, when a string
value looking like a date was configured in the value field of an
attachment.

This commit fixes the template by setting this field always to text.
This also requires a change in the template numbering to be sure this
will be applied properly when starting watcher.
