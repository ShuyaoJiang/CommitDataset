Merge tsa with ts (#26369)

We currently have a weird relationship between Transport,
TransportService, and TransportServiceAdaptor. At some point I think
that we would like to collapse these all into one concept as we only
support TCP transports.

This commit moves in that direction by eliminating the adaptor and just
passing the transport service to the transport.
