Docs: Remove s3 repository integ test documentation (#26005)

The s3 repository plugin has "third party" integ tests which rely
on external service and configuration setup. These tests are really
internal verification of the plugin (and should be moved to real integ
tests). Running them is not something a user should do, and the
documentation has been out of date for all of 5.x. This commit removes
the docs, removing potential confusion for users.
