XContentBuilder to handle BigInteger and BigDecimal (#32888)

Although we allow to index BigInteger and BigDecimal into a keyword
field, source filtering on these fields would fail
as XContentBuilder was not able to deserialize BigInteger and BigDecimal
to json.

This modifies XContentBuilder to allow to handle BigInteger and
BigDecimal.

Closes #32395
