Add support for filtering mappings fields (#27603)

Add support for filtering fields returned as part of mappings in get index, get mappings, get field mappings and field capabilities API.

Plugins can plug in their own function, which receives the index as argument, and return a predicate which controls whether each field is included or not in the returned output.
