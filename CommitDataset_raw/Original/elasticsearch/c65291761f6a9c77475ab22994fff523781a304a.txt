Add build utility to check cluster health over ssl (#40573)

By default, in integ tests we wait for the standalone cluster to start
by using the ant Get task to retrieve the cluster health endpoint.
However the ant task has no facilities for customising the trusted
CAs for a https resource, so if the integ test cluster has TLS enabled
on the http interface (using a custom CA) we need a separate utility
for that purpose.
