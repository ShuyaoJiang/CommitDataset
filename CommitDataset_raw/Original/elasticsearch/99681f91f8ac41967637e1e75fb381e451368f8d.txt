Use more precise does S3 bucket exist method (#34123)

We are using a deprecated method for checking if an S3 bucket
exists. This deprecated method has a limitation that it can not
distinguish between invalid credentials and a lack of permissions. This
commit switches to using a method that correctly surfaces if invalid
credentials are supplied when checking for the existence of a bucket.
