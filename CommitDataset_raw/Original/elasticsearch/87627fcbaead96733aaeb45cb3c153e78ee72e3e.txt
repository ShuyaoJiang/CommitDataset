Remove es.cluster_state.size hard failure (#40111)

In 6.7.0 we introduced a system property to return the old behavior of
computing and sending the compressed size of the cluster state on
cluster state endpoints. In 7.0.0, we removed this behavior but hard
failed usage of this system property (to clearly inform users this
behavior is gone). In this commit, intending to target 8.0.0 only, we
remove this detection as it should no longer be needed; that is, we now
treat this as dead code.
