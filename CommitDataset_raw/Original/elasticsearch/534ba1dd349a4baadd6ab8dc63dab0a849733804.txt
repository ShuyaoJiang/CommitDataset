Remove LicenseServiceClusterNotRecoveredTests (#37528)

While tests migration from Zen1 to Zen2, we've encountered this test.
This test is organized as follows:

Starts the first cluster node.
Starts the second cluster node.
Checks that license is active.
Interesting fact that adding assertLicenseActive(true) between 1
and 2 also makes the test pass.
assertLicenseActive retrieves XPackLicenseState from the nodes
and checks that active flag is set. It's set to true even before
the cluster is initialized.

So this test does not make sense.
