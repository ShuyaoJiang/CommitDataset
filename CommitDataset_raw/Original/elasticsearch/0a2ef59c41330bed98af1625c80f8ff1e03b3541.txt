Watcher: Fix check for currently executed watches (#31137)

The ack watch action has a check for currently executed watches, to make
sure that currently running watches cannot be acknowledged. This check
only checked on the coordinating node for watches being executed, but should
have checked the whole cluster using a WatcherStatsRequest, which is
being switched to in this commit.
