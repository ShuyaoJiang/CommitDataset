Move ingest-geoip default databases out of config (#36949)

Today the default databases bundled with ingest-geoip are treated as
configuration files that we unbundle into the Elasticsearch
configuration directory. This can cause problems for users using our
Docker images if they bind mount over the configuration
directory. Additionally, it creates complexity when trying to convert
ingest-geoip to a module. This commit moves these databases out of the
configuration directory and instead loads from the plugin
directory. Further, custom databases can still be put into the
configuration directory.
