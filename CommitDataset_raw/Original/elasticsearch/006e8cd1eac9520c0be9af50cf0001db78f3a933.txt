IndexingIT should check for global checkpoints regardless of master version

In the past global checkpoint syncing was done in the background based an interval set by an index setting. In order to set that setting something reasonable for a test, the master needed to know about the setting. Therefore the test didn't check global checkpoints if the master was old. These days the global checkpoint sync is inlined with indexing operations and that restriction is not needed.
