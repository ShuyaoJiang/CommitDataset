Remove vestiges of animal sniffer (#31178)

We no longer need animal sniffer because we use JDK functionality
(introduced in JDK 9) to target older versions of the JDK for
compilation. This functionality means that the JDK handles the problem
of ensuring that we do not use JDK APIs from the version that we are
compiling from that are not available in the version that we are
compiling to. A previous commit removed this for the REST client (where
we target JDK 7) but a few traces were left behind.
