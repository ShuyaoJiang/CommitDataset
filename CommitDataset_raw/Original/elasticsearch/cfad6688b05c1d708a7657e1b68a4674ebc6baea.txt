Migrate migration docs from 6.0 to 7.0 (#26227)

* Migrate migration docs from 6.0 to 7.0

Since we only keep one version of migration docs and master is now on 7.0, we
should migrate these so breaking changes can be added in the right place.

* Remove release notes as well

They link to the migration guides, so they have to go.

* Add placeholder notes for 7.0 so doc build is happy
