Add read timeouts to http module (#27713)

We currently do not have any server-side read timeouts implemented in
elasticsearch. This commit adds a read timeout setting that defaults to
30 seconds. If after 30 seconds a read has not occurred, the channel
will be closed. A timeout of value of 0 will disable the timeout.
