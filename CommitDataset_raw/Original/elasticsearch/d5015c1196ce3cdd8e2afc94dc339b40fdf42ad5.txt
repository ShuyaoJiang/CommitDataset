IntervalQueryBuilderTests#testNonIndexedFields test fix (#40418)

This test checks that interval queries constructed against a field with no indexed
positions will throw exceptions. It uses a randomly-build IntervalsSourceProvider
against a fixed set of fields; however, the random source builder can occasionally
provide a source with a fixed field, meaning that even if the top-level query asks
for a set of intervals over a non-indexed field, the source will delegate to another
field, and no exception will be thrown.

This commit changes the test to always use a simple Match provider.
