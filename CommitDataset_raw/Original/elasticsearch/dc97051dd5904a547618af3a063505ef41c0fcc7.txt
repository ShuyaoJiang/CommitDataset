Make various LifecycleSettings Settings internal (#32381)

These are only ever set internally during regular ILM execution, they don't need
to be set otherwise.

A subsequent PR will work on adding a dedicated endpoint for the
`LIFECYCLE_NAME` setting so it can be changed by a user (and then marked as
`InternalIndex` as well)

Relates to #29823
