Update allocation awareness docs (#29116)

Update allocation awareness docs

Today, the docs imply that if multiple attributes are specified the the
whole combination of values is considered as a single entity when
performing allocation. In fact, each attribute is considered separately. This
change fixes this discrepancy.

It also replaces the use of the term "awareness zone" with "zone or domain", and
reformats some paragraphs to the right width.

Fixes #29105
