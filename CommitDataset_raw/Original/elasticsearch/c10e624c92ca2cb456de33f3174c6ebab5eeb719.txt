update RolloverAction to utilize an index-setting for rollover_alias (#30158)

The purpose of this change is to reflect what is the future way of configuring aliases in
the Rollover action for ILM. With this change, users will be able to edit all desired rollover-related
information in the index's template, so that the index-lifecycle policy does not need to be dependent on it.
