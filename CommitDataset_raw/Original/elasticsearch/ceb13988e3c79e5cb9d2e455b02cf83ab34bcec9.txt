Watcher: Do not update watch status state during execution (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2204)

When a watch is executed, it sends an update request to the watch to
udpate its status.

This update request also updates the status.state field, which contains
information, if the watch is active. If the watch gets executed, and
during execution a watch gets disabled, then the current execution will
set the watch back to active.

This commit fixes the current behaviour and never changes the state of
a watch when updating the status after executing, allowing
activate/deactivate calls to work as expected, regardless if a watch
is being executed.

This will fix not only the current behaviour but also some flaky tests.
