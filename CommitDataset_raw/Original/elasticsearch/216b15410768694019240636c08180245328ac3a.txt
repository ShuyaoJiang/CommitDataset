Replace 0L with an UNASSIGNED_PRIMARY_TERM constant (#36819)

* Replace 0L with an UNASSIGNED_PRIMARY_TERM constant

0 is an illegal value for a primary term that is often used to indicate
the primary term isn't assigned or is irrelevant. This PR replaces the
usage of 0 with a constant, to improve readability and so it can be
tracked and if needed, replaced.
