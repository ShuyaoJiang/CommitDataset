Replace PhaseAfterStep with PhaseCompleteStep (#33398)

This removes `PhaseAfterStep` in favor of a new `PhaseCompleteStep`. This step
in only a marker that the `LifecyclePolicyRunner` needs to halt until the time
indicated for entering the next phase.

This also fixes a bug where phase times were encapsulated into the policy
instead of dynamically adjusting to policy changes.

Supersedes #33140, which it replaces
Relates to #29823
