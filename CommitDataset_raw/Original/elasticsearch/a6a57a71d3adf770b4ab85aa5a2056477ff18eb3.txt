Implement socket and server ChannelContexts (#28275)

This commit is related to #27260. Currently have a channel context that
implements reading and writing logic for socket channels. Additionally,
we have exception contexts to handle exceptions. And accepting contexts
to handle accepted channels. This PR introduces a ChannelContext that
handles close and exception handling for all channel types.
Additionally, it has implementers that provide specific functionality
for socket channels (read and writing). And specific functionality for
server channels (accepting).
