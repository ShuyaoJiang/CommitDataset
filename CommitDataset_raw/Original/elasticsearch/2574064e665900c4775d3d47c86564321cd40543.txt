Enable rest tests via IDEs (#29439)

Currently rest-based tests do not work from the IDE, as the security
manager is configured to permit certain network operations when
using the snapshot jars compiled by gradle.  We have an existing
workaround that explicitly associates a codebase with the path
from which the classes are loaded (in this case, the IDE build
directory).  This PR adds the rest client to this workaround list.
