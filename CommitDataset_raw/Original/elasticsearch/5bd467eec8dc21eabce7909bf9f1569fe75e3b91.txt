[ML] Respect max_result_window setting in result APIs (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4380)

Currently there is a hardcoded check against 10000, which
is the default value of the max_result_window setting. This
is a relic of the past. Removing this hardcoded validation
means we respect the setting so that a user may alter it
when appropriate.
