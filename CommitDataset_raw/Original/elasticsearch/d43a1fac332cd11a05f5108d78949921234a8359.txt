Lock down Engine.Searcher (#34363)

`Engine.Searcher` is non-final today which makes it error prone
in the case of wrapping the underlying reader or lucene `IndexSearcher`
like we do in `IndexSearcherWrapper`. Yet, there is no subclass of it yet
that would be dramatic to just drop on the floor. With the start of development
of frozen indices this changed since in #34357 functionality was added to
a subclass which would be dropped if a `IndexSearcherWrapper` is installed on an index.
This change locks down the `Engine.Searcher` to prevent such a functionality trap.
