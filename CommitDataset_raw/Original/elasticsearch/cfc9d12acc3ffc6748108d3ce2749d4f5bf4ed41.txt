[TEST] test against scaled value instead of fixed epsilon in MovAvgIT

When comparing doubles, fixed epsilons can fail because the absolute
difference in values may be quite large, even though the relative
difference is tiny (e.g. with two very large numbers).

Instead, we can scale epsilon by the absolute value of the expected
value.  This means we are looking for a diff that is epsilon-percent
away from the value, rather than just epsilon.

This is basically checking the relative error using junit's assertEqual.

Closes #29456, unmutes the test
