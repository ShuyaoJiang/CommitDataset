SearchWhileCreatingIndexIT: remove usage of _only_nodes

the only nodes preference was used as a replacement of `_primary` which was removed. Sadly, it's not the same as we also check that it makes sense - i.e., that the given node has a shard copy. Since the test uses indices with >1 shards, the primaries may be spread to multiple nodes. Using one (like it currently does) will fail for some primaries. Using all will probably end up hitting all nodes.

This commit removed the `_only_nodes` usage in favor a simple search

Relates to #26791
