[TEST] Stabilise UpdateInterimResultsIT

Depending on the random numbers fed to the analytics,
it is possible that the first planted anomaly ends up
in a different bucket due to the overlapping buckets feature.
Then that may result to a single interim bucket being available
due to overlapping buckets blocking the other interim bucket
from being considered.

I am removing the initial anomaly from the test as it is not useful
and it makes the test unstable.
