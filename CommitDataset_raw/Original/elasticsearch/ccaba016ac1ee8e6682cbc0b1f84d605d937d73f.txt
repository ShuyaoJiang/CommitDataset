Fix task ordering in rolling upgrade tests

The configuration of the upgraded cluster task was missing a dependency
on the stopping of the second old node in the cluster. In some cases
(e.g., --parallel) Gradle would then try to run the configuration of a
node in the upgraded cluster before it had even configured the old nodes
in the cluster.
