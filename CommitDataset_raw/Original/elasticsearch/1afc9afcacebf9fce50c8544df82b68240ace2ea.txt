Version option should display if snapshot

We have a command-line flag -V or --version that can be used to display
the version of Elasticsearch. However, the version that we display does
not contain whether or not the version is a snapshot build. This commit
changes the behavior here so that if the build is a snapshot, that is
included in the version string.
