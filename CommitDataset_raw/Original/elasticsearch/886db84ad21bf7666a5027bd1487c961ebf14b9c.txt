Expose Lucene's FeatureField. (#30618)

Lucene has a new `FeatureField` which gives the ability to record numeric
features as term frequencies. Its main benefit is that it allows to boost
queries with the values of these features and efficiently skip non-competitive
documents at the same time using block-max WAND and indexed impacts.
