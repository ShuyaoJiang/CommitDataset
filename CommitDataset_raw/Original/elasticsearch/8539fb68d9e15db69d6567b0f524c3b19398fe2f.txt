Test: Revert pinning MockWebServer to TLSv1.2 (#34148)

Revert "[TESTS] Pin MockWebServer to TLS1.2 (#33127)" (commit
214652d4af8188d4ba872626eeea3bcdff7096f0) and "Pin TLS1.2 in
SSLConfigurationReloaderTests" (commit
d9f5e4fd2e06c9b69f3b4744e49e747e1ff708b4), which pinned the
MockWebServer used in the SSLConfigurationReloaderTests to TLSv1.2 in
order to prevent failures with JDK 11 related to ssl session
invalidation. We no longer need this pinning as the problematic code
was fixed in #34130.
