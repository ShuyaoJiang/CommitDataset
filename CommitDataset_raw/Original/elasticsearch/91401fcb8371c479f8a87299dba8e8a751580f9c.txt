[Monitoring] Add "collection_enabled" to usage (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4128)

This adds an indicator to Monitoring's portion of X-Pack usage whether or
not collection is actually enabled. It's no longer enough to have an
exporter defined by default to know if monitoring is actually running.
