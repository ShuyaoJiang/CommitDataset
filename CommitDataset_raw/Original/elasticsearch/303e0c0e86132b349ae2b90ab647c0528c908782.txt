Fix `ShardSplittingQuery` to respect nested documents. (#27398)

Today if nested docs are used in an index that is split the operation
will only work correctly if the index is not routing partitioned or
unless routing is used. This change fixes the query that selectes the docs
to delete to also select all parents nested docs as well.
