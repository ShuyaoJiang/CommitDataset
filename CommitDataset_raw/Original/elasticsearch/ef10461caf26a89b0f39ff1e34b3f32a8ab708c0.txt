[TEST] Instead of ignoring the ccr downgrade to basic license qa test
avoid the assertions that check the log files, because that does not work on Windows.
The rest of the test is still useful and should work on Windows CI.

Currently on Windows CI this qa module fails because there is just one test and
that test si ignored if OS is Windows.
