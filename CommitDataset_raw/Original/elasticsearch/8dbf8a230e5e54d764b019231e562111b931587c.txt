Build: Add back explicit exclusions and remove gradle exclusions (#24879)

When transitive dependencies are disable for a dependency, gradle adds a
wildcard exclusion to the generated pom. However, some external tools
like ivy have bugs with wildcards. This commit adds back the explicit
generation of transitive excludes, and removes the gradle generated
exclusions element from the pom.

closes #24490
