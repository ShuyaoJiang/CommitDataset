Watcher: Only trigger a watch if new or schedule/changed (#35908)

The trigger engine did always create a new schedule data structure, when
the watcher indexing listener called an add. However the indexing
listener also called add, when the watch status was updated. This means,
that upon a watch status update the watch got retriggered, potentially
waiting a defined interval from the watch status update onwards, instead
of waiting from the last run.

This commit only updates the schedule in the trigger engine, if it
actually has changed, otherwise the existing schedule will not be
touched. This has two results

1. If a watch is updated by an execution, the existing interval will not
be touched (meaning the scheduled time will not move forward).
2. If a watch is updated by a user, but the schedule is not changed, it
will not be reset from the update (for example starting to count from 5
minutes again, if the interval was set to 5 minutes).

Furthermore some minor cleanups were applied, making variables final in
the ctor, preventing double creation of variables.
