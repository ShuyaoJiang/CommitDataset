Update SSLDriver for JDK 11 changes (#34398)

JDK11 introduced some changes with the SSLEngine. A number of error
messages were changed. Additionally, there were some behavior changes
in regard to how the SSLEngine handles closes during the handshake
process. This commit updates our tests and SSLDriver to support these
changes.
