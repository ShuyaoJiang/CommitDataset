Security: switch to IllegalArgumentException if request cannot be serialized

The commit switches the CreateTokenRequest and InvalidateTokenRequest to throw an
IllegalArgumentException when the version the request is being serialized to does not support the
request. This fixes test failures due to the use of the AssertingTransportInterceptor testing
serialization with versions prior to 6.2. The IAE is an indication to the
AssertingTranpsortInterceptor that the request does not support the version.
