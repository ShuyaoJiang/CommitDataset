Add TLS/SSL enabled SecurityNioTransport (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3519)

This is related to elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3246. This commit adds a SSL/TLS layer to the nio
work implemented in the SSLChannelContext and SSLDriver classes.
This work is used to build up a SecurityNioTransport implementation.
This transport does yet offer feature parity with our normal security
transport. It mainly offers SSL/TLS security.
