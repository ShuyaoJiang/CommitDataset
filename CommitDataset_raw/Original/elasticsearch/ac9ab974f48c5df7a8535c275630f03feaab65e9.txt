Ensure token service can boostrap itself without a pre-shared key (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2240)

Today we require a pre-shared key to use the token service. Beside the
additional setup step it doesn't allow for key-rotation which is a major downside.

This change adds a TokenService private ClusterState.Custom that is used to distribute
the keys used to encrypt tokens. It also has the infrastructur to add automatic key
rotation which is not in use yet but included here to illustrate how it can work down
the road.

This is considered a prototype and requires additioanl integration testing. Yet, it's fully
BWC with a rolling / full cluster restart from a previous version (also from 5.6 to 6.x)
since if the password is set it will just use it instead of generating a new one.
Once we implement the automatic key rotation via the clusterstate we need to ensure that we are
fully upgraded before we do that.
Also note that the ClusterState.Custom is fully transient and will never be serialized to disk.
