Deprecate types in get, exists, and multi get. (#35930)

For each API, the following updates were made:
- Add deprecation warnings to `Rest*Action`, plus tests in `Rest*ActionTests`.
- For each REST yml test, make sure there is one version without types, and another legacy version that retains types (called *_with_types.yml).
- Deprecate relevant methods on the Java HLRC requests/ responses.
- Update documentation (for both the REST API and Java HLRC).
