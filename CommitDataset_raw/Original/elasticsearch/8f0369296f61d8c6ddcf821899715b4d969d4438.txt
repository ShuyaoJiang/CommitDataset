Prohibit using `nested_filter`, `nested_path` and new `nested` Option at the same time in FieldSortBuilder (#26490)

Currently we allow both "old" and "new" way of setting nested sorts on the
FieldSortBuilder at the same time. This should throw an error, instead the user
should choose one of the two possible options.

Also adding testing for the now deprecated nestedPath/nestedFilter parameters,
inlcuding checks that they emmit warnings on parsing and that the new
NestetedSortBuilder overwrites the deprecated parameters when building the
SortField.
