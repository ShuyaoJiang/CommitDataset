Fix elasticsearch-cli dependency

The API JAR POM picks up the wrong artifact name for the :core:cli
dependency, using the project name instead of the archive base
name. This commit fixes this issue by explicitly referring to the
artifact as a runtime dependency. With this change, the correct artifact
name is used in the API JAR POM.
