Watcher: Validate email adresses when storing a watch (#34042)

Right now, watches fail on runtime, when invalid email addresses are
used.

All those fields can be checked on parsing, if no mustache is used in
any email address template. In that case we can return immediate
feedback, that invalid email addresses should not be specified when
trying to store a watch.
