Remove all dependencies from XContentBuilder (#29225)

* Remove all dependencies from XContentBuilder

This commit removes all of the non-JDK dependencies from XContentBuilder, with
the exception of `CollectionUtils.ensureNoSelfReferences`. It adds a third
extension point around dealing with time-based fields and formatters to work
around the Joda dependency.

This decoupling allows us to be able to move XContentBuilder to a separate lib
so it can be available for things like the high level rest client.
