Turn off real-mem breaker in REST tests

With this commit we disable the real-memory circuit breaker in REST
tests as this breaker is based on real memory usage over which we have
no (full) control in tests and the REST client is not yet ready to retry
on circuit breaker exceptions.

This is only meant as a temporary measure to avoid spurious test
failures while we ensure that the REST client can handle those
situations appropriately.
