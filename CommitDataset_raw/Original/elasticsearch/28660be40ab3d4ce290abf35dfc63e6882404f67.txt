Fix resync request serialization

This commit addresses a subtle bug in the serialization routine for
resync requests. The problem here is that Translog.Operation#readType is
not compatible with the implementations of
Translog.Operation#writeTo. Unfortunately, this issue prevents
primary-replica from succeeding, issues which we will address in
follow-ups.
