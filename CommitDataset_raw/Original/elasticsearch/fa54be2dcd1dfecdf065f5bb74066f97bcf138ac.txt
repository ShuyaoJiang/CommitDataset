CCR: Do not minimization requesting range on leader (#30980)

Today before reading operations on the leading shard, we minimization
the requesting range with the global checkpoint. However, this might
make the request invalid if the following shard generates a requesting
range based on the global-checkpoint from a primary shard and sends 
that request to a replica whose global checkpoint is lagged.

Another issue is that we are mutating the request when applying
minimization. If the request becomes invalid on a replica, we will
reroute the mutated request instead of the original one to the primary.

This commit removes the minimization and replaces it by a range check
with the local checkpoint.
