[ML] Add Detector config classes to protocol library (#32495)

This commit adds the Detector class and its dependencies to the
X-Pack protocol library used by the high level REST client.

(Future commits will add the remaining config classes, plus results
and stats classes.)

These classes:

- Are immutable, with builders, but the builders do no validation
  beyond null checks
- Are convertible to and from X-Content, but NOT wire transportable
- Have lenient parsers to maximize compatibility across versions
- Have the same class names, member names and getter/setter names
  as the corresponding classes in X-Pack core to ease migration
  for transport client users
- Don't reproduce all the methods that do calculations or
  transformations that the the corresponding classes in X-Pack core
  have
