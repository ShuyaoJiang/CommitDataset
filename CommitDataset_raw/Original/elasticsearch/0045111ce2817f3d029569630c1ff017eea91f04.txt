Deprecate the suggest metrics (#29627)

The suggest stats were folded into the search stats as part of the
indices stats API in 5.0.0. However, the suggest metric remained as a
synonym for the search metric for BWC reasons. This commit deprecates
usage of the suggest metric on the indices stats API.

Similarly, due to the changes to fold the suggest stats into the search
stats, requesting the suggest index metric on the indices metric on the
nodes stats API has produced an empty object as the response since
5.0.0. This commit deprecates this index metric on the indices metric on
the nodes stats API.
