Introduce plugin-specific env scripts

With plugins of a meta-plugin now loaded in separate classloaders, we
should not be loading all classes in all plugins of a meta-plugin when
executing scripts. This is particularly problematic in the case of
security extensions where the install plugin extension command would be
running with the classpath of all plugins. However, if there is JAR hell
in this classpath, installation would fail. This is not realistic though
since the plugins are run in separate classloaders. To fix this, for the
scripts of a plugin, we only set the classpath to include the JARs for
that plugin and the JARs of core. This leads us to the introduction of
plugin-specific env scripts.
