Remove token passphrase setting (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2318)

This change removes `xpack.security.authc.token.passphrase` entirely since from
6.0 onwards we use randomly generated keys by the master there is no need for
this setting anymore. This setting will be deprecated from 6.0 onwards.
