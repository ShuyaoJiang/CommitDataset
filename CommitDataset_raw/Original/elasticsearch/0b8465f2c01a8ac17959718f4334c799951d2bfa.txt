Update type to "seat" (#35086)

otherwise this throws an exception: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Rejecting mapping update to [seats] as the final mapping would have more than 1 type: [seat, _doc]

May be, later for the types removal, we can modify `seats.json` to have a type `_doc` instead of `seat`
