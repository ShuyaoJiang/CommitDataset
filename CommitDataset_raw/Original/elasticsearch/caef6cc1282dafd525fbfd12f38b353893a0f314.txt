[TEST] Move version skip to setup in Indices.GetMapping#70_legacy_multi_type (#25816)

Since the setup attempts to create an index with two types, and the setup runs before any test,
this will fail on versions 6.0+ before it has a chance to check the skip in each individual
test.  Moving to the setup resolves this issue.
