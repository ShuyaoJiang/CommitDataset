Add notion of internal index settings (#31286)

We have some use cases for an index setting to only be manageable by
dedicated APIs rather than be updateable via the update settings
API. This commit adds the notion of an internal index setting. Such
settings can be set on create index requests, they can not be changed
via the update settings API, yet they can be changed by action on behalf
of or triggered by the user via dedicated APIs.
