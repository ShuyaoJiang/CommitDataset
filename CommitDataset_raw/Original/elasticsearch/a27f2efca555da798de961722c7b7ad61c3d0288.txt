Core: Converge FormatDateTimeFormatter and DateFormatter apis (#36390)

This commit makes FormatDateTimeFormatter and DateFormatter apis close
to each other, so that the former can be removed in favor of the latter.
This PR does not change the uses of FormatDateTimeFormatter yet, so that
that future change can be purely mechanical.
