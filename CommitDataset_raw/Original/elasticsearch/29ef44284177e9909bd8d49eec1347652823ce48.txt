Add a `_freeze` / `_unfreeze` API (#35592)

This commit adds a rest endpoint for freezing and unfreezing an index.
Among other cleanups mainly fixing an issue accessing package private APIs
from a plugin that got caught by integration tests this change also adds
documentation for frozen indices.
Note: frozen indices are marked as `beta` and available as a basic feature.
