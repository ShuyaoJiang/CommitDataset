HTML5ify Javadoc for core and test framework (#30234)

`javadoc` will switch from detaulting to html4 to html5 in "a future
release". We should get ahead of it so we're not surprised. Also, HTML5
is the future! Er, the present. Anyway, this follows up from #30220 to
make the Javadoc for two of the four remaining projects HTML5
compatible.
