Core: Remove plain execute method on TransportAction (#30998)

TransportAction has many variants of execute. One of those variants
executes by returning a future, which is then often blocked on by
calling get(). This commit removes this variant of execute, instead
using a helper method for tests that want to block, or having tests
pass in a PlainActionFuture directly as a listener.
