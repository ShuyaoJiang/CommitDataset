Skip Rollover step if next index already exists (#35168)

If the Rollover step would fail due to the next index in sequence
already existing, just skip to the next step instead of going to the
Error step.

This prevents spurious `ResourceAlreadyExistsException`s created by
simultaneous RolloverStep executions from causing ILM to error out
unnecessarily.
