CCR: Add TransportService closed to retryable errors (#34722)

Both testFollowIndexAndCloseNode and testFailOverOnFollower failed
because they responded to the FollowTask a TransportService closed
exception which is currently considered as a fatal error. This behavior
is not desirable since a closing node can throw that exception, and we
should retry in that case.

This change adds TransportService closed error to the list of retryable
errors.

Closes #34694
