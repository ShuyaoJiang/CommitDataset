[Tests] Use mock storage in repository-gcs unit tests (#29397)

The repository-gcs unit tests rely on the GoogleCloudStorageTestServer
but it would be better if they rely on a mocked Storage client instead.

That would also help to extract the GoogleCloudStorageFixture and the
GoogleCloudStorageTestServer classes in a QA third party project.

Closes #28960
