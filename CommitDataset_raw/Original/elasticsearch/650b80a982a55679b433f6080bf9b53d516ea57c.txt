Reflect renaming of bulk thread pool (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4414)

The bulk thread pool was renamed to the write thread pool. This commit
adds support for this in X-Pack. Specifically, a change is needed in
monitoring to reflect the name change (and support the possibility that
the user has the display name for the write thread pool as "bulk").
