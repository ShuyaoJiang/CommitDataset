Reformat some classes in the index universe

This commit reformats some classes in the index universe with the
purpose of breaking some long method definitions and invocations into a
line per parameter. This has the advantage that for an upcoming change
to these definitions and invocations, the diff for that change will be a
single line per definition or invocation. That makes these sorts of
changes easier to read.
