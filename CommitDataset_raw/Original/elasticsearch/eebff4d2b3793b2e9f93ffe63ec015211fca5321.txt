Use non deprecated xcontenthelper (#28503)

* Move to non-deprecated XContentHelper.createParser(...)

This moves away from one of the now-deprecated XContentHelper.createParser
methods in favor of specifying the deprecation logger at parser creation time.

Relates to #28449

Note that this doesn't move all the `createParser` calls because some of them
use the already-deprecated method that doesn't specify the XContentType.

* Remove the deprecated (and now non-needed) createParser method
