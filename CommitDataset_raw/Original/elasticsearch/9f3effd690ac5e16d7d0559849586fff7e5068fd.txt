Watcher: Ignore system locale/timezone in croneval CLI tool (#33215)

The elasticsearch-croneval CLI tool uses local dates to display when
something gets triggered the next time. This is very confusing.

This commit ensures, that UTC and local timezone times will be written
out.

The output looks like this and contains localized dates for each trigger
date as well as for `now`.

Now is [Tue, 28 Aug 2018 17:23:51 +0000] in UTC, local time is [ᏔᎵᏁ, 28 ᎦᎶ 2018 12:23:51 -0500]
Here are the next 10 times this cron expression will trigger:
1.	Mon, 2 Jan 2040 11:00:00 +0000
	ᏉᏅᎯ, 2 ᎤᏃ 2040 06:00:00 -0500
2.      ...

This also removes an old outstanding TODO to use the jopt parsing to
cast the count to an integer instead of doing it ourselves.
