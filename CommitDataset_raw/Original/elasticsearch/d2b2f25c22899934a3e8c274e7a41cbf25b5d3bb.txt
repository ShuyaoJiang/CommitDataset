Bat scripts to work with JAVA_HOME with parentheses (#39712)

the elasticsearch.bat and elasticsearch-env.bat won't work if JAVA
contains parentheses. This seems to be the limitation of FOR /F IN
(command) DO syntax.
The JAVA variable present in a command contains a path to a binary to
start elasticsearch (with spaces & parens). We can workaround the
problem of spaces and parentheses in this path by referring this
variable with a CALL command.
Note that executing binaries with CALL is an undocumented behaviour (but works)
