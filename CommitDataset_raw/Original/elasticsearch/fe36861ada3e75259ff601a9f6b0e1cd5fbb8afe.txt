Add support for API keys to access Elasticsearch (#38291)

X-Pack security supports built-in authentication service
`token-service` that allows access tokens to be used to 
access Elasticsearch without using Basic authentication.
The tokens are generated by `token-service` based on
OAuth2 spec. The access token is a short-lived token
(defaults to 20m) and refresh token with a lifetime of 24 hours,
making them unsuitable for long-lived or recurring tasks where
the system might go offline thereby failing refresh of tokens.

This commit introduces a built-in authentication service
`api-key-service` that adds support for long-lived tokens aka API
keys to access Elasticsearch. The `api-key-service` is consulted
after `token-service` in the authentication chain. By default,
if TLS is enabled then `api-key-service` is also enabled.
The service can be disabled using the configuration setting.

The API keys:-
- by default do not have an expiration but expiration can be
  configured where the API keys need to be expired after a
  certain amount of time.
- when generated will keep authentication information of the user that
   generated them.
- can be defined with a role describing the privileges for accessing
   Elasticsearch and will be limited by the role of the user that
   generated them
- can be invalidated via invalidation API
- information can be retrieved via a get API
- that have been expired or invalidated will be retained for 1 week
  before being deleted. The expired API keys remover task handles this.

Following are the API key management APIs:-
1. Create API Key - `PUT/POST /_security/api_key`
2. Get API key(s) - `GET /_security/api_key`
3. Invalidate API Key(s) `DELETE /_security/api_key`

The API keys can be used to access Elasticsearch using `Authorization`
header, where the auth scheme is `ApiKey` and the credentials, is the 
base64 encoding of API key Id and API key separated by a colon.
Example:-
```
curl -H "Authorization: ApiKey YXBpLWtleS1pZDphcGkta2V5" http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health
```
