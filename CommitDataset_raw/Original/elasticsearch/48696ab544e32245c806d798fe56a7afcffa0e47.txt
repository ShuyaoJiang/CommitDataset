expose simple pattern tokenizers (#25159)

Expose the experimental simplepattern and 
simplepatternsplit tokenizers in the common 
analysis plugin. They provide tokenization based 
on regular expressions, using Lucene's 
deterministic regex implementation that is usually 
faster than Java's and has protections against 
creating too-deep stacks during matching.

Both have a not-very-useful default pattern of the 
empty string because all tokenizer factories must 
be able to be instantiated at index creation time. 
They should always be configured by the user 
in practice.
