Add versioned DataInput and DataOutput to SQL (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2600)

These wrap `DataInput` and `DataOutput` to add the protocol
version being serialized. This is similar to the mechanism
used by core and it has made adding and removing fields from
the serialization protocol fairly simple.
