Do not ignore shard not-available exceptions in replication (#28571)

The shard not-available exceptions are currently ignored in the
replication as the best effort avoids failing not-yet-ready shards.
However these exceptions can also happen from fully active shards. If
this is the case, we may have skipped important failures from replicas.
Since #28049, only fully initialized shards are received write requests.
This restriction allows us to handle all exceptions in the replication.

There is a side-effect with this change. If a replica retries its peer
recovery second time after being tracked in the replication group, it
can receive replication requests even though it's not-yet-ready. That
shard may be failed and allocated to another node even though it has a
good lucene index on that node.

This PR does not change the way we report replication errors to users,
hence the shard not-available exceptions won't be reported as before.
