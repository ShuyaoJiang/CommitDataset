[TEST] Fix error if named pipe already connected (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2423)

On Windows a named pipe server must call ConnectNamedPipe() before using
a named pipe.  However, if the client has already connected then this
function returns a failure code, with detailed error code
ERROR_PIPE_CONNECTED.  The server must check for this, as it means the
connection will work fine.  The Java test that emulates what the C++
would do in production did not have this logic.

This was purely a test problem.  The C++ code used in production already
does the right thing.
