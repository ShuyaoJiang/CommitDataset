Painless: Rename *Binding classes to *ClassBinding. (#33865)

With the upcoming instance bindings, the singular *Binding name isn't descriptive enough 
with multiple binding types. This renames the existing *Binding classes to *ClassBinding. 
Mechanical change (with some error messages changed from binding to class binding by 
hand).
