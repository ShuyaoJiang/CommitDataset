Let primary own its replication group (#25692)

Currently replication and recovery are both coordinated through the latest cluster state available on the ClusterService as well as through the GlobalCheckpointTracker (to have consistent local/global checkpoint information), making it difficult to understand the relation between recovery and replication, and requiring some tricky checks in the recovery code to coordinate between the two. This commit makes the primary the single owner of its replication group, which simplifies the replication model and allows to clean up corner cases we have in our recovery code. It also reduces the dependencies in the code, so that neither RecoverySourceXXX nor ReplicationOperation need access to the latest state on ClusterService anymore. Finally, it gives us the property that in-sync shard copies won't receive global checkpoint updates which are above their local checkpoint (relates #25485).
