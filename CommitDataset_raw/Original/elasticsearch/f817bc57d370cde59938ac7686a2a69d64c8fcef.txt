[Security] Multi Index Expression alias wildcard exclusion (#34144)

The Security plugin authorizes actions on indices. Authorization
happens on a per index/alias basis. Therefore a request with a
Multi Index Expression (containing wildcards) has to be
first evaluated in the authorization layer, before the request is
handled. For authorization purposes, wildcards in expressions will
only be expanded to indices/aliases that are visible by the authenticated
user. However, this "constrained" evaluation has to be compatible with
the expression evaluation that a cluster without the Security plugin
would do. Therefore any change in the evaluation logic
in any of these sites has to be mirrored in the other site.

This commit mirrors the changes in core from #33518 that allowed
for Multi Index Expression in the Get Alias API, loosely speaking.
