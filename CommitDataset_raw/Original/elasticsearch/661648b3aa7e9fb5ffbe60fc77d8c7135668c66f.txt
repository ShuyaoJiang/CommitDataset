Build: Allow build to configure which license/notice to embed in jars (#26373)

We currently add the apache license/notice for elasticsearch to any
plugin that uses our ES plugin gradle plugin. However, each plugin
should be able to use their own license. This commit adds a licenseFile
and noticeFile property to the root of project's using BuildPlugin,
which is added to jar files for that project.
