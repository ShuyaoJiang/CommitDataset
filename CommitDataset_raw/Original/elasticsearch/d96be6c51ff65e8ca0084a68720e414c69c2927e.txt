[ML] Only clear scroll whan a scroll id exists (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3148)

The issue here is that if the first search request fails
(initScroll), then we do not have a scroll_id. However,
in order to retry the search, we reset the scroll. That
involves clearing the current search, but since we do
not have a scroll_id, the clear scroll request fails.
We end up reporting the failure for the scroll clearing,
rather than the actual problem.

This commit fixes that by avoiding clearing the scroll
when the scroll_id is null.
