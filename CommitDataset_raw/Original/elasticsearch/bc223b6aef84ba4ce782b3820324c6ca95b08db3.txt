Removes completed snapshot from cluster state on master change (#24605)

Previously, if a master node updated the cluster state to reflect that a
snapshot is completed, but subsequently failed before processing a
cluster state to remove the snapshot from the cluster state, then the
newly elected master would not know that it needed to clean up the
leftover cluster state.

This commit ensures that the newly elected master sees if there is a
snapshot in the cluster state that is in the completed state but has not
yet been removed from the cluster state.

Closes #24452
