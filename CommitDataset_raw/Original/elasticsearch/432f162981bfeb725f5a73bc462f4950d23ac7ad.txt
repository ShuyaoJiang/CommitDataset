Build: Quiet bwc build output (#26430)

The output when building bwc versions is currently verbose, with git
warnings from doing git checkout of a hash. This commit changes this to
print the useful info before and after checking out. Note that due to
using LoggedExec, if the git task exits non-zero, the entire output will
still be dumped.
