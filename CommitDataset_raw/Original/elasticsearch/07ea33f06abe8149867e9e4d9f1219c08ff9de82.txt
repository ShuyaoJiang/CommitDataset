Fix occasional SearchServiceTests failure (#39697)

Currently SearchServiceTests.testCloseSearchContextOnRewriteException can fail
if a refresh happens while we test for the SearchPhaseExecutionException that is
thrown later in the test. The test takes the current Store#refCount and expects
it to be the same after the exception is thrown. If a refresh happens in that
interval however, the refCound will be different, causing the test to fail. This
can be provoked e.g. by running this section in a tight loop.
Switching of refresh for this tests solves the issue.
