Ensure that max seq # is equal to the global checkpoint when creating ReadOnlyEngines (#37426)

Since version 6.7.0 the Close Index API guarantees that all translog 
operations have been correctly flushed before the index is closed. If 
the index is reopened as a Frozen index (which uses a ReadOnlyEngine) 
we can verify that the maximum sequence number from the last Lucene 
commit is indeed equal to the last known global checkpoint and refuses 
to open the read only engine if it's not the case. In this PR the check is 
only done for indices created on or after 6.7.0 as they are guaranteed 
to be closed using the new Close Index API.
