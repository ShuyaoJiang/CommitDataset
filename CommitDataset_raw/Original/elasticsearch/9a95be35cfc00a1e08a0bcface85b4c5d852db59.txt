[Tests] Extract the testing logic for Google Cloud Storage (#28576)

This pull request extracts in a dedicated class the request/response 
logic that "emulates" a Google Cloud Storage service in our 
repository-gcs tests.

The idea behind this is to make the logic more reusable. The class 
MockHttpTransport has been renamed to MockStorage which now 
only takes care of instantiating a Storage client and does the low-level 
request/response plumbing needed by this client.

The "Google Cloud Storage" logic has been extracted from 
MockHttpTransport and put in a new GoogleCloudStorageTestServer 
that is now independent from the google client testing framework.
