Watcher: Hide credentials/secret data of integrations in toXContent (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4162)

If a user specifies an 'Authorization' header in an HTTPRequest we,
which might be needed instead of using HTTP Basic Auth due to using
Bearer Authentication, then in case of an failure, the request gets
logged including that Authorization header.

In addition, each implementation of a sent message for jira/hipchat/slack filters
out special fields when a HTTP request is written in case of a failed
response in order to not leak secret data.
