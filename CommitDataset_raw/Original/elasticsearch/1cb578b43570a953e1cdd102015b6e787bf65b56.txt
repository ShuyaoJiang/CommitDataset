[DOCS] Update sysctl instructions for Docker on Mac (#35755)

Recent Docker for Mac releases[1] have a different path to the tty for
accessing the console of the xhyve vm, required for altering the
`vm.max_map_count` sysctl.

Update instructions on how to enter the xhyve vm for altering the
`vm.max_map_count` sysctl setting on Docker for Mac.

Closes #34817
