[Test] Wait for no relocating shards in indices.stats/13_fields tests

MixedClusterClientYamlTestSuiteIT sometimes fails when executing the
indices.stats/13_fields/* REST tests. It does not reproduce locally
but the execution logs show that it failed when a shard is relocating
during the set up execution. This commit change the set up so that it
now waits for all shards to be active before executing the tests.

closes #26732, #27146
