Watcher: Add execution state to watch status (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2699)

The execution state is kind of a global indicator if a watch has been
running successfully and is used by the watcher UI.

However this field is only stored in the watch history but not part of
the watch status, thus it is not available everywhere. In order to
simplify the watcher UI this commit also adds the field to the
watch status which is stored together with the watch.

It is stored under the `status.execution_state` field as `status.state`
is already taken. This is also reflects with the name of the java class.

The WatchStatus class does not contain serialization checks, as this is
intended to be backported to 6.x, where those checks will be added.

Once the backport is done, the old execution state field can be fully
deleted from the master branch in another commit (syncing with Kibana
folks required).
