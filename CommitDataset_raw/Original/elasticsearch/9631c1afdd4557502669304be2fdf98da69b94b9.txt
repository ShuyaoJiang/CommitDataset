Fix excessive increments in soft delete policy (#38813)

In this case, we were incrementing the policy too much. This means on
every iteration we actually keep increasing the minimum retained
sequence number, even with leases in place. It was a bug from when the
soft deletes policy had retention leases incorporated into it. This
commit fixes this bug by ensuring we only increment in the proper
places, and adds careful tests for the various situations.
