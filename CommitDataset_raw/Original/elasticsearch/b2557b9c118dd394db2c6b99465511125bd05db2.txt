Skip GeoIpProcessorFactoryTests on Windows (#29005)

With this commit we skip all GeoIpProcessorFactoryTests on Windows.
These tests use a MappedByteBuffer which will keep its file mappings
until it is garbage-collected. As a consequence, the corresponding
file appears to be still in use, Windows cannot delete it and the test
will fail in teardown.

Closes #29001
