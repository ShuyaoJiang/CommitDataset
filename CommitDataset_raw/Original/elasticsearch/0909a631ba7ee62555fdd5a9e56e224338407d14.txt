Add non-X-Pack centric rollup endpoints (#36383)

* Add non-X-Pack centric rollup endpoints

This commit adds new endpoints for rollup that do not have _xpack in
their path. The purpose for this change is to take these endpoints into
6.x as well so that they can be available in mixed cluster tests too. A
follow-up change will deprecate the use of _xpack in the rollup
endpoints. And finally, in the future, we would remove the _xpack
endpoints.

* Remove import

* Fix typo
