Avoid NPE on shard changes action (#32630)

If a leader index is deleted while there is an active follower, the
follower will send shard changes requests bound for the leader
index. Today this will result in a null pointer exception because there
will not be an index routing table for the index. A null pointer
exception looks like a bug to a user so this commit addresses this by
throwing an index not found exception instead.
