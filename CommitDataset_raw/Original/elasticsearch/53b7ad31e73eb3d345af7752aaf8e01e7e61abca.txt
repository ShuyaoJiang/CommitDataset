Use short name for invoking wrapper script

When starting a node in standalone tests, we sometimes use a wrapper
script as opposed to starting Elasticsearch directly (this is used for
backgrounding). On Windows, the path to this wrapper script can be
exceptionally long, exceeding the length of a batch script that cmd.exe
will invoke without whining. This commit replaces using the full path
name for this wrapper script by the short name for the wrapper script.

Additionally, the data, configuration, and jvm.options paths can also
end up being too long so we shorten those too. Care has to be taken with
the data directory because we usually rely on the node creating it on
startup but doing that will not be compatible with getting the short
name as that requires the directory already existing. Therefore, we
create that directory on-demand immediately before actually resolving
the short name.
