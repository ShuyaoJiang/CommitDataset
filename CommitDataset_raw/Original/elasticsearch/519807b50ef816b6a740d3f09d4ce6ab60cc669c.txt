[Tests] Wait for shards to be active in FullClusterRestartIT.testWatcher()

The test `testWatcher()` sometimes fails because the shards are not
active when searching in the `bwc_watch_index` or `.watcher-history`
index. This commit ensured that no shards are relocating or initializing
before executing the searches. It also swallows any error 503 Service
Unavailable when expecting a given number of search hits.
