Clean up "unused variable" warnings (#31876)

This change cleans up "unused variable" warnings. There are several cases were we 
most likely want to suppress the warnings (especially in the client documentation test
where the snippets contain many unused variables). In a lot of cases the unused
variables can just be deleted though.
