render non-ElasticsearchException in ILM (#31284)

ILM was rendering exceptions using the exception helper that
basically ignores simply rendering non-elasticsearch exceptions when
no details are desired. This commit updates the method used to still be
a rather simple rendering of the exception. The rendering lacks
all the causes, but does a sufficient job in rendering the top-level
message for one of our most expected exceptions... IllegalArgumentException
