Continue registering pipelines after one pipeline parse failure. (#28752)

Ingest has been failing to apply existing pipelines from cluster-state
into the in-memory representation that are no longer valid. One example of
this is a pipeline with a script processor. If a cluster starts up with scripting
disabled, these pipelines will not be loaded. Even though GETing a pipeline worked,
indexing operations claimed that this pipeline did not exist. This is because one
gets information from cluster-state and the other is from an in-memory data-structure.

Now, two things happen
1. suppress the exceptions until after other successful pipelines are loaded
2. replace failed pipelines with a placeholder pipeline

If the pipeline execution service encounters the stubbed pipeline, it is known that
something went wrong at the time of pipeline creation and an exception was thrown to
the user at some point at start-up.

closes #28269.
