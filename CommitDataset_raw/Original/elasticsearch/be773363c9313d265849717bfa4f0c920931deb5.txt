Do not fail requests on exceptions from native roles store (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2857)

This commit changes the handling of exceptions when retrieving roles from the native roles store.
Previously, exceptions would have caused the request to terminate and the exception would be
sent back to the user. This makes for a bad experience when a cluster hasn't been upgraded to the
latest index format and anonymous access is enabled with a native role as all requests without
preemptive basic authentication would result in an exception. The change here is to allow the
request to continue processing. Once the security index is up to date, the roles cache is cleared
so that the native roles can be picked up.
