Register ResyncTask.Status as a NamedWriteable (#36610)

Today, ResyncTask.Status is not registered, but appears as a task status
sometimes, leading to `Failed to deserialize response from handler` exceptions:

    java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unknown NamedWriteable [org.elasticsearch.tasks.Task$Status][resync]

This commit adds the missing registration.
