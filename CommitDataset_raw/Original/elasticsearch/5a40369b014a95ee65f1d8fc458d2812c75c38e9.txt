Fix testRefreshingMultipleTimesWithinWindowSucceeds (#39701)

Previously all the threads were writing the received tokens to a
HashSet. In cases with many threads, sometimes (1 every ~25 tests)
calling size() on the HashSet returned 2 even though it seemed to
contain only one String and there was no evidence from logging that
threadSecurityClient.refreshToken() ever returned a different
access or refresh token.

This commit changes the test to use a ConcurrentHashMap instead,
checking that we only received one pair of access token/refresh token
eventually. It also adds a check so that we won't take into consideration
tokens that are returned after 30s, hence not in the concurrent refresh
time window.
