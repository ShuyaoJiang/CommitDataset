Add a new `_ignored` meta field. (#29658)

This adds a new `_ignored` meta field which indexes and stores fields that have
been ignored at index time because of the `ignore_malformed` option. It makes
malformed documents easier to identify by using `exists` or `term(s)` queries
on the `_ignored` field.

Closes #29494
