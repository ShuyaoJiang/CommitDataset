Pass over _routing value with more_like_this items to be retrieved (#24679)

When retrieving documents to extract terms from as part of a more like this query, the _routing value can be set, yet it gets lost. That leads to not being able to retrieve the documents, hence more_like_this used to return no matches all the time.

Closes #23699
