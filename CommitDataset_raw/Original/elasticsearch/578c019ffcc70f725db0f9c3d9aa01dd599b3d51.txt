Support concurrent refresh of refresh tokens (#39631)

Co-authored-by: Jay Modi jaymode@users.noreply.github.com

This change adds support for the concurrent refresh of access
tokens as described in #36872
In short it allows subsequent client requests to refresh the same token that
come within a predefined window of 60 seconds to be handled as duplicates
of the original one and thus receive the same response with the same newly
issued access token and refresh token.
In order to support that, two new fields are added in the token document. One
contains the instant (in epoqueMillis) when a given refresh token is refreshed
and one that contains a pointer to the token document that stores the new
refresh token and access token that was created by the original refresh.
A side effect of this change, that was however also a intended enhancement
for the token service, is that we needed to stop encrypting the string
representation of the UserToken while serializing. ( It was necessary as we
correctly used a new IV for every time we encrypted a token in serialization, so
subsequent serializations of the same exact UserToken would produce
different access token strings)

This change also handles the serialization/deserialization BWC logic:

    In mixed clusters we keep creating tokens in the old format and
    consume only old format tokens
    In upgraded clusters, we start creating tokens in the new format but
    still remain able to consume old format tokens (that could have been
    created during the rolling upgrade and are still valid)
    When reading/writing TokensInvalidationResult objects, we take into
    consideration that pre 7.1.0 these contained an integer field that carried
    the attempt count

Resolves #36872
