nested: In case of a single type the _id field should be added to the nested document instead of _uid field.

When `index.mapping.single_type` is `true` the `_uid` field is not used and instead `_id` field is used.
Prior to this change nested documents would in this case still use the `_uid` field to mark to what root
document they belong to. In case of deleting documents this could lead to only the root  Lucene document
to be deleted and not the nested Lucene documents. This broke the docid block ordering the block join
relies on in order to work correctly and thus causing the `nested` query, `nested` aggregation, nested sorting
and nested inner hits to either fail or yield incorrect results.

This bug only manifests in 6.0.0-ALPHA2 release and snaphots (5.5.0-SNAPSHOT, 5.6.0-SNAPSHOT, 6.0.0-SNAPSHOT).
