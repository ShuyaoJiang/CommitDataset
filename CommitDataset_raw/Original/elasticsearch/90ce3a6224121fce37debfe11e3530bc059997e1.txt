[Rollup] Fix Caps Comparator to handle calendar/fixed time (#33336)

The comparator used TimeValue parsing, which meant it couldn't handle
calendar time.  This fixes the comparator to handle either (and potentially
mixed).  The mixing shouldn't be an issue since the validation code
upstream will prevent it, but was simplest to allow the comparator
to handle both.
