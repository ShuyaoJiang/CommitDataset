Give audit logs more time to show up in SQL tests

CI has been failing since we had to remove our tweaks to the audit
logging configuration due to
https://github.com/elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch/issues/2705

So we increase the timeout. The timeout is very very long, but it
seems like we need it for CI which is often slow.
