Stop forking groovyc (#30471)

This is a follow-up to our previous change to only fork javac if needed
to respect the Java compiler home (via JAVA_HOME). This commit makes the
same change for groovyc: we only fork groovyc if the JDK for Gradle is
not the JDK specified for the compiler (via JAVA_HOME).
