[ML] Rename log structure to file structure (#33421)

Many files supplied to the upcoming ML data preparation
functionality will not be "log" files.  For example,
CSV files are generally not "log" files.  Therefore it
makes sense to rename library that determines the
structure of these files.

Although "file structure" could be considered too broad,
as the library currently only works with a few text
formats, in the future it may be extended to work with
more formats.
