Decouple ClusterStateTaskListener & ClusterApplier (#30809)

Today, the `ClusterApplier` and `MasterService` both use the
`ClusterStateTaskListener` interface to notify their callers when asynchronous
activities have completed. However, this is not wholly appropriate: none of the
callers into the `ClusterApplier` care about the `ClusterState` arguments that
they receive.  This change introduces a dedicated ClusterApplyListener
interface for callers into the `ClusterApplier`, to distinguish these listeners
from the real `ClusterStateTaskListener`s that are waiting for responses from
the `MasterService`.
