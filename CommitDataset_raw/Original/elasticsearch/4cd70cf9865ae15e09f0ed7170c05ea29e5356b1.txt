Block older operations on primary term transition

Today a replica learns of a new primary term via a cluster state update
and there is not a clean transition between the older primary term and
the newer primary term. This commit modifies this situation so that:
 - a replica shard learns of a new primary term via replication
   operations executed under the mandate of the new primary
 - when a replica shard learns of a new primary term, it blocks
   operations on older terms from reaching the engine, with a clear
   transition point between the operations on the older term and the
   operations on the newer term

This work paves the way for a primary/replica sync on primary
promotion. Future work will also ensure a clean transition point on a
promoted primary, and prepare a replica shard for a sync with the
promoted primary.
