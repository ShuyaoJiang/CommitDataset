InternalEngineTests.testConcurrentOutOfOrderDocsOnReplica should use two documents (#30121)

We were recently looking at bugs that can only occur if two different documents were indexed concurrently. For example, what happens if the local checkpoint advances above the sequence number of  a document that's being indexed. That can only happen if another concurrent operation caused the checkpoint to advance. It has to be another document to allow concurrency as we acquire a per uid lock.While our investigation proved that the suspected bug doesn't exists, we still discovered our unit testing coverage is not good enough to cover this case. 

This PR extend the test concurrent out of order replica processing to use two documents in its history.
