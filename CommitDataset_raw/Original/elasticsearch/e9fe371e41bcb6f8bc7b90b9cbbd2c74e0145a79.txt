Give the engine the whole index buffer size on init. (#31105)

Currently the engine is initialized with a hardcoded 256MB of RAM. Elasticsearch
may never use more than that for a given shard, `IndexingMemoryController` only
has the power to flush segments to disk earlier in case multiple shards are
actively indexing and use too much memory.

While this amount of memory is enough for an index with few fields and larger
RAM buffers are not expected to improve indexing speed, this might actually be
little for an index that has many fields.

Kudos to @bleskes for finding it out when looking into a user who was reporting
a **much** slower indexing speed when upgrading from 2.x to 5.6 with an index
that has about 20,000 fields.
