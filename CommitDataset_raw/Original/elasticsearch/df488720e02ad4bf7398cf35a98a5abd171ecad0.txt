[CCR] Make shard follow tasks more resilient for restarts (#37239)

If a running shard follow task needs to be restarted and
the remote connection seeds have changed then
a shard follow task currently fails with a fatal error.

The change creates the remote client lazily and adjusts
the errors a shard follow task should retry.

This issue was found in test failures in the recently added
ccr rolling upgrade tests. The reason why this issue occurs
more frequently in the rolling upgrade test is because ccr
is setup in local mode (so remote connection seed will become stale) and
all nodes are restarted, which forces the shard follow tasks to get
restarted at some point during the test. Note that these tests
cannot be enabled yet, because this change will need to be backported
to 6.x first. (otherwise the issue still occurs on non upgraded nodes)

I also changed the RestartIndexFollowingIT to setup remote cluster
via persistent settings and to also restart the leader cluster. This
way what happens during the ccr rolling upgrade qa tests, also happens
in this test.
