Support roles with application privileges against wildcard applications (#40398)

This commit introduces 2 changes to application privileges:

- The validation rules now accept a wildcard in the "suffix" of an application name.
  Wildcards were always accepted in the application name, but the "valid filename" check
  for the suffix incorrectly prevented the use of wildcards there.

- A role may now be defined against a wildcard application (e.g. kibana-*) and this will
  be correctly treated as granting the named privileges against all named applications.
  This does not allow wildcard application names in the body of a "has-privileges" check, but the
  "has-privileges" check can test concrete application names against roles with wildcards.
