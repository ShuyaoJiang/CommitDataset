Reduce the overhead of timeouts and low-level search cancellation. (#25776)

Setting a timeout or enforcing low-level search cancellation used to make us
wrap the collector and check either the current time or whether the search
task was cancelled for every collected document. This can be significant
overhead on cheap queries that match many documents.

This commit changes the approach to wrap the bulk scorer rather than the
collector and exponentially increase the interval between two consecutive
checks in order to reduce the overhead of those checks.
