Convert Realm.authenticate to provide a richer result (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1932)

This allows for messages to be returned, and distinguishes between 4 different results:
- I have authenticated the user
- I don't know how to authenticate that user. Try another realm.
- I tried to authenticate the user, but failed. Try another realm.
- I tried to authenticate the user, but failed. Fail the authentication attempt.
