Moved job lifecycle over to persistent tasks

Also replaced the DELETING status from JobState with a boolean flag on Job. The state of a job is now stored inside a persistent task in cluster state. Jobs that aren't running don't have a persistent task, so I moved that notion of being deleted to the job config itself.
