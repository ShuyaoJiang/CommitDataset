[Painless] Add def to boxed type casts (#36506)

This adds casts for the def type to all standard boxed types. Prior to this certain 
casts such as def [long/Long] -> Double would fail which does not follow the 
goals of the Painless casting model to remove the need for explicit boxing. This 
also creates symmetry with the casts for the newly created bridge methods 
being called at run-time.
