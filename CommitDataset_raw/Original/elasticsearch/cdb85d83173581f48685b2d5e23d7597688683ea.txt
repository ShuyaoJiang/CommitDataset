Watcher: Run tests without security enabled (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3060)

In order to support the repository split, this changes the
`AbstractWatcherIntegrationTestCase` to not run with security enabled.

We have a dedicated QA project called `smoke-test-watcher-with-security`,
where tests that explicitely need security should be running.

This commit removes the possibility to enable security as part of the
test case. In addition some tests have been moved over to the dedicated
project.

In addition the `timewarp` functionality cannot be configured with a
system property anymore. This would not have worked anyway, because
tests were already dependent on that  functionality and did not have any
other means of running. A bit of redundant code was removed due to this.
