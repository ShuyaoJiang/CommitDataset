HLRC: Fix Reindex from remote query logic (#36908)

The query object was incorrectly added to the remote object in the
xcontent. This fix moves the query back into the source, if it was
passed in as part of the RemoteInfo. It also adds a IPv6 test for
reindex from remote such that we can properly validate this.
