Remove HTTP max content length leniency (#29337)

I am not sure why we have this leniency for HTTP max content length, it
has been there since the beginning
(5ac51ee93feab6c75fcbe979b9bb338962622c2e) with no explanation of its
source. That said, our philosophy today is different than the philosophy
of the past where Elasticsearch would be quite lenient in its handling
of settings and today we aim for predictability for both users and
us. This commit removes leniency in the parsing of
http.max_content_length.
