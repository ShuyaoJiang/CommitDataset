Fix missing columns to be a 400 error (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2123)

1. We talked about doing 422 but that doesn't work because the netty plugin
maps 422 -> 400 and I didn't think it was worth changing that right now.
2. Missing columns in the `WHERE` clause still cause a 500 response because
we don't resolve the `SELECT` part if there is an error in the `WHERE`
clause.
