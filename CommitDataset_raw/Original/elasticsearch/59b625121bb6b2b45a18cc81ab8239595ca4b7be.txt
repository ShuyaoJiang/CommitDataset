Ensure `InternalEngineTests.testConcurrentWritesAndCommits` doesn't pile up commits (#25367)

`InternalEngineTests.testConcurrentWritesAndCommits` can be very heavy on disks
if threads are slow and the main thread keeps on pulling commit points holding on
to many many segments. This commit adds some quadratic backoff to not pile up too many
commits and to make sure indexing threads can make progress. This also now doesn't do
busy waiting but waits on a latch with a timeout.

Closes #25110
