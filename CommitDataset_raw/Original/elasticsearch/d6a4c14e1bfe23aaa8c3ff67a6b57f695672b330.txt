Painless: Restructure/Clean Up of Spec Documentation (#31013)

Full restructure of the spec into new sections for operators, statements, scripts, functions, lambdas, and regexes.  Split of operators into 6 sections, a table, reference, array, numeric, boolean, and general.  Clean up of all operators sections.  Sporadic clean up else where.
