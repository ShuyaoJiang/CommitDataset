Introduce Mapping ActionListener (#39538)

* Introduce Safer Chaining of Listeners

* The motivation here is to make reasoning about chains of `ActionListener` a little easier, by providing a safe method for nesting `ActionListener` that guarantees that a response is never dropped. Also, it dries up the code a little by removing the need to repeat `listener::onFailure` and `listener.onResponse` over and over.
* Refactored a number of obvious/easy spots to use the new listener constructor
