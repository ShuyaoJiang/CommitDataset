Create security bootstrap checks early to access secure settings safely (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2282)

We close the secure settings in core before we pull bootstrap checks.
This means if a bootstrap check like the `TokenPassphraseBootstrapCheck`
accesses a secure setting that late it will fail due to an exception in
the `PKCS12KeyStore`. This change moves the bootstrap check creation
to the plugin constructor and adds a dummy setting to the integTest
that triggers the bootstrap checks.
