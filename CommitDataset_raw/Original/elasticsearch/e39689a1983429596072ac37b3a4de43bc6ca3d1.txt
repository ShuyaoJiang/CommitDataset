Send only ops after checkpoint in file-based recovery with soft-deletes (#33190)

Today a file-based recovery will replay all existing translog operations
from the primary on a replica so that that replica can have a full
history in translog as the primary. However, with soft-deletes enabled,
we should not do it because:

1. All operations before the local checkpoint of the safe commit exist in
the commit already.

2. The number of operations before the local checkpoint may be considerable
and requires a significant amount of time to replay on a replica.
