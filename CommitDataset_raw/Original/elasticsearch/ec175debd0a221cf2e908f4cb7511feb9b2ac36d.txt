Enables security to work with index aliases (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1496)

This commit enables security to work with an index named .security (as
it could before) OR an alias named .security that points to a concrete
index by a different name that has the security index.  This prepares
the ability to migrate from a 5.x to 6.x security index that allows
changing and re-indexing the underlying security index while maintaining
a .security alias that points to the underlying updated index.
