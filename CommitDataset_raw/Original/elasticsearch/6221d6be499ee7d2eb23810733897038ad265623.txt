SQL: Fix issue with always false filter involving functions (#36830)

When a filter is evaluated to false then it becomes a LocalRelation
with an EmptyExecutable. The LocalRelation in turn, becomes a
LocalExec and the the SkipQueryIfFoldingProjection was wrongly
converting it to a SingletonExecutable. Moreover made a change, so
that the queries without FROM clause, which are supposed to return a
single row, to become a LocalRelation with a SingletonExecutable
instead of EmptyExecutable to avoid mixing up with the ones operating
on a table but with a filter that evaluates to false.

Fixes: #35980
