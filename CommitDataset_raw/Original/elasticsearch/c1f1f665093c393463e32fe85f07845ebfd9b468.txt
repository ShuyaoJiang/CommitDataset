Scripting: Replace advanced and native scripts with ScriptEngine docs (#24603)

This commit documents how to write a `ScriptEngine` in order to use
expert internal apis, such as using Lucene directly to find index term
statistics. These documents prepare the way to remove both native
scripts and IndexLookup.

The example java code is actually compiled and tested under a new gradle
subproject for example plugins. This change does not yet breakup
jvm-example into the new examples dir, which should be done separately.
