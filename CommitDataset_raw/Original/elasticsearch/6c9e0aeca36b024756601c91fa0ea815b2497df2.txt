Adds API to assign or change the policy for an index (#31277)

* Adds API to assign or change the policy for an index

This api will change `index.lifecycle.name` for all indexes in the
provided pattern as long as they are not currently in the shrink action.

Later changes will loosen this restriction so an index is only reject
if it is currently in the shrink action AND the diff between the old
and new policy includes changes to the shrink action.

Also later changes will detect if the current step is not present in
the new policy and move the index onto the next available step

* Changes name to SetPolicyForIndexAction

Also changes all related Classes and api endpoints

* fixes tests
