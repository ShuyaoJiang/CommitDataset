Ignore .DS_Store files on macOS

Finder creates these files if you browse a directory there. These files
are really annoying, but it's an incredible pain for users that these
files are created unbeknownst to them, and then they get in the way of
Elasticsearch starting. This commit adds leniency on macOS only to skip
these files.
