Default max concurrent search req. numNodes * 5 (#31171)

We moved to 1 shard by default which caused some issues in how many
concurrent shard requests we allow by default. For instance searching
a 5 shard index on a single node will now be executed serially per shard
while we want these cases to have a good concurrency out of the box. This
change moves to `numNodes * 5` which corresponds to the default we used to 
have in the previous version.

Closes #30994
