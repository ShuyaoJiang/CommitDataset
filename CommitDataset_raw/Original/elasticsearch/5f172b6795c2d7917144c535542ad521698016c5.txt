[Feature] Adding a char_group tokenizer (#24186)

=== Char Group Tokenizer

The `char_group` tokenizer breaks text into terms whenever it encounters
a
character which is in a defined set. It is mostly useful for cases where
a simple
custom tokenization is desired, and the overhead of use of the
<<analysis-pattern-tokenizer, `pattern` tokenizer>>
is not acceptable.

=== Configuration

The `char_group` tokenizer accepts one parameter:

`tokenize_on_chars`::
    A string containing a list of characters to tokenize the string on.
Whenever a character
    from this list is encountered, a new token is started. Also supports
escaped values like `\\n` and `\\f`,
    and in addition `\\s` to represent whitespace, `\\d` to represent
digits and `\\w` to represent letters.
    Defaults to an empty list.

=== Example output

```The 2 QUICK Brown-Foxes jumped over the lazy dog's bone for $2```

When the configuration `\\s-:<>` is used for `tokenize_on_chars`, the
above sentence would produce the following terms:

```[ The, 2, QUICK, Brown, Foxes, jumped, over, the, lazy, dog's, bone,
for, $2 ]```
