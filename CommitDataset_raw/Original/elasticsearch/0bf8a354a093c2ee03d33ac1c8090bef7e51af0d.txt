Use `global_ordinals_hash` execution mode when sorting by sub aggregations. (#26014)

This is a safer default since sorting by sub aggregations prevents these
aggregations from being deferred. `global_ordinals_hash` will at least
make sure that we do not use memory for buckets that are not collected.

Closes #24359
