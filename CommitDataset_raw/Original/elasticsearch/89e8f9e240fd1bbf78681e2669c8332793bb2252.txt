Adds concept of a safe action (#31971)

* Adds concept of a safe action

A safe action is one that does not have unwanted side effects if the
configuration of the action is change in the policy while and index is
executing the action.

This commit formalises this concept with the only current unsafe action
being ShrinkAction. It also adds testing around this and add a method
to LifecyclePolicy which returns whether the action for the provided
StepKey is safe.

* Makes IndexLifecycleRunners checks use the safe indications instead of
hardcoding shrink action

* Fixes test failure
