TEST: Use different translog dir for a new engine

In #testPruneOnlyDeletesAtMostLocalCheckpoint, we create a new engine
but mistakenly use the same translog directory of  the existing engine.
This prevents translog files from cleaning up when closing the engines.

This commit makes sure to use a separate directory for each engine in
this tes.
