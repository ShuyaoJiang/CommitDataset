JDBC metadata integration with security (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2806)

I realized that we weren't running our DatabaseMetaData tests. One thing led to another and I made these changes:
1. Got the DatabaseMetaData tests running in all three of our QA projects.
2. Fixed the SecurityCatalogFilter to work with `SqlGetIndicesAction`. It worked before, but only for requests that were a `SqlAction` as well as `SqlGetIndicesAction`.
3. Added security test for the JDBC DatabaseMetaData requests. These mirror exactly the security tests that we use for `SHOW TABLES` and `DESCRIBE` but cover the JDBC actions.
