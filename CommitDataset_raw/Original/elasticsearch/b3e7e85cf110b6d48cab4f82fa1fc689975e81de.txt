Let search phases override max concurrent requests

If the query coordinating node is also a data node that holds all the
shards for a search request, we can end up recursing through the can
match phase (because we send a local request and on response in the
listener move to the next shard and do this again, without ever having
returned from previous shards). This recursion can lead to stack
overflow for even a reasonable number of indices (daily indices over a
sixty days with five shards per day is enough to trigger the stack
overflow). Moreover, all this execution would be happening on a network
thread (the thread that initially received the query). With this commit,
we allow search phases to override max concurrent requests. This allows
the can match phase to avoid recursing through the shards towards a
stack overflow.
