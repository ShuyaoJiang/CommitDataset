Filter out upgraded version index settings when starting index following (#38838)

The `index.version.upgraded` and `index.version.upgraded_string` are likely
to be different between leader and follower index. In the event that
a follower index gets restored on a upgraded node while the leader index
is still on non-upgraded nodes.
