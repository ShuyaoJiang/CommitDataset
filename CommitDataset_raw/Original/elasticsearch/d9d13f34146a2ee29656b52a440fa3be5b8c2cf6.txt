Use project dependency instead of substitutions for distributions (#37730)

Currently integration tests which use either bwc snapshot versions or
the current version of elasticsearch depend on project substitutions to
link to the build of those artifacts. Likewise, vagrant tests use
dependency substitutions to get to bwc snapshots of rpm and debs.
This commit changes those to depend on the relevant project/configuration
and removes the dependency substitutions for distributions we do not
publish.
