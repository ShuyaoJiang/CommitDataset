Remove unused search plugin extension (#27943)

Search response listeners should not be exposed in search plugin.
Support was added but reverted right after (not present in any release).
Though the SearchPlugin still contains a default definition for search response listeners
due to a broken revert. This change removes this extension point that is basically no-op.
