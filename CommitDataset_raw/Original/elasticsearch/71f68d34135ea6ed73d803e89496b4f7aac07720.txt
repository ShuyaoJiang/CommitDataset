Tests: Remove watcher ensureWachterStarted/Stopped methods (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3798)

Tests have been failing because of out of order cluster state processing
or because of stopping/starting was still in progress. Current tests do
not do further stop/start tries after the first leading to potential
being stuck in an unwanted state. This commit removes the methods
checking for the state being started or stopped in favor of using the
stopWatcher/startWatcher methods which now check if the desired state is
reached and otherwise issue another start/stop command.
