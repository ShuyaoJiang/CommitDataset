Avoid polluting download stats on builds (#38660)

Recently we changed where we source released artifacts for usage in
backwards compatibility tests. We now source these from
artifacts.elastic.co. To avoid polluting the download stats from builds,
we want to add the X-Elastic-No-KPI header to requests from
artifacts.elastic.co. To do this, we hack the Ivy feature of custom HTTP
header credentials and specify our desired headers.
