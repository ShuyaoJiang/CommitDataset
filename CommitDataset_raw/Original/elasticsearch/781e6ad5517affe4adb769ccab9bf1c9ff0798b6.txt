Fixes suggestion generics (#32706)

* Fixes suggestion generics

This solves a compile problem in Eclipse where Eclipse could not
resolve the generics for the options field in `PhraseSuggestion.Entry`.
But I think this is also a good change in general because
`PhraseSuggestion.Entry` is now declaring the specific `Option`
implementation it requires rather than `Suggest.Entry.Option` which is
more general and could lead to weird bugs. `CompletionSuggestion.Entry`
and `TermSuggestion.Entry` already declare the more specific class they
use so I think this was an oversight in `PhaseSuggestion.Entry`
