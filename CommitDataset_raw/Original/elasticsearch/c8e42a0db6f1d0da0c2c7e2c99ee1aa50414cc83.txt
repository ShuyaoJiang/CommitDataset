Update logstash mappings to use pipeline.id + correct metric types (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2045)

In logstash parlance there really is no pipeline.name, its pipeline.id

This also removes support for deprecated gauge types `text` and `boolean` we will be removing those soon in logstash

This also renames `counters` to `long_counters` to be more explicit and for consistency with the gauge type. Also, if we ever decide to add other types of counters this will be more clear
