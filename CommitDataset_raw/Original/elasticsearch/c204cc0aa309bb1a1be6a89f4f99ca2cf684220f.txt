SQL: removed fallback to exact prediction in the parser (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3522)

The grammar definition should not require the exact prediction on the
listener. Falling back to it hides potential ambiguities.
Moved it to a separate method so it can be enabled for debugging in
development similar to Painless picky mode.
