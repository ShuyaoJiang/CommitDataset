Short-circuit rebalancing when disabled (#40942)

Today if `cluster.routing.rebalance.enable: none` then rebalancing is disabled,
but we still execute `balanceByWeights()` and perform some rather expensive
calculations before discovering that we cannot rebalance any shards. In a large
cluster this can make cluster state updates occur rather slowly. With this
change we check earlier whether rebalancing is globally disabled and, if so,
avoid the rebalancing process entirely.
