Refactored GeoHashGrid unit tests (#37832)

* Refactored GeoHashGrid unit tests

This change allows other grid aggregations to reuse the same tests.

The change mostly just moves code to the base classes, trying to
keep changes to a bare minimum.

* rename createInternalGeoHashGridBucket to createInternalGeoGridBucket

* indentation
