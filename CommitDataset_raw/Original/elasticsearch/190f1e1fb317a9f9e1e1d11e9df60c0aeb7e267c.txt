Fix synonym phrase query expansion for cross_fields parsing (#28045)

* Fix synonym phrase query expansion for cross_fields parsing

The `cross_fields` mode for query parser ignores phrase query generated by multi-word synonyms.
In such case only the first field of each analyzer group is kept. This change fixes this issue
by expanding the phrase query for each analyzer group to **all** fields using a disjunction max query.
