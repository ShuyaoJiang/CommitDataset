Fix Rollup's metadata parser (#36791)

The parser used for rollup configs in _meta fields was not able to
handle unrelated data in the meta field.  If an unrelated object
was encountered, it would half-consume the JSON object, realize it
wasn'ta rollup config, then stop parsing.  This would leave the object
halfway consumed and the parsing framework would throw an exception.

This commit replaces the parsing logic with a set of minimal parsers,
each for the specific component we care about (`_doc`, `_meta`,
`_rollup`) and configured to ignore unknown fields where applicable.

More verbose, but less hacky than before and should be more robust.

Also adds tests (randomized and explicit) to make sure this doesn't
break in the future.
