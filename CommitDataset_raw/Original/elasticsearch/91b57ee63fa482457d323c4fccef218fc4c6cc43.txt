Add bootstrap check that enforces TLS if a production license is in the local clusterstate (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2499)

This change will enforce transport SSL to be enforced if security is enabled and the
license in the clusterstate is a production license. The cluster state is loaded from
local storage such that we don't need to join a cluster to make these checks. Yet, the cluster
might have already got a different license if the node got disconnected while the license got
downgraded and then TLS got disabled. This corner case requires manual intervention which
we consider ok given the simplicity of this change.
