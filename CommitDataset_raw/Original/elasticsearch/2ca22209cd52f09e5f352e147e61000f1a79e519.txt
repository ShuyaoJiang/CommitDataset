Enable TLSv1.3 by default for JDKs with support (#38103)

This commit enables the use of TLSv1.3 with security by enabling us to
properly map `TLSv1.3` in the supported protocols setting to the
algorithm for a SSLContext. Additionally, we also enable TLSv1.3 by
default on JDKs that support it.

An issue was uncovered with the MockWebServer when TLSv1.3 is used that
ultimately winds up in an endless loop when the client does not trust
the server's certificate. Due to this, SSLConfigurationReloaderTests
has been pinned to TLSv1.2.

Closes #32276
