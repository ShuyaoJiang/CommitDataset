make tribe-node-license validation assume snapshot context (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2589)

Release tests were introduced that sets the `build.snapshot`
system property to `false` to mimic release builds. This invalidates
the hardcoded license signatures that were signed against the
integration test pub/priv keys. This commit modifies the
license-validation assertions to assume the test is running against
those test keys, and will be skipped/ignored when these assertions
fail (which should only occur with `build.snapshot=true`)
