Also skip Javadoc task for client JARs on JDK 10

We disabled the Javadoc task on JDK 10 due to an apparent bug in Javadoc
generation on JDK 10. However, the client JAR task sets up its own
Javadoc task for client JARs (because it merely copies the non-client
Javadoc JAR). This commit diables that task too, since the Javadocs for
the non-client JAR will not exist.
