[ML] Ignore unknown fields when parsing ML cluster state (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1924)

ML has two types of custom cluster state:

1. jobs
2. datafeeds

These need to be parsed from JSON in two situations:

1. Create/update of the job/datafeed
2. Restoring cluster state on startup

Previously we used exactly the same parser in both situations, but this
severely limits our ability to add new features.  This is because the
parser was very strict.  This was good when accepting create/update
requests from users, but when restoring cluster state from disk it meant
that we could not add new fields, as that would prevent reloading in
mixed version clusters.

This commit introduces a second parser that tolerates unknown fields for
each object that is stored in cluster state.  Then we use this more
tolerant parser when parsing cluster state, but still use the strict
parser when parsing REST requests.
