Remove no existing commits assertion in onInit()

This assertion does not hold if a shard is recovered from an empty store
but failed then retries. Moreover, if the openMode is CREATE_INDEX_*, we
pass CREATE mode to the IndexWriterConfig to create a new index and
overwrite the existing one.

Closes #27960
