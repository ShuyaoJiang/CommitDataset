Move trimming unsafe commits from engine ctor to store (#29260)

As follow up to #28245 , this PR removes the logic for selecting the 
right start commit from the Engine constructor in favor of explicitly
trimming them in the Store, before the engine is opened. This makes the
constructor in engine follow standard Lucene semantics and use the last
commit.
