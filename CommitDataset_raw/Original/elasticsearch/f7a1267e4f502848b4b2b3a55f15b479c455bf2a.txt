Build: Simplify rest spec hack configuration (#29149)

This commit creates the copyRestSpec task for rest integ tests
immediately on creation of the RestIntegTestTask instead of lazily in
afterEvaluate. This allows other projects to add additional rest specs
to be copied, instead of needing to create another parallel copy task.
