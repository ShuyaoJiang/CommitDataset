Settings: Cut over to affix settings where filters are needed (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3685)

x-pack makes extensive use of group settings in its exporters as well as
its notification services. This does not cope well with settings being
marked as filtered.

This replaces a fair share of group settings (unfortunately not all of
them) with affix key settings, allowing for better filtering and
registering of settings.
