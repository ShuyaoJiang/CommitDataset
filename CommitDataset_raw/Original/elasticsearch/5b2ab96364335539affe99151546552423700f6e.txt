Return index name and empty map for /{index}/_alias with no aliases

Previously in #24723 we changed the `_alias` API to not go through the
`RestGetIndicesAction` endpoint, instead creating a `RestGetAliasesAction` that
did the same thing.

This changes the formatting so that it matches the old formatting of the
endpoint, before:

```
GET /test-1/_alias

{ }
```

And after this change:

```
GET /test-1/_alias

{
  "test-1": {
    "aliases": {}
  }
}
```

This is related to #25090
