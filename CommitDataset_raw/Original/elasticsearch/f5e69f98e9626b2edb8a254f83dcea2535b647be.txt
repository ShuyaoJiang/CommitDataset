Find and use non local IPv4 address while testing IP filtering (#40234)

* Find and use non local IPv4 address while testing IP filtering

For pattern "n:localhost" PatternRule#isLocalhost() matches
any local address, loopback address.
[Note: I think for "localhost" this should not consider IP address
as a match when they are bound to network interfaces. It should just
be loopback address check unless the intent is to match all local addresses.
This class is adopted from Netty3 and I am not sure if this is intended
behavior or maybe I am missing something]

For now I have fixed this assuming the PatternRule#isLocalhost check is
correct by avoiding use of local address to check address denied.

Closes #40194
