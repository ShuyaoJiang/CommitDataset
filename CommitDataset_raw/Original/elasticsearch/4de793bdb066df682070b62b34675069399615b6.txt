[TEST] packaging: add debug logging (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3892)

* [TEST] packaging: add debug logging

Some tests have recurring but intermittent failure on opensuse 42 (see
issues mentioned below). Add debug logging for the places where they
occur. Fail fast when checking to see if es-with-xpack has come up.

For elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3817, elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3827, and elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3862
