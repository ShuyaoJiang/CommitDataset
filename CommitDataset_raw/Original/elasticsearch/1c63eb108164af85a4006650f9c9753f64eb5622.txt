Painless: Fix Bug with Duplicate PainlessClasses (#32110)

When building the PainlessMethods and PainlessFields they stored a reference to a 
PainlessClass. This reference was prior to "freezing" the PainlessClass so the data was 
both incomplete and mutable. This has been replaced with a target java class instead 
since the PainlessClass is accessible through a java class now and it requires no special 
modifications to get around a chicken and egg issue.
