No more using 'hybrid mmapfs / niofs' (#25944)

It looks a bit ambiguous here.

ElasticSearch no more using 'hybrid mmapfs / niofs' which chooses filesystem based on the file. It is any one of the mmapfs, niofs or simplefs depending on the operating system.
As quoted here https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.5/index-modules-store.html
