Remove NOREPLACE for /etc/elasticsearch in rpm and deb (#37839)

The /etc/elasticsearch directory is currently configured as a config
file with noreplace. However, the directory itself is not config, and
can lead to an entire /etc/elasticsearch.rpmsave directory in some
situations. This commit fixes the ospackage config to not specify those
file bits for the directory itself, but only the files underneath it.
