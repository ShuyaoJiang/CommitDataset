Prevent channel enqueue after selector close (#25478)

This commit adds additional protection to `ESSelector` and its
implementations to ensure that channels are not enqueued after the
selector is closed.

After a channel has been added to the queue, we check that the selector
is open. If it is not, then we remove the channel from the queue. If the
channel is removed successfully, we throw an `IllegalStateException`.
