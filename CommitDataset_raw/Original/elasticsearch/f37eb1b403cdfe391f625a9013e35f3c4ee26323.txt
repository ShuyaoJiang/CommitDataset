Remove tcp profile from low level nio channel (#27441)

This is related to #27260. Currently every nio channel has a profile
field. Profile is a concept that only relates to the tcp transport. Http
channels will not have profiles. This commit moves the profile from the
nio channel to the read context. The context is the level that protocol
specific features and logic should live.
