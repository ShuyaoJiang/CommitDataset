Add QA project and fixture based test for discovery-ec2 plugin (#31107)

This commit adds a new QA sub project to the discovery-ec2 plugin. 
This project uses a fixture to test the plugin using a multi-node cluster. 
Once all nodes are started, the nodes transport addresses are written 
in a file that is later read by the fixture.
