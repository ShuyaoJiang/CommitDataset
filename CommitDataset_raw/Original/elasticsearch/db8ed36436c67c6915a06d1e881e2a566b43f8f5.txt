Move Nullable into core (#29341)

This moves the `Nullable` annotation into the elasticsearch-core project, so it
may be used without relying entirely on the server jar. This will allow us to
decouple more pieces to make them smaller.

In addition, there were two different `Nullable` annotations, these have all
been moved to the ES version rather than the inject version.
