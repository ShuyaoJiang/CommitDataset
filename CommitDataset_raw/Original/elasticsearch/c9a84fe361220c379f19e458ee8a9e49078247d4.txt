SQL: Handle null literal for AND and OR in `WHERE` (#35236)

Change `nullable()` logic of AND and OR to false since in the Optimizer
we cannot fold to null as we might be handling and expression in the
SELECT clause.

Introduce folding of null for AND and OR expressions in PruneFilter()
since we now know that we are in HAVING or WHERE clause and we
can fold `null` to `false`

Fixes: #35088
