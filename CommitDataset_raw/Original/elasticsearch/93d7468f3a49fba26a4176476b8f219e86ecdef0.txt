ESIndexLevelReplicationTestCase doesn't support replicated failures but it's good to know what they are

Sometimes we have a test failure that hits an `UnsupportedOperationException` in this infrastructure. When
debugging you want to know what caused this unexpected failure, but right now we're silent about it. This
commit adds some information to the `UnsupportedOperationException`

Relates to #32127
