Introduce deterministic task queue (#32197)

The cluster coordination layer relies on timeouts to ensure that a cluster can
successfully form, and must also deal with concurrent activity in the cluster.
This commit introduces some infrastructure that will help us to
deterministically test components that use concurrency and/or timeouts.
