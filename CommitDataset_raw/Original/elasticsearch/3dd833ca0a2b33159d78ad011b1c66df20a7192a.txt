Plugins: Use one confirmation of all meta plugin permissions (#28366)

Currently meta plugins will ask for confirmation of security policy
exceptions for each bundled plugin. This commit collects the necessary
permissions of each bundled plugin, and asks for confirmation of all of
them at the same time.
