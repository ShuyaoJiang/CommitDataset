[ML] Reject headers supplied directly in the put datafeed body (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3853)

Since elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3254 security headers have been stored in datafeed cluster state
to allow the datafeed to run searches using the credentials of the user
who created/updated it.  As a result the parser was changed to read the
"headers" field so that cluster state could be reloaded.  However, this
meant that datafeed configs could be submitted with a "headers" field.
No security loophole arose from this, as subsequent code overwrites the
contents of any supplied headers.  But it could be confusing that an
erroneously supplied field did not cause a parse failure as it usually
would.

This change makes the config parser for datafeeds reject a "headers"
field.  Now only the metadata parser used for reloading cluster state
will read a "headers" field.
