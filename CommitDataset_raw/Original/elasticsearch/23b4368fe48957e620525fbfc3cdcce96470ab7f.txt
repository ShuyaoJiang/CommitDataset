Docs: Fix encrypt watcher sensitive data documentation (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4198)

The documentation mentions that the xpack.watcher.encrypt_sensitive_data
setting needs to be set in the keystore. This is wrong however, it needs
to be set in the standard elasticsearch yaml file.

relates elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4195
