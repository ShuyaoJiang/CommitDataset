Remove unused reference to filePermissionsCache (#31923)

Currently Role.Builder keeps a reference to the FieldPermissionsCache that is
passed into its constructors. This seems to be unused except for passing it on
to convertFromIndicesPrivileges() in the second ctor itself, but we don't need
to keep the internal reference in that case, so it can be removed.

Relates to #31876
