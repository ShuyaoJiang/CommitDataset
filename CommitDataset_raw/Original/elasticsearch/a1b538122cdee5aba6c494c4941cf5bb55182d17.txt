[test] java tests for archive packaging (#30734)

Ports the first couple tests for archive distributions from the old bats
project to the new java project that includes windows platforms,
consolidating them into one test method that tests that the
distributions can be extracted and their contents verified. Includes the
zip distributions which were not tested in the bats project.
