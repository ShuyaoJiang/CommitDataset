Packaging: Ensure upgrade_is_oss flag file is always deleted (#30732)

This commit ensures the delete of the upgrade_is_oss indicator for
the packaging tests is always deleted before each run. It works by
moving the check on version which skips the task into the doFirst block,
replacing the onlyIf.

closes #30682
