Docs: Reenable rollup docs tests (#34564)

We'd disabled them because we didn't have a way to clean up after each
test. I implemented #34342 which adds the clean ups so now we can
re-enable the tests.

In the `setup` sections we have to use `raw` requests instead of
`x-pack` requests because we don't have the json config for x-pack.

Closes #33319
