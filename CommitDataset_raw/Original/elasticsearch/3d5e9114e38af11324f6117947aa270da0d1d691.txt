Reduce connections used by MockNioTransport (#32620)

The MockNioTransport (similar to the MockTcpTransport) is used for integ
tests. The MockTcpTransport has always only opened a single for all of
its work. The MockNioTransport has awlays opened the default number of
connections (13). This means that every test where two transports
connect requires 26 connections. This is more than is necessary. This
commit modifies the MockNioTransport to only require 3 connections.
