Add exclusion option to `keep_types` token filter (#32012)

Currently the `keep_types` token filter includes all token types specified using
its `types` parameter. Lucenes TypeTokenFilter also provides a second mode where
instead of keeping the specified tokens (include) they are filtered out
(exclude). This change exposes this option as a new `mode` parameter that can
either take the values `include` (the default, if not specified) or `exclude`.

Closes #29277
