Fix highlighting on a keyword field that defines a normalizer (#27604)

* Fix highlighting on a keyword field that defines a normalizer

The `plain` and sometimes the `unified` highlighters need to re-analyze the content to highlight a field
This change makes sure that we don't ignore the normalizer defined on the keyword field for this analysis.
