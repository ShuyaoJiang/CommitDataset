[Rollup] Better error message when trying to set non-rollup index (#32965)

We don't allow the user to configure a rollup index against an
existing index, but the exceptions that we return are not clear about
that.  They indicate issues with metadata, instead of stating
the real reason (not allowed to use a non-rollup index to store
rollup data).

This makes the exception better, and adds a bit more testing
