Make self-generated license type configurable (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2000)

This is related to elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1778. This commit adds a setting
(xpack.license.self_generated.type) which allows the user to specify
what type of license will be self-generated on node startup. The allowed
types are basic or trial.
