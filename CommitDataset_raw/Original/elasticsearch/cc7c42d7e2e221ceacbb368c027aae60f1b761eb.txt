Allow built-in monitoring_user role to call GET _xpack API (#38060)

This PR adds the `monitor/xpack/info` cluster-level privilege to the built-in `monitoring_user` role.

This privilege is required for the Monitoring UI to call the `GET _xpack API` on the Monitoring Cluster. It needs to do this in order to determine the license of the Monitoring Cluster, which further determines whether Cluster Alerts are shown to the user or not.

Resolves #37970.
