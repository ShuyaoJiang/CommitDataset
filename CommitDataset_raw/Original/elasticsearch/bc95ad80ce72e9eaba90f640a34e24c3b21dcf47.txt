Add beats_system user to security (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4103)

This creates a new "beats_system" user and role with the same
privileges as the existing "logstash_system" user/role.

The "beat_system" user is also added as a managed user within
the "setup-passwords" command.

Users who upgrade from an earlier version of Elasticsearch/X-Pack
will need to manually set a password for the beats_system user via
the change password API (or Kibana UI)
