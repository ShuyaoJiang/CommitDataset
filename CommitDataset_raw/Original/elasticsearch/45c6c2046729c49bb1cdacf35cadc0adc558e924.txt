Enforce translog access via engine (#29542)

Today the translog of an engine is exposed and can be accessed directly.
While this exposure offers much flexibility, it also causes these troubles:

- Inconsistent behavior between translog method and engine method.
For example, rolling a translog generation via an engine also trims
unreferenced files, but translog's method does not.

- An engine does not get notified when critical errors happen in translog
as the access is direct.

This change isolates translog of an engine and enforces all accesses to
translog via the engine.
