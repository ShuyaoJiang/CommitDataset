INGEST: Fix Deprecation Warning in Script Proc. (#32407)

* Using short script form normalized to a map that used 'inline' instead of 'source' so a short form processor definition like:

```
{
 "script": "ctx.foo= 'bar'"
}
```

would always warn about the following deprecation:

```
  #! Deprecation: Deprecated field [inline] used, expected [source] 
```
