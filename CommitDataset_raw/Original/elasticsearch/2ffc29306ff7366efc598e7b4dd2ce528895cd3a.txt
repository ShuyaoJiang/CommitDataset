cd ES_HOME in elasticsearch-env (#39937)

This commit adds cd $ES_HOME to elasticsearch-env and removes it from
elasticsearch. This way, both elasticsearch and elasticsearch-cli are
executed with the working directory set to $ES_HOME. The need for the
fix arose from the following bug:
1. Explicitly set path.data to relative to ES_HOME path in
elasticsearch.yml.
2. Run elasticsearch from any directory. Elasticsearch is able to
correctly start.
3. Stop elasticsearch.
4. Run elasticsearch-node unsafe-bootstrap, not from ES_HOME directory.
It will fail with an exception.
This commit fixes the issue and adds a new test.

Also tests >=100 are renamed because alphabetic order does not work for
them.
