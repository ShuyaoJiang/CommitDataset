[LDAP] Support explicit "dn" attribute in group search (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1995)

The default for group_search.attribute is to search by DN, but explicitly setting that to dn
wouldn't work because the DN is returned in a special value in the result, and not in the attributes list.

This change detects when user_attribute is set to dn and treats it the same way as the default value.
