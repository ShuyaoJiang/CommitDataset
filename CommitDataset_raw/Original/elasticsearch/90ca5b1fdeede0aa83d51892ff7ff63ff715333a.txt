Fill LocalCheckpointTracker with Lucene commit (#34474)

Today we rely on the LocalCheckpointTracker to ensure no duplicate when
enabling optimization using max_seq_no_of_updates. The problem is that
the LocalCheckpointTracker is not fully reloaded when opening an engine
with an out-of-order index commit. Suppose the starting commit has seq#0
and seq#2, then the current LocalCheckpointTracker would return "false"
when asking if seq#2 was processed before although seq#2 in the commit.

This change scans the existing sequence numbers in the starting commit,
then marks these as completed in the LocalCheckpointTracker to ensure
the consistent state between LocalCheckpointTracker and Lucene commit.
