Fixes SecurityIntegTestCase so it always adds at least one alias (#33296)

* Fixes SecurityIntegTestCase so it always adds at least one alias

`SecurityIntegTestCase.createIndicesWithRandomAliases` could randomly
fail because its not gauranteed that the randomness of which aliases to
add to the `IndicesAliasesRequestBuilder` would always select at least
one alias to add. This change fixes the problem by keeping track of
whether we have added an alias to teh request and forcing the last
alias to be added if no other aliases have been added so far.
