[ML] Refactor aggregation response handling to make more flexible (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1795)

Currently, aggregated datafeeds construct JSON from the aggregation
response by traversing all nested aggregations. In order to
achieve this, multiple leaf aggregations are not supported. Also,
scenarios it makes it impossible to effectively use pipeline
aggregations as it will not ignore the intermediate bucket
aggregations.

This commit refactors AggregationToJsonProcessor in order to
support the above scenarios. This is achieved by only converting
the fields of interest, that is the job analysis fields.
