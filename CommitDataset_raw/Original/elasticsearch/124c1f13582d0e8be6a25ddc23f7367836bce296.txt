INGEST: Create Index Before Pipeline Execute (#32786)

* INGEST: Create Index Before Pipeline Execute

* Ensures that indices are created before the default pipeline setting is read to correcly handle the case of an index template containing a default pipeline (without the fix the first document does not get the pipeline applied as explained in #32758)
* closes #32758
