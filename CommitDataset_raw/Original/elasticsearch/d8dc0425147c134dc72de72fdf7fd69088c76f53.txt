[CCR] Handle leader index with no mapping correctly (#33770)

When a leader index is created, it may not have a mapping yet.
Currently if you follow such an index the shard follow tasks fail with
NoSuchElementException, because they expect a single mapping.

This commit fixes that, by allowing that a leader index does not yet have
a mapping.
