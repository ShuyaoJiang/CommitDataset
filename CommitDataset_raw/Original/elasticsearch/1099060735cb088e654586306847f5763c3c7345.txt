Test: Do not remove xpack templates when cleaning (#31642)

At the end of every `ESRestTestCase` we clean the cluster which includes
deleting all of the templates. If xpack is installed it'll automatically
recreate a few templates every time they are removed. Which is slow.

This change stops the cleanup from removing the xpack templates. It cuts
the time to run the docs tests more than in half and it probably saves a
bit more time on other tests as well.
