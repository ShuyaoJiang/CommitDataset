SQL: Perform lazy evaluation of mismatched mappings (#35676)

Move away from performing eager, fail-fast validation of mismatched
 mapping to a lazy evaluation based on the fields actually used in the
 query. This allows queries to run on the parts of the indices that
 "work" which is not just convenient but also a necessity for large
 mappings (like logging) where alignment is hard/impossible to achieve.
