Fix warnings in shrink ignore templates test

This commit fixes an issue with the REST test that the shrink API
ignores templates. The problem is that we have to use a BWC version of
the API (for the BWC tests) but this raises deprecation warnings. This
commit adds an expectation for these deprecation warnings.
