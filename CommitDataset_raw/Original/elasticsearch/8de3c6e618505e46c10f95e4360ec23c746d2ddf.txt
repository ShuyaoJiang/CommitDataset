Ignore date ranges containing 'now' when pre-processing a percolator query (#35160)

Today when a percolator query contains a date range then the query
analyzer extracts that range, so that at search time the `percolate` query
can exclude percolator queries efficiently that are never going to match.

The problem is that if 'now' is used it is evaluated at index time.
So the idea is to rewrite date ranges with 'now' to a match all query, 
so that the query analyzer can't extract it and the `percolate` query 
is  then able to evaluate 'now' at query time.
