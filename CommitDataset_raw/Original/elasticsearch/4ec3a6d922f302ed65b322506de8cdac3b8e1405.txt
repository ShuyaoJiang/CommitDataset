Ensure either success or failure path for SearchOperationListener is called (#37467)

Today we have several implementations of executing SearchOperationListener
in SearchService. While all of them seem to be safe at least on, the one that
executes scroll searches can cause illegal execution of SearchOperationListener
that can then in-turn trigger assertions in ShardSearchStats. This change
adds a SearchOperationListenerExecutor that uses try-with blocks to ensure
listeners are called in a safe way.
