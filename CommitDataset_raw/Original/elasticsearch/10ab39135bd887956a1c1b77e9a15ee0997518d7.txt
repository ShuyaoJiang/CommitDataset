SQL: Enhance checks for inexact fields (#39427)

For functions: move checks for `text` fields without underlying `keyword`
fields or with many of them (ambiguity) to the type resolution stage.

For Order By/Group By: move checks to the `Verifier` to catch early
before `QueryTranslator` or execution.

Closes: #38501
Fixes: #35203
