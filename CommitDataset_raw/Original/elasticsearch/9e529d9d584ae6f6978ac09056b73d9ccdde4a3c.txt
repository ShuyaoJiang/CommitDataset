Enable testing in FIPS140 JVM (#31666)

Ensure our tests can run in a FIPS JVM

JKS keystores cannot be used in a FIPS JVM as attempting to use one
in order to init a KeyManagerFactory or a TrustManagerFactory is not
allowed.( JKS keystore algorithms for private key encryption are not
FIPS 140 approved)
This commit replaces JKS keystores in our tests with the
corresponding PEM encoded key and certificates both for key and trust
configurations.
Whenever it's not possible to refactor the test, i.e. when we are
testing that we can load a JKS keystore, etc. we attempt to
mute the test when we are running in FIPS 140 JVM. Testing for the
JVM is naive and is based on the name of the security provider as
we would control the testing infrastrtucture and so this would be
reliable enough.
Other cases of tests being muted are the ones that involve custom
TrustStoreManagers or KeyStoreManagers, null TLS Ciphers and the
SAMLAuthneticator class as we cannot sign XML documents in the
way we were doing. SAMLAuthenticator tests in a FIPS JVM can be
reenabled with precomputed and signed SAML messages at a later stage.

IT will be covered in a subsequent PR
