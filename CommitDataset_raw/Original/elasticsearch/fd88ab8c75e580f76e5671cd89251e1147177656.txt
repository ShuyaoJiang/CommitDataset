Fixes shrink action to remove single ndoe allocation (#33091)

This change fixes the shrink action so when the shrink is performed we
remove the single node allocation fromt eh shard allocation filtering
settings. Without this fix replicas cannot be allocated after we have
performed the shrink and we cannot make progress with the rest of the
shink aciton.

This change also fixes a bug in the explain API where the maste node
timeout was being set to null if it wasn't provided instead of using
its default value causing a NPE
