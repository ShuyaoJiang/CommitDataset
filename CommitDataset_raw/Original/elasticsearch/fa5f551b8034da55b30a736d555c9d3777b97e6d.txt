[ILM] make alias swapping atomic (#35972)

In the current implementation, there is a time between the
ShrinkStep and the ShrinkSetAliasStep that both the source and
target indices will be present with the same aliases. This means
that queries to during this time will query both and return
duplicates. This fixes that scenario by moving the alias inheritance
to the same aliases update request as is done in ShrinkSetAliasStep
