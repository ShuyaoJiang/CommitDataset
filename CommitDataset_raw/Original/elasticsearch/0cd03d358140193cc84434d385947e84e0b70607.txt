Use RoleRetrievalResult for better caching (#34197)

Security caches the result of role lookups and negative lookups are
cached indefinitely. In the case of transient failures this leads to a
bad experience as the roles could truly exist. The CompositeRolesStore
needs to know if a failure occurred in one of the roles stores in order
to make the appropriate decision as it relates to caching. In order to
provide this information to the CompositeRolesStore, the return type of
methods to retrieve roles has changed to a new class,
RoleRetrievalResult. This class provides the ability to pass back an
exception to the roles store. This exception does not mean that a
request should be failed but instead serves as a signal to the roles
store that missing roles should not be cached and neither should the
combined role if there are missing roles.

As part of this, the negative lookup cache was also changed from an
unbounded cache to a cache with a configurable limit.
