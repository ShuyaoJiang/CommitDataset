Scripting: Deprecate index lookup (#24691)

This commit adds a deprecation warning if `_index` is used in scripts.
It is emitted each time a script is invoked, but not per document. There
is no test because constructing a LeafIndexLookup is quite difficult,
but the deprecation warning does show up in IndexLookupIT, there is just
no way to assert warnings in integ tests.
