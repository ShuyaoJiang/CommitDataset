Separate remote clusters docs from CCS (#34612)

With remote clusters taking on a larger role, we have make the
infrastructure more generic than being tied to cross-cluster search
(CCS). We want to refer to the remote clusters configuration in the
cross-cluster replication (CCR) docs. Yet, these docs are still tied to
CCS. This commit extracts the remote clusters docs from CCS (with some
wording changes to make them more general) so that we can refer to them
in the CCR docs.
