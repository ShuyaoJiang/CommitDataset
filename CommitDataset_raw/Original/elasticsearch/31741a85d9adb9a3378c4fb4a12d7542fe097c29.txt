[Monitoring] Add Shard-level Details to Index Stats Collection (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2817)

This adds details about the shards and the health of the index. By adding these stats directly to the document, the UI can avoid many aggregations and enable better searching and sorting against indices.
