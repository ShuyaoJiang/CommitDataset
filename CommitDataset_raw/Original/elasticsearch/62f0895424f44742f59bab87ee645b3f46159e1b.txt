Make the `type` parameter optional when percolating existing documents. (#39987)

`document_type` is the type to use for parsing the document to percolate, which
is already optional and deprecated. However `percotale` queries also have the
ability to percolate existing documents, identified by an index, an id and a
type. This change makes the latter optional and deprecated.
