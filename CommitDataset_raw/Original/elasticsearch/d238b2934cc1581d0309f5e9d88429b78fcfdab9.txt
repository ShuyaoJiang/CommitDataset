TEST: Fix Engine#testRebuildLocalCheckpointTracker

In this test, we verify that the LocalCheckpointTracker is initialized
with the operations of the safe commit. And the test fails because
Engine#Index does not implement the equals method (should not
implement as it consists of a mutable ParsedDocument).

Closes #36470
