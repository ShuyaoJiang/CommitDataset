Remove `index.mapping.single_type=false` from reindex tests (#25365)

* Remove the setting from the yml tests and replace with tests using
`join` field. We can't use the setting in yml tests without lots of
backflips but we have `ReindexParentChildTests` for the coverage.
There weren't tests for `join` field with reindex before this. Adding
these tests discovered #25363.
* Remove the setting from `ReindexParentChildTests` and replace with
`index.version.created=V_5_6_0`. This test can be entirely removed
when legacy parent/child support is dropped from core.
* Port the yml tests that set _parent into integ tests so they
can set the index created version. These tests can be removed
when we drop support for _parent in core.
* Port a delete-by-query test for filtering based on type to an
`ESIntegTestCase` so it can use `index.version.created=5.6.0` to
setup documents of multiple types. This whole feature can be dropped
when we no longer support multiple types per index.

Relates to #24961
