Tests: Ensure waiting time between stopping and starting watcher (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2008)

Otherwise we might run into race conditions that prevent a useful
start up again.

Those tests can be massively improved (no need to run against the real
master node), once the watcher BWC compatible stats are in.
