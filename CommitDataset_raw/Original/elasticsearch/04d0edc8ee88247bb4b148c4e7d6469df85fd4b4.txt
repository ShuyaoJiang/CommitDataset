Fix incorrect geohash for lat 90, lon 180 (#29256)

Due to special treatment for the 0xFFFFFF... value in GeoHashUtils'
encodeLatLon method, the hashcode for lat 90, lon 180 is incorrectly
encoded as `"000000000000"` instead of "zzzzzzzzzzzz". This commit
removes the special treatment and fixes the issue.

Closes #22163
