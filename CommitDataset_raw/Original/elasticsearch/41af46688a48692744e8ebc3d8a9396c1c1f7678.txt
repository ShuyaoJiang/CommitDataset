Make PKI BootstrapCheck work with SecureSettings (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3993)

SslConfiguration can depend on SecureSettings, so it must be
constructed during the correct lifecycle phase.
For PkiRealmBootstrapCheck, moved the construction of SslConfiguration
objets into the constructor rather than the check method
