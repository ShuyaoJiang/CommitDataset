Add a soft limit for the number of requested doc-value fields (#26574)

Requesting to many docvalue_fields in a search request can potentially be costly
because it might incur a per-field per-document seek. This change introduces a
soft limit on the number of fields that can be retrieved. The setting can be
changed per index using the `index.max_docvalue_fields_search` setting.
