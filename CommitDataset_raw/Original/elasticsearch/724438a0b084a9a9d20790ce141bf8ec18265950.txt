[Security] Check auth scheme case insensitively (#31490)

According to RFC 7617, the Basic authentication scheme name
should not be case sensitive.
Case insensitive comparisons are also applicable for the bearer
tokens where Bearer authentication scheme is used as per
RFC 6750 and RFC 7235

Some Http clients may send authentication scheme names in
different case types for eg. Basic, basic, BASIC, BEARER etc.,
so the lack of case-insensitive check is an issue when these
clients try to authenticate with elasticsearch.

This commit adds case-insensitive checks for Basic and Bearer
authentication schemes.

Closes #31486
