Use fixture to test the repository-gcs plugin (#28788)

This commit adds a GoogleCloudStorageFixture that uses the
logic of a GoogleCloudStorageTestServer (added in #28576)
to emulate a remote Google Cloud Storage service.

By adding this fixture and a more complete integration test, we 
should be able to catch more bugs when upgrading the client library.

The fixture is started by the googleCloudStorageFixture task
and a custom Service Account file is created and added to the
Elasticsearch keystore for each test.
