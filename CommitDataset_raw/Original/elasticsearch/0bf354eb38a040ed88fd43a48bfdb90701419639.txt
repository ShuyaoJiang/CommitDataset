Watcher: Fix hipchat message failure serialization (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3939)

The current toXContent serialization of a failed hipchat message writes
the same field called status twice and thus cannot be stored in the
watch history.

This commit ensures the field gets only written once.
