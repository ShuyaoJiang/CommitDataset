Fix content type detection with leading whitespace (#32632)

Today content type detection on an input stream works by peeking up to
twenty bytes into the stream. If the stream is headed by more whitespace
than twenty bytes, we might fail to detect the content type. We should
be ignoring this whitespace before attempting to detect the content
type. This commit does that by ignoring all leading whitespace in an
input stream before attempting to guess the content type.
