Remove useless version checks in REST tests. (#30165)

Many tests are added with a version check so that they do not run against a
version that doesn't have the feature yet. Master is 7.0, so all tests that
do not run against 6.0+ can be removed and the version check can be removed
on all tests that always run on 6.0+.
