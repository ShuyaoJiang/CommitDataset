Decouple `ChannelFactory` from Tcp classes (#27286)

* Decouple `ChannelFactory` from Tcp classes

This is related to #27260. Currently `ChannelFactory` is tightly coupled
to classes related to the elasticsearch Tcp binary protocol. This commit
modifies the factory to be able to construct http or other protocol
channels.
