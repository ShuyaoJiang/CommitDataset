Checks the circuit breaker before allocating bytes for a new big array (#25010)

Previously, when allocating bytes for a BigArray, the array was created
(or attempted to be created) and only then would the array be checked
for the amount of RAM used to see if the circuit breaker should trip.

This is problematic because for very large arrays, if creating or
resizing the array, it is possible to attempt to create/resize and get
an OOM error before the circuit breaker trips, because the allocation
happens before checking with the circuit breaker.

This commit ensures that the circuit breaker is checked before all big
array allocations (note, this does not effect the array allocations that
are less than 16kb which use the [Type]ArrayWrapper classes found in
BigArrays.java).  If such an allocation or resizing would cause the
circuit breaker to trip, then the breaker trips before attempting to
allocate and potentially running into an OOM error from the JVM.

Closes #24790
