This implementation lazily (on 1st forecast request) checks for available
diskspace and creates a subfolder for storing data outside of Lucene
indexes, but as part of the ES data paths.

Details:
 - tmp storage is managed and does not allow allocation if disk space is
   below a threshold (5GB at the moment)
 - tmp storage is supposed to be managed by the native component but in
   case this fails cleanup is provided:
    - on job close
    - on process crash
    - after node crash, on restart
 - available space is re-checked for every forecast call (the native
   component has to check again before writing)

Note: The 1st path that has enough space is chosen on job open (job
close/reopen triggers a new search)
