Enforce retention leases require soft deletes (#39922)

If a primary on 6.7 and a replica on 5.6 are running more than 5 minutes
(retention leases background sync interval), the retention leases
background sync will be triggered, and it will trip 6.7 node due to the
illegal checkpoint value. We can fix the problem by making the returned
checkpoint depends on the node version. This PR, however, chooses to
enforce retention leases require soft deletes, and make retention leases
sync noop if soft deletes is disabled instead.

Closes #39914
