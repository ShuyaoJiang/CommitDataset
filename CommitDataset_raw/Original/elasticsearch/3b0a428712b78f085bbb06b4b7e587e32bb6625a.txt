Use ephemeral ports in Wildfly tests

The Wildfly tests previously needed hardcoded ports which would
sometimes already be in use leading to Wildfly test failures because the
server could not bind during startup. We had to wait until some upstream
changes (wildfly/wildfly#9943) and (wildfly/wildfly-core#2390) were
released before we could use ephemeral ports in these tests. These
changes are released now so this commit changes the Wildfly tests to use
ephemeral ports when starting Wildfly.
