Reject multiple methods in `percentiles` aggregation (#26163)

Currently the `percentiles` aggregation allows specifying both possible methods
in the query DSL, but only the later one is used. This changes it to rejecting
such requests with an error. Setting the method multiple times via the java API
still works (and the last one wins).
