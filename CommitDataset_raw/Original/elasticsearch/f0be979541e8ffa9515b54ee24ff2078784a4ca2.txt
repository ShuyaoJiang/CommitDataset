SQL: Mimick Elasticsearch defaults for sql action (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4398)

The SQL action supports several text outputs and used to default to an
output that looked like the SQL CLI. It is a lovely output format but
this changes output selection behavior to mimick Elasticsearch's
standard behavior: it'll now default to the same format as the request.

That means that if you want the pretty text format then you need to ask
for it. The way to do that is:

```
POST /_xpack/sql?format=text/plain
{
    "query": "SELECT * FROM library ORDER BY page_count DESC LIMIT 5"
}
```
