[HLRC] Support for role mapper expression dsl (#33745)

This commit adds support for role mapping expression dsl.
Functionally it is similar to what we have on the server side
except for the rule evaluation which is not required on the client.

The role mapper expression can either be field expression or
composite expression of one or more expressions. Role mapper
expression parser is used to parse JSON DSL to list of expressions.

This forms the base for role mapping APIs (get, post/put and delete)
