Skip reindex tests from old es if we can't run it

Two of the versions of Elasticsearch we need to run for these tests
can't run in Java 9 so we skip the entire test if we are running in
java 9. For now. I'd like to reenable it to run against java 8 if
there is one available, but that can wait for another time.
