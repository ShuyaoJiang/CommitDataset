Advance max_seq_no before add operation to Lucene (#38879)

Today when processing an operation on a replica engine (or the 
following engine), we first add it to Lucene, then add it to translog, 
then finally marks its seq_no as completed. If a flush occurs after step1,
but before step-3, the max_seq_no in the commit's user_data will be
smaller than the seq_no of some documents in the Lucene commit.
