Core: Less settings to AbstractComponent (#35140)

Stop passing `Settings` to `AbstractComponent`'s ctor. This allows us to
stop passing around `Settings` in a *ton* of places. While this change
touches many files, it touches them all in fairly small, mechanical
ways, doing a few things per file:
1. Drop the `super(settings);` line on everything that extends
`AbstractComponent`.
2. Drop the `settings` argument to the ctor if it is no longer used.
3. If the file doesn't use `logger` then drop `extends
AbstractComponent` from it.
4. Clean up all compilation failure caused by the `settings` removal
and drop any now unused `settings` isntances and method arguments.

I've intentionally *not* removed the `settings` argument from a few
files:
1. TransportAction
2. AbstractLifecycleComponent
3. BaseRestHandler

These files don't *need* `settings` either, but this change is large
enough as is.
