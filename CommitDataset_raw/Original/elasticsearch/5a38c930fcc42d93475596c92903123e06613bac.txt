Add license checks for auto-follow implementation (#33496)

This commit adds license checks for the auto-follow implementation. We
check the license on put auto-follow patterns, and then for every
coordination round we check that the local and remote clusters are
licensed for CCR. In the case of non-compliance, we skip coordination
yet continue to schedule follow-ups.
