Allow efficient can_match phases on frozen indices (#35431)

This change adds a special caching reader that caches all relevant
values for a range query to rewrite correctly in a can_match phase
without actually opening the underlying directory reader. This
allows frozen indices to be filtered with can_match and in-turn
searched with wildcards in a efficient way since it allows us to
exclude shards that won't match based on their date-ranges without
opening their directory readers.
