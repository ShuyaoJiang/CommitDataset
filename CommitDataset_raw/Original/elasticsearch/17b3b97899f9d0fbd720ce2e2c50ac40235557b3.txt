Fixed CCR stats api serialization issues and (#33983)

always use `IndicesOptions.strictExpand()` for indices options.

The follow index may be closed and we still want to get stats from
shard follow task and the whether the provided index name matches with
follow index name is checked when locating the task itself in the ccr
stats transport action.
