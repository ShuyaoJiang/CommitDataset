[Rollup] Add more diagnostic stats to job (#35471)

* [Rollup] Add more diagnostic stats to job

To help debug future performance issues, this adds the
 min/max/avg/count/total latencies (in milliseconds) for search
and bulk phase.  This latency is the total service time including
transfer between nodes, not just the `took` time.

It also adds the count of search/bulk failures encountered during
runtime.  This information is also in the log, but a runtime counter
will help expose problems faster

* review cleanup

* Remove dead ParseFields
