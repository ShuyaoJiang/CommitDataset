Test: fix race in auth result propagation test

This commit fixes a race condition in a test introduced by #36900 that
verifies concurrent authentications get a result propagated from the
first thread that attempts to authenticate. Previously, a thread may
be in a state where it had not attempted to authenticate when the first
thread that authenticates finishes the authentication, which would
cause the test to fail as there would be an additional authentication
attempt. This change adds additional latches to ensure all threads have
attempted to authenticate before a result gets returned in the
thread that is performing authentication.
