Introduce FollowersChecker (#33917)

It is important that the leader periodically checks that its followers are
still healthy and can remain part of its cluster. If these checks fail
repeatedly then the leader should remove the faulty node from the cluster. The
FollowerChecker, introduced in this commit, performs these periodic checks and
deals with retries.
