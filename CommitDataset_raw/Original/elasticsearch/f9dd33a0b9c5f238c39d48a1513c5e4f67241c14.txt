[Rollup] Proactively resolve index patterns in RollupSearch endoint (#34930)

This changes the RollupSearch endpoint to proactively resolve index
patterns.  If the index pattern(s) match more than one rollup index,
an exception is throw as before.  But if the pattern only matches one
rollup index, execution is allowed to continue (unlike before where
it would assume all patterns were for raw data).

This also allows the search endpoint to resolve aliases that point to
a rollup index.

Also tweaks the documentation to make this clear.

Closes #34828
