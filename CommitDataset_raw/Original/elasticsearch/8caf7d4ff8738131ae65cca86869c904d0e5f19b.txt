Decouple BulkProcessor from ThreadPool (#26727)

Introduce minimal thread scheduler as a base class for `ThreadPool`. Such a class can be used from the `BulkProcessor` to schedule retries and the flush task. This allows to remove the `ThreadPool` dependency from `BulkProcessor`, which requires to provide settings that contain `node.name` and also needed log4j for logging. Instead, it needs now a `Scheduler` that is much lighter and gets automatically created and shut down on close.
