Do not swallow exception in ChecksumBlobStoreFormat.writeAtomic() (#27597)

The ChecksumBlobStoreFormat.writeAtomic() method writes a blob using a
temporary name and then moves the blob to its final name. The move
operation can fail and in this case the temporary blob is deleted. If
this delete operation also fails, then the initial exception is lost.

This commit ensures that when something goes wrong during the move
operation the initial exception is kept and thrown, and if the delete
operation also fails then this additional exception is added
as a suppressed exception to the initial one.
