[ML] Allow overrides for some file structure detection decisions (#33630)

This change modifies the file structure detection functionality
such that some of the decisions can be overridden with user
supplied values.

The fields that can be overridden are:

- charset
- format
- has_header_row
- column_names
- delimiter
- quote
- should_trim_fields
- grok_pattern
- timestamp_field
- timestamp_format

If an override makes finding the file structure impossible then
the endpoint will return an exception.
