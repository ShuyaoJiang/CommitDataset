Migrate some *ResponseTests to AbstractStreamableXContentTestCase (#28749)

This allows us to save a bit of code, but also adds more coverage as it tests serialization which was missing in some of the existing tests. Also it requires implementing equals/hashcode and we get the corresponding tests for them for free from the base test class.
