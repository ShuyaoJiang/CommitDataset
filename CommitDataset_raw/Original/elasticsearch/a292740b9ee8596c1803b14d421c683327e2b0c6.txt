Add cgroup memory usage/limit to OS stats on Linux (#26166)

This change adds cgroup memory usage/limit to the OS stats section of
the node stats on Linux.  This information is useful because in Docker
containers the standard node stats report the host memory limit, not
taking account of extra restrictions that may have been applied to the
container.

The original idea was to store these values as Long, truncating any values
outside the range of long.  However, this meant that in the relatively common
case of no limit being applied, users would not see the same value in the OS
stats as they see by querying Linux directly.  So instead the values are stored
as String.  This change places a burden on consumers of the strings to
convert the strings to numbers and decide what to do about extremely large
values, but there will be very few consumers and they would need to have a
policy for dealing with "no limit" in any case.
