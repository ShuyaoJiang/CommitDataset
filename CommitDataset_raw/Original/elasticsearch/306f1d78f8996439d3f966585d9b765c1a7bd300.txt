[CCR] Retry when no index shard stats can be found (#34852)

Index shard stats for the follower shard are fetched, when a shard follow task is started.
This is needed in order to bootstap the shard follow task with the follower global checkpoint.

Sometimes index shard stats are not available (e.g. during a restart) and
we fail now, while it is very likely that these stats will be available some time later.
