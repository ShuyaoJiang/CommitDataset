Introduce PreVoteCollector (#32847)

An election requires a node to select a term that is higher than all
previously-seen terms.  If nodes are too enthusiastic about starting elections
then they can effectively excludes itself from the cluster until the leader can
bump to a still-higher term, and if this process repeats then a single faulty
node can prevent the cluster from making useful progress.

The solution is to start the election with a pre-voting round to ensure that
there is at least a quorum of nodes who believe there to be no leader.

This also fixes up some merge issues.
