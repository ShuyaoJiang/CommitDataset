Add exception handling for write listeners (#27590)

This potential issue was exposed when I saw this PR #27542. Essentially
we currently execute the write listeners all over the place without
consistently catching and handling exceptions. Some of these exceptions
will be logged in different ways (including as low as `debug`).

This commit adds a single location where these listeners are executed.
If the listener throws an execption, the exception is caught and logged
at the `warn` level.
