[ILM] fix retry so it picks up latest policy and executes async action (#35406)

Before, moving to a failed step would only change the step info
to be that of the failed step. This means two things.

1. Async Steps would never be triggered to execute
2. If there are inherent problems with the action definition that can
be fixed with a policy update, these changes were not being reflected
by the new execution info.

Changes now

1. Async steps are executed after the move to the failed step in cluster state
2. the lifecycle execution info's phase definition is updated from the current
latest policy definition, even though the index isn't moving to a new phase.

Closes #35397.
