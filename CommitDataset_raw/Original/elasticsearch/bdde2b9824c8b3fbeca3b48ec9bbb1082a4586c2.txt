Rename request variables in shrink/split handlers (#30207)

This is a code-tidying PR, a little side adventure while working on
another change. Previously only shrink request existed but when the
ability to split indices was added, shrink and split were done together
under a single request object: the resize request object. However, the
code inherited the legacy name in the naming of some variables. This
commit cleans this up.
