ignore 409 conflict in reindex responses (#39543)

The reindex family of APIs (reindex, update-by-query, delete-by-query) can
sometimes return responses that have an error status code (409 Conflict in this
case) but still have a body in the usual BulkByScrollResponse format. When the
HLRC tries to handle such responses, it blows up because it tris to parse it
expecting the error format that errors in general use. This change prompts the
HLRC to parse the response using the expected BulkByScrollResponse format.
