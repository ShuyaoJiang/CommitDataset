Support merge nested Map in list for JIRA configurations (#37634)

This commit allows JIRA API fields that require a list of key/value 
pairs (maps), such as JIRA "components" to use use template snippets 
(e.g. {{ctx.payload.foo}}). Prior to this change the templated value 
(not the de-referenced value) would be sent via the API and error. 

Closes #30068
