Roll translog generation on primary promotion

When a primary is promoted, rolling the translog generation here makes
simpler reasoning about the relationship between primary terms and
translog generation. Note that this is not strictly necessary for
correctness (e.g., to avoid duplicate operations with the same sequence
number within a single generation).
