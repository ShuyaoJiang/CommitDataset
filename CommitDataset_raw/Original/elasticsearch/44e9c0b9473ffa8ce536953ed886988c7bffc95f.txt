Upgrade to lucene-7.0.0-snapshot-ad2cb77. (#25349)

Most notable changes:
 - better update concurrency: LUCENE-7868
 - TopDocs.totalHits is now a long: LUCENE-7872
 - QueryBuilder does not remove the boolean query around multi-term synonyms:
   LUCENE-7878
 - removal of Fields: LUCENE-7500

For the `TopDocs.totalHits` change, this PR relies on the fact that the encoding
of vInts and vLongs are compatible: you can write and read with any of them as
long as the value can be represented by a positive int.
