Fix bug in BucketMetrics path traversal (#30632)

When processing a top-level sibling pipeline, we destructively sublist
the path by assigning back onto the same variable.  But if aggs are
specified such:

A. Multi-bucket agg in the first entry of our internal list
B. Regular agg as the immediate child of the multi-bucket in A
C. Regular agg with the same name as B at the top level, listed as the
   second entry in our internal list
D. Finally, a pipeline agg with the path down to B

We'll get class cast exception.  The first agg will sublist the path
from [A,B] to [B], and then when we loop around to check agg C,
the sublisted path [B] matches the name of C and it fails.

The fix is simple: we just need to store the sublist in a new object
so that the old path remains valid for the rest of the aggs in the loop
