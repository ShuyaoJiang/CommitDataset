Aggregations/HL Rest client fix: missing scores (#32774)

Significance score doubles were being parsed as long. Existing tests did not catch this because SignificantLongTermsTests and SignificantStringTermsTests did not set the score. Fixed these and also added integration test.

Thanks for the report/fix, Blakko
