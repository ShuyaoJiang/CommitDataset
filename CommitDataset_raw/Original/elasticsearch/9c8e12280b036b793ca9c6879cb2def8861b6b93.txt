Test: increase the wait for green cluster health calls (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1703)

This commit increases the amount of time to wait for green cluster health during a rolling upgrade
to account for the time that may be needed in the case of delayed shards. Additionally some old
timeout values were removed as they were used due to the default timeout of 30s.
