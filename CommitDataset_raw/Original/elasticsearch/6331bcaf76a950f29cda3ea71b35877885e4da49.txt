Create keystore on package install (#28928)

This commit removes the ability to specify that a plugin requires the
keystore and instead creates the keystore on package installation or
when Elasticsearch is started for the first time. The reason that we opt
to create the keystore on package installation is to ensure that the
keystore has the correct permissions (the package installation scripts
run as root as opposed to Elasticsearch running as the elasticsearch
user) and to enable removing the keystore on package removal if the
keystore is not modified.
