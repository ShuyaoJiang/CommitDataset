[ML] Update ML results mappings on process start (#37706)

This change moves the update to the results index mappings
from the open job action to the code that starts the
autodetect process.

When a rolling upgrade is performed we need to update the
mappings for already-open jobs that are reassigned from an
old version node to a new version node, but the open job
action is not called in this case.

Closes #37607
