Sense for VirtualBox and $HOME when deciding to turn on vagrant testing. (#24636)

We're using Vagrant in more places now than before. This commit includes a plugin that verifies
the Vagrant and Virtualbox installations for projects that depend on them. This shared code
should fix up the errors we've seen from CI builds relating to the new Kerberos fixture.
