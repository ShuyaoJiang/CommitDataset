Fix problem with MatchNoDocsQuery in disjunction queries (#35726)

Queries across multiple fields generate MatchNoDocsQuerys for fields that are
unmapped. In certain situation this can lead to erroneous behaviour,
for example when an umapped field is used in a query_string query across
several fields. If some of the tokens in the query string get eliminated by an
analyzer on the mapped fields, the same token will currently generate
MatchNoDocsQuerys combined into a disjunction, which in turn
leads to no matches in the overall query. Instead we should simply not add
MatchNoDocsQuerys to those disjunctions.
