Adds `index.lifecycle.step_info` setting and uses it on ERROR and incomplete steps (#30465)

* Adds `index.lifecycle.step_info` setting and uses it on ERROR

This change make a new `index.lifecycle.step_info` setting which can be
used to store a JSON blob of containing context about the current step.
It then adds code so that when we move to the error step we serialise
the exception to JSON  and store it in this setting so the user can get
information on why the step failed.

* Adds step information for AsyncWaitSteps

The Listener for AsyncWaitStep now takes a ToXContentObject which
represents information about the status of the condition if it has not
completed. This object is then serialised to a JSON string and stored
in the `index.lifecycle.step_info` index setting. This information is
only stored if the step is not complete. If the step is complete the
step info is ignored sice we will move straight to the next step where
the info is no longer relevant.

Changes for the `ClusterStateWaitStep` will be very similar but will be
made in a following commit after this approach has been agreed. I do
not intend to have information for `AsyncActionStep` to have the
ability to set step info since actions should either be done or not
done and if they error they should transition to the ERROR step.

* Clear step info when transitioning to next step
