[ML] Consistent pattern for strict/lenient parser names (#32399)

Previously we had two patterns for naming of strict
and lenient parsers.

Some classes had CONFIG_PARSER and METADATA_PARSER,
and used an enum to pass the parser type to nested
parsers.

Other classes had STRICT_PARSER and LENIENT_PARSER
and used ternary operators to pass the parser type
to nested parsers.

This change makes all ML classes use the second of
the patterns described above.
