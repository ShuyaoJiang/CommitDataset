Reduce flaxiness of ccr recovery timeouts test (#38035)

This fixes #38027. Currently we assert that all shards have failed.
However, it is possible that some shards do not have segement files
created yet. The action that we block is fetching these segement files
so it is possible that some shards successfully recover.

This commit changes the assertion to ensure that at least some of the
shards have failed.
