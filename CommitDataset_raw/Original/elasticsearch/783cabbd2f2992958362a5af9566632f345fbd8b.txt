[DOCS] Reflect recent improvements in notes on watch/datafeed privileges (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4116)

Following elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3254 security for ML datafeeds has been improved.  The same goes
for watches since elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2808.

This change updates a section of the docs that was missed in those changes.
(The majority of the docs changes were made at the appropriate time.)
