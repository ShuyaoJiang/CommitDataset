Tests: Replace YAML test waiting for watch execution (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4008)

This is the last YAML test, that waits for a watch execution by
specifying some timeout value. This one also gets replaced with a java
test that uses `assertBusy()` and thus is much more likely to succeed.

relates elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1513
