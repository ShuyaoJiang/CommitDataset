Fix serialization of the `_all` field. (#26143)

By default we only serialize analyzers if the index analyzer is not the
`default` analyzer or if the `search_analyzer` is different from the index
`analyzer`. This raises issues with the `_all` field when the
`index.analysis.analyzer.default_search` is set, since it automatically makes
the `search_analyzer` different from the index `analyzer`. Then there are
exceptions since we expect the `_all` configuration to be empty on 6.0 indices.

Closes #26136
