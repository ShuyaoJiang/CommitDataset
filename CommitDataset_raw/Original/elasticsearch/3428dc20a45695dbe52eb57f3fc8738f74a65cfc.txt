Improve release notes script (#31833)

Improve release notes script

The current release notes script does not handle area labels that
are not two parts, such as ":ml".  As these area labels are rare,
I have simply hard-coded a title for these area labels.  In
addition, the script will not explicitly call out instances where
multiple area labels are present on an issue.
