[ML] Handle requests with source (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1553)

REST endpoints that support GET and POST need
to also support source parsing. As these
endpoints can accept a body but some clients
do not allow doing a GET with a request body,
elasticsearch has support for parsing via a
source URI parameter. This commit adds source
handling to all such endpoints.
