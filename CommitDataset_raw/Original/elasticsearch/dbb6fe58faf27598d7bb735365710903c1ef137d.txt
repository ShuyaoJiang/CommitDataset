Remove hand-coded XContent duplicate checks

With this commit we cleanup hand-coded duplicate checks in XContent
parsing. They were necessary previously but since we reconfigured the
underlying parser in #22073 and #22225, these checks are obsolete and
were also ineffective unless an undocumented system property has been
set. As we also remove this escape hatch, we can remove the additional
checks as well.

Closes #22253
Relates #34588
