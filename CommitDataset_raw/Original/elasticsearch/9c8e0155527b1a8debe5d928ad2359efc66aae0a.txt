Build: Mostly silence warning about html4 javadoc (#30220)

This *mostly* silences `javadoc`'s warning about defaulting to
generating html4 files by enabling generating html5 file for the
projects for which that works. It didn't work in a half dozen projects,
about half of which I've fixed in this PR, entirely by replacing
`<tt>thing</tt>` with `{@code thing}`.

There are a few remaining projects that contain javadoc with invalid
html5. I'll fix those projects in a followup.
