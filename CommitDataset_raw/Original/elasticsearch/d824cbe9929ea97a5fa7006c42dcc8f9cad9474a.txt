Test: ensure char[] doesn't being with prefix (#34816)

The testCharsBeginsWith test has a check that a random prefix of length
2 is not the prefix of a char[]. However, there is no check that the
char[] is not randomly generated with the same two characters as the
prefix. This change ensures that the char[] does not begin with the
prefix.
