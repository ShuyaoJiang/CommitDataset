Add test for `PutFollowAction` on a closed index (#38236)

This is related to #35975. Currently when an index falls behind a leader
it encounters a fatal exception. This commit adds a test for that
scenario. Additionally, it tests that the user can stop following, close
the follower index, and put follow again. After the indexing is
re-bootstrapped, it will recover the documents it lost in normal
following operations.
