Switch security spi example to new style Requests (#32341)

In #29623 we added `Request` object flavored requests to the low level
REST client and in #30315 we deprecated the old `performRequest`s. This
changes all calls in the `x-pack/qa/security-example-spi-extension`
project to use the new versions.
