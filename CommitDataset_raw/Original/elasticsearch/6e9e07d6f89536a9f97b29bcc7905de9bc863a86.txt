Fix profiling naming issues (#27133)

Some code-paths use anonymous classes (such as NonCollectingAggregator
in terms agg), which messes up the display name of the profiler.  If
we encounter an anonymous class, we need to grab the super's name.

Another naming issue was that ProfileAggs were not delegating to the
wrapped agg's name for toString(), leading to ugly display.

This PR also fixes up the profile documentation.  Some of the examples were
executing against empty indices, which shows different profile results
than a populated index (and made for confusing examples).

Finally, I switched the agg display names from the fully qualified name
to the simple name, so that it's similar to how the query profiles work.

Closes #26405
