Added support to the percolate query to percolate multiple documents

The percolator will add a `_percolator_document_slot` field to all percolator
hits to indicate with what document it has matched. This number matches with
the order in which the documents have been specified in the percolate query.

Also improved the support for multiple percolate queries in a search request.
