Tests: Add rolling upgrade tests for watcher (#32428)

These tests ensure, that the basic watch APIs are tested in the rolling
upgrade tests. After initially adding a watch, the tests try to get,
execute, deactivate and activate a watch. Watcher stats are tested as
well, and an own java based test has been added for restarting, as that
requires waiting for a state change. Watcher history is also checked.
