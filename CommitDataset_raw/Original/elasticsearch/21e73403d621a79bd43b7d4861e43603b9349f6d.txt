Mute full cluster restart test recovery test

This test is failing because of an addition of a call to GET
/_cluster/health with the parameter wait_for_no_initializing_shards set
to true. As older versions of Elasticsearch do not understand this
parameter, this request fails and the test fails. This commit marks this
test as awaiting a fix.
