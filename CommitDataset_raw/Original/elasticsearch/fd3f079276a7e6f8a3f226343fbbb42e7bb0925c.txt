[ML] Exclude failed jobs from node allocation decision (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4395)

When calculating the current load on each ML node during the
node allocation process we should be ignoring failed jobs.
This is because failed jobs do not have a corresponding native
process, so do not consume memory or CPU resources.
