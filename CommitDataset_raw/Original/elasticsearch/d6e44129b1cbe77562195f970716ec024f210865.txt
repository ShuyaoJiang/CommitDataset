TEST: Only check max_seq_no_of_updates when rollback (#35170)

Currently, we assume that rollback always happens in the test
testRestoreLocalHistoryFromTranslogOnPromotion. However, if the global
checkpoint equals max_seq_no, we won't rollback. This causes the
max_seq_no_of_updates assertion failed because max_seq_no_of_updates
won't be advanced to the global checkpoint. With this commit, we assert
max_seq_no_of_updates in two different paths.
