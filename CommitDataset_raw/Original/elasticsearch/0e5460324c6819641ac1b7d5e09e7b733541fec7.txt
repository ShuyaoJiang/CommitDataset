Removed static indices and repos and the scripts that create them.

Two tests were still using the static indices:
* IndexFolderUpgraderTests#testUpgradeRealIndex()
* InternalEngineTests#testUpgradeOldIndex()

I removed these tests too, because these tests functionally overlap
with the full-cluster-restart qa tests.

Relates to #24939
