Wait for Netty threads after Security tests (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4390)

This commit adds waits for two Netty threads that run in the background
and require explicit calls to await inactivity in them. This shows up
as an issue in security tests since we always use netty and do not have
these waits so these threads can trip the thread leak detector.
