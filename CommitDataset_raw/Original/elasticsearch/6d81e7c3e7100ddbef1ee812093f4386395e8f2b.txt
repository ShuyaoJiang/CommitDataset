[CCR] FollowingEngine should fail with 403 if operation has no seqno assigned (#37213)

Fail with a 403 when indexing a document directly into a follower index.

In order to test this change, I had to move specific assertions into a dedicated class and
disable assertions for that class in the rest qa module. I think that is the right trade off.
