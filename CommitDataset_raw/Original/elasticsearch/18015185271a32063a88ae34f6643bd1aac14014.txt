[CCR] Refactor stats APIs (#34912)

* Changed the auto follow stats to also include follow stats.
* Renamed the auto follow stats api to stats api and changed its url path
  from `/_ccr/auto_follow/stats` `/_ccr/stats`.
* Removed `/_ccr/stats` url path for the follow stats api, which makes
  the index parameter a required parameter.
* Fixed docs.
