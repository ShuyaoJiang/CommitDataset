Limit the number of concurrent shard requests per search request (#25632)

This is a protection mechanism to prevent a single search request from
hitting a large number of shards in the cluster concurrently. If a search is
executed against all indices in the cluster this can easily overload the cluster
causing rejections etc. which is not necessarily desirable. Instead this PR adds
a per request limit of `max_concurrent_shard_requests` that throttles the number of
concurrent initial phase requests to `256` by default. This limit can be increased per request
and protects single search requests from overloading the cluster. Subsequent PRs can introduces
addiontional improvemetns ie. limiting this on a `_msearch` level, making defaults a factor of
the number of nodes or sort shards iters such that we gain the best concurrency across nodes.
