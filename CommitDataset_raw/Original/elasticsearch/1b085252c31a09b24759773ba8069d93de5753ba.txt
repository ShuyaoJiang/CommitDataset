[Painless] Add instance bindings (#34410)

This change adds instance bindings to Painless. This binding allows a whitelisted
 method to be called on an instance instantiated prior to script compilation. 
Whitelisting must be done in code as there is no practical way to instantiate a 
useful instance from a text file (see the tests for an example). Since an 
instance can be shared by multiple scripts, each method called must be 
thread-safe.
