Move compression config to ConnectionProfile (#35357)

This is related to #34483. It introduces a namespaced setting for
compression that allows users to configure compression on a per remote
cluster basis. The transport.tcp.compress remains as a fallback
setting. If transport.tcp.compress is set to true, then all requests
and responses are compressed. If it is set to false, only requests to
clusters based on the cluster.remote.cluster_name.transport.compress
setting are compressed. However, after this change regardless of any
local settings, responses will be compressed if the request that is
received was compressed.
