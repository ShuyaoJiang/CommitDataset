Client: Deprecate many argument performRequest (#30315)

Deprecate the many arguments versions of `performRequest` and
`performRequestAsync` in favor of the `Request` object flavored variants
introduced in #29623. We'll be dropping the many arguments variants in
7.0 because they make it difficult to add new features in a backwards
compatible way and they create a *ton* of intellisense noise.
