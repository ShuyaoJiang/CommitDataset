SQL: Move internals from TimeZone to ZoneId (#36651)

As the internals have moved to java.time, the usage of TimeZone itself
 should be minimized as it creates issues when being converted to ZoneId
Protocol wise the two are mostly identical so consumer should not see
 any difference.
Note that terminology wise, inside the docs, the public API and inside
 the protocol timeZone will continue to be used as it's more widely
 understood as oppose to zoneId which is an implementation detail
 specific to the JVM
