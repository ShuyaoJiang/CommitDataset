[ML] Reject put datafeed for job that is marked as deleted (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1537)

Deleting a job issues 2 cluster state updates.
The first marks the job as deleted.
The second actually removes the job.
Both check that there is no datafeed referring to the job.
If a put datafeed request arrives between those 2 cluster
state updates, the datafeed gets created and the final
job cluster state update fails. This means we end up with
both the job and the datafeed, but the job's results and
state have been deleted.

This commit changes the behaviour so that the put
datafeed request fails for a job that is marked as deleted
as this scenario is avoiding partially executing an action.
