Speed up sorted scroll when the index sort matches the search sort (#25138)

Sorted scroll search can use early termination when the index sort matches the scroll search sort.
The optimization can be done after the first query (which still needs to collect all documents)
by applying a query that only matches documents that are greater than the last doc retrieved in the previous request.
Since the index is sorted, retrieving the list of documents that are greater than the last doc
only requires a binary search on each segment.
This change introduces this new query called `SortedSearchAfterDocQuery` and apply it when possible.
Scrolls with this optimization will search all documents on the first request and then will early terminate each segment
after $size doc for any subsequent requests.
