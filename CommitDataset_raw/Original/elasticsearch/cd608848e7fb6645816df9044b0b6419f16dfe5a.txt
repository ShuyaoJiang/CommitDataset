Remove deprecated QUERY_AND_FETCH SearchType (#37257)

This SearchType was deprecated since at least 6.0 and according to the
documentation is only kept around for pre-5.3 requests. Removing and leaving a
comment as placeholder so we don't reuse the byte value associated with it
without further consideration.
