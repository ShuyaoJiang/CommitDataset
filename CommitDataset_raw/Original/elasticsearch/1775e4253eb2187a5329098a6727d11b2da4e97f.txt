Introducing a translog deletion policy (#24950)

Currently, the decisions regarding which translog generation files to delete are hard coded in the interaction between the `InternalEngine` and the `Translog` classes. This PR extracts it to a dedicated class called `TranslogDeletionPolicy`, for two main reasons:

1) Simplicity - the code is easier to read and understand (no more two phase commit on the translog, the Engine can just commit and the translog will respond)
2) Preparing for future plans to extend the logic we need - i.e., retain multiple lucene commit and also introduce a size based retention logic, allowing people to always keep a certain amount of translog files around. The latter is useful to increase the chance of an ops based recovery.
