Create skeleton for plugin split (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3233)

This creates a basic skeleton for the plugin split by adding folders and example
`build.gradle` files. It also includes a non-implemented `migrate-plugins.sh`
script that we can fill in at a later time.

Relates to elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2925
