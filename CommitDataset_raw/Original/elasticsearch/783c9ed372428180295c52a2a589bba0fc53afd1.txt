SQL: Allow sorting of groups by aggregates (#38042)

Introduce client-side sorting of groups based on aggregate
functions. To allow this, the Analyzer has been extended to push down
to underlying Aggregate, aggregate function and the Querier has been
extended to identify the case and consume the results in order and sort
them based on the given columns.
The underlying QueryContainer has been slightly modified to allow a view
of the underlying values being extracted as the columns used for sorting
might not be requested by the user.

The PR also adds minor tweaks, mainly related to tree output.
