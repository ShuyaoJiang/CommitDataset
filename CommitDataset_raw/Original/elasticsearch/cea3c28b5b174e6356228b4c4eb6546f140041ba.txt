[Tests] Fix alias names in PutIndexTemplateRequestTests (#30960)

The randomized alias names could contain unicode controll charactes that don't
survive an xContent rendering and parsing roundtrip when using the YAML xContent
type. This fix filters the randomized unicode string for control characters to
avoid this particular problem.

Closes #30911
