Fail rollover if duplicated alias found in template (#28110)

If a newly created index from a rollover request matches with an index 
template whose aliases contains the rollover request alias, the alias
will point to multiple indices. This will cause indexing requests to be 
rejected. To avoid such situation, we make sure that there is no
duplicated alias before creating a new index; otherwise abort and report
an error to the caller.
