[Rollup] Remove builders from TermsGroupConfig (#32507)

While working on adding the Create Rollup Job API to the 
high level REST client (#29827), I noticed that the configuration 
objects like TermsGroupConfig rely on the Builder pattern in 
order to create or parse instances. These builders are doing 
some validation but the same validation could be done within 
the constructor itself or on the server side when appropriate.

This commit removes the builder for TermsGroupConfig, 
removes some other methods that I consider not really usefull 
once the TermsGroupConfig object will be exposed in the 
high level REST client. It also simplifies the parsing logic.
