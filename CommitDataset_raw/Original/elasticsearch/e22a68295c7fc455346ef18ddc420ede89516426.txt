Tests: Make secure settings available from settings builder for tests (#25037)

This commit exposes the secure settings in Settings.Builder, so that
the current secure settings can be retrieved and added to when creating
settings for tests. This is necessary since secure settings can only be
added once to a builder, so chains of methods using settings builders
must reuse the already set mock secure settings.
