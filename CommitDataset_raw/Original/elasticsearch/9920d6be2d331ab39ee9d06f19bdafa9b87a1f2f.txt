keep plugin up to date with structure changes (#3702)

Looks like we need to split out the tests of core classes to core
and index-lifecycle ones stay in index-lifecycle.

I believe I got everything, although I may have missed at least one thing

checked status with

$ ./gradlew :x-pack-elasticsearch:plugin:index-lifecycle:check -Dtests.seed=39838421912001B4
$ ./gradlew :x-pack-elasticsearch:plugin:core:check -Dtests.seed=39838421912001B4

other things done in this PR:
- removal of a few unused variables/thrown exceptions/imports
- fix TimeseriesLifecycleTypeTests
  - an all null AllocateAction was created
- fix AllocateActionTests
  - woops. -Dtests.seed=39838421912001B4 resulted in two `null`s and an emptyMap.
    this resulted in a test failure.
