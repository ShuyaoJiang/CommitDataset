SQL: Proper handling of COUNT(field_name) and COUNT(DISTINCT field_name) (#37254)

* provide overriden `hashCode` and toString methods to account for `DISTINCT`
* change the analyzer for scenarios where `COUNT <field_name>` and `COUNT DISTINCT` have different paths
* defined a new `filter` aggregation encapsulating an `exists` query to filter out null or missing values
