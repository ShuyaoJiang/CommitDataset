[ML] Separate read from write index for results (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1397)

This is in preparation of introducing a write alias.
It adjusts all requests to persist results to do so
using a method that returns the write alias (even though
it currently returns the same as the read alias).

Relates elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#827
