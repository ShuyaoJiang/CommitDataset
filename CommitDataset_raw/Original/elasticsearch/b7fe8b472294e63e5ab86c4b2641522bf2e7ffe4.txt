Exit Windows scripts promptly on failure

When invoking the elasticsearch-env.bat batch script on Windows, if the
script exits due to an error (e.g., Java can not be found, or the wrong
version of Java is found), then the script exits. Sadly, on Windows,
this does not also terminate the caller, instead returning control. This
means we have to explicitly exit so that is what we do in this commit.
