Clarify pure wilcard matching with `query_string` (#26814)

In 5.x pure wildcard queries `*` in `query_string` are rewritten to `exists` query for efficiency.
Though this introduced a change in the document that match such queries because
`exists` query also return documents with an empty value for the field.
This change clarifies this behavior for 5.x and beyond.

Closes #26801
