Security: fix TokenMetaData equals and hashcode (#30347)

The TokenMetaData equals method compared byte arrays using `.equals` on
the arrays themselves, which is the equivalent of an `==` check. This
means that a seperate byte[] with the same contents would not be
considered equivalent to the existing one, even though it should be.

The method has been updated to use `Array#equals` and similarly the
hashcode method has been updated to call `Arrays#hashCode` instead of
calling hashcode on the array itself.
