Increase timeout for testAddNewReplicas

We flush quite often in testAddNewReplicas to create the safe index
commit with gaps in sequence numbers. This test is failing recently
because CI is too slow to complete 5 small flushes in 10 seconds.

This commit increases timeout for this test and also ensures to always
terminate the background indexing. The latter is to eliminate unrelated
failures if this test fails again.

Closes #37183
