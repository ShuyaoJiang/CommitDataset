Add note on temporary directory for Windows service

The Windows service will use a private temporary directory under the
user that is performing the installation. In cases when the service will
run as a different user, operators need a method to set this temporary
directory elsewhere. We have such a mechanism, so this commit merely
adds a note to the documentation on how to utilize it.
