[Monitoring] Remove 202 responses in favor of 200 responses (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4213)

This changes `_xpack/monitoring/_bulk` to fundamentally behave in the same
way as `_bulk` and never return 202 when data is ignored (something
`_bulk` cannot do). Instead, anyone interested will have to inspect the
returned response for the ignored flag.
