Support scrolling in SQL's CLI (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2494)

* Move CLI to TransportSqlAction
    * Moves REST endpoint from `/_cli` to `/_sql/cli`
    * Removes the special purpose CLI transport action instead
    implements the CLI entirely on the REST layer, delegating
    all SQL stuff to the same action that backs the `/_sql` REST
    API.
    * Reworks "embedded testing mode" to use a `FilterClient` to
    bounce capture the sql transport action and execute in embedded.
    * Switches CLI formatting from consuming the entire response
    to consuming just the first page of the response and returning
    a `cursor` that can be used to read the next page. That read is
    not yet implemented.
    * Switch CLI formatting from the consuming the `RowSetCursor` to
    consuming the `SqlResponse` object.
    * Adds tests for CLI formatting.
* Support next page in the cli
    * Rename cli's CommandRequest/CommandResponse to
    QueryInitRequest/QueryInitResponse to line up with jdbc
    * Implement QueryPageRequest/QueryPageResponse in cli
    * Use `byte[]` to represent the cursor in the cli. Those bytes
    mean something, but only to the server. The only reasonint that
    the client does about them is "if length == 0 then there isn't a
    next page."
    * Pull common code from jdbc's QueryInitRequest, QueryPageRequest,
    QueryInitResponse, and QueryPageResponse into the shared-proto
    project
        * By implication this switches jdbc's QueryPageRequest to using
     the same cursor implementation as the cli
