Bootstrap a new history_uuid when force allocating a stale primary (#33432)

This commit ensures that we bootstrap a new history_uuid when force
allocating a stale primary. A stale primary should never be the source
of an operation-based recovery to another shard which exists before the
forced-allocation.

Closes #26712
