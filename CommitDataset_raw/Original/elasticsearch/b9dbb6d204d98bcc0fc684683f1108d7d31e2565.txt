SQL: Run fewer tests against multiple nodes (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3625)

Rather than run every SQL test against multiple nodes we instead run a
subset of the tests simply for speed. The subset is both small but
exercises the CLI, JDBC, and REST interface and a few special "these
might be different in against multiple nodes" cases.

This drops the run time from of `gradle clean check` of these tests from
```
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 4m 49s
```

To:
```
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 2m 49s
```
