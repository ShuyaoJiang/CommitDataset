Enable Wildfly tests on JDK 9 and JDK 10

Previously we disabled these tests on JDK 9 and JDK 10 because Wildfly
10 did not support JDK 9 and JDK 10. With the release of Wildfly 11
supporting JDK 9 and JDK 10 and now that we depend on Wildfly 11 in
these tests, we can enable these tests on JDK 9 and JDK 10.
