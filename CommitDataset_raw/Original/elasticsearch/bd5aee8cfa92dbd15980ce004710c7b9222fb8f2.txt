Split disruption test suite

The disruption tests sit in a single test suite which causes these tests
to be single-threaded. We can split this test suite into multiple suites
(logically, of course) enabling them to be run in parallel reducing the
total run time of all integration tests in core. This commit splits the
discovery with service disruptions test suite into three suites
 - master disruptions
 - discovery disruptions
 - cluster disruptions

The last one could probably be better named, it is meant to represent
performing actions in the cluster (indexing, failing a shard, etc.)
while a disruption is taking place.
