Allow excluding folder names when scanning for dangling indices (#34349)

ES is scanning for dangling indices on every cluster state update. For this, it lists the subfolders of
the indices directory to determine which extra index directories exist on the node where there's no
corresponding index in the cluster state. These are potential targets for dangling index import. On
certain machine types, and with large number of indices, this subfolder listing can be horribly slow.
This means that every cluster state update will be slowed down by potentially hundreds of
milliseconds. One of the reasons for this poor performance is that Files.isDirectory() is a relatively
expensive call on some OS and JDK versions. There is no need though to do all these isDirectory
calls for folders which we know we are going to discard anyhow in the next step of the dangling
indices logic. This commit allows adding an exclusion predicate to the availableIndexFolders
methods which can dramatically speed up this method when scanning for dangling indices.
