Deprecate types in update requests. (#36181)

The following updates were made:
* Add deprecation warnings to `RestUpdateAction`, plus a test in `RestUpdateActionTests`.
* Deprecate relevant methods on the Java HLRC requests/ responses.
* Add HLRC integration tests for the typed APIs.
* Update documentation (for both the REST API and Java HLRC).
* Fix failing integration tests.

Because of an earlier PR, the REST yml tests were already updated (one version without types, and another legacy version that retains types).
