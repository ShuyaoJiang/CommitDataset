Ensure `doc_stats` are changing even if refresh is disabled (#27505)

Today if refresh is disabled the doc stats are not updated anymore.
In a bulk index scenario this might cause confusion since even if
we refresh internal readers etc. doc stats are never advancing.
This change cuts over to the internal reader that is refreshed outside
of the external readers refresh interval but always equally `fresh` or
`fresher` which will cause less confusion.
