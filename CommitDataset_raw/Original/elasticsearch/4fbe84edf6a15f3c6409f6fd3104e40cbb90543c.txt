Painless: Cleanup Cache (#33963)

* Adds equals/hashcode methods to the Painless* objects within the lookup package.
* Changes the caches to use the Painless* objects as keys as well as values. This forces 
future changes to taken into account the appropriate values for caching.
* Deletes the existing caching objects in favor of Painless* objects. This removes a pair of 
bugs that were not taking into account subtle corner cases related to augmented methods 
and caching.
* Uses the Painless* objects to check for equivalency in existing Painless* objects that 
may have already been added to a PainlessClass. This removes a bug related to return 
not being appropriately checked when adding methods.
* Cleans up several error messages.
