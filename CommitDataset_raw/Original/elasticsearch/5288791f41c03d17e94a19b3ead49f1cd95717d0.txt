[ML] Specify only concrete indices during deletion (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1966)

Following elastic/elasticsearch#23997 this was only working due to
the way we were suppressing certain errors during job deletion.

This PR makes the situations we want to ignore during job deletion
clearer and adheres to the intention of elastic/elasticsearch#23997
by only specifying concrete indices to the `indices` arguments of
deletion calls.
