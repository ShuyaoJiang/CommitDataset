Fork Groovy compiler onto compile Java home

We use the --release flag which is only available starting in JDK
9. Since Gradle could be running on JDK 8 without forking the compiler,
compilation will occur with the Java home of Gradle. This commit adds a
fork flag to the compiler Java home so that we use the right compiler.
