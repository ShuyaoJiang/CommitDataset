Preserve `date_histogram` format when aggregating on unmapped fields (#35254)

Currently when aggregating on an unmapped date field (e.g. using a
date_histogram) we don't preserve the aggregations `format` setting but instead
use the default format. This can lead to loosing the aggregations `format` when
aggregating over several indices where some of them contain unmapped date fields
and are encountered first in the reduce phase.
