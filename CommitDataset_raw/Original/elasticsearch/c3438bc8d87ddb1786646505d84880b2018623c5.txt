Switch some watcher tests to new style Requests (#33044)

In #29623 we added `Request` object flavored requests to the low level
REST client and in #30315 we deprecated the old `performRequest`s. This
changes all calls in the `x-pack/qa/smoke-test-monitoring-with-watcher`,
`x-pack/qa/smoke-test-watcher`, and
`x-pack/qa/smoke-test-watcher-with-security` projects to use the new
versions.
