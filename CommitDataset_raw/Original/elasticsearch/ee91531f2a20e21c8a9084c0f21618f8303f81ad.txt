Fix test which still uses default type (#39997)

org.elasticsearch.xpack.monitoring.action.MonitoringBulkRequestTests#testAddRequestContent
can still randomly use a defaultType for monitoring. The defaultType
support has been removed as of PR #39888. Prior to its's removal it
would default the type if one is not specified. The _type on the monitoring
bulk end point is currently required, though it is not used as the final index type
(which defaultType would have).

Closes #39980
