Watcher: Ensure mail message ids are unique per watch action (#30112)

Email message IDs are supposed to be unique. In order to guarantee this,
we need to take the action id of a watch action into account as well,
not just the watch id from the watch execution context. This prevents
that two actions from the same watch execution end up with the same
message id.
