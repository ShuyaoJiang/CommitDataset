Add fromXContent method to ClearScrollResponse (#24909)

ClearScrollResponse can print out its content into an XContentBuilder as it implements ToXContentObject. This PR add a fromXContent method to it so that we are able to recreate the response object when parsing the response back. This will be used in the high level REST client.
