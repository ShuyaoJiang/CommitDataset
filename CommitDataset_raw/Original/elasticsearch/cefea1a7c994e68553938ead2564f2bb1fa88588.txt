Build: Add gradle plugin for configuring meta plugin (#28276)

This commit adds a gradle plugin to ease development of meta plugins.
Applying the plugin will generated the meta plugin properties based on
the es_meta_plugin configuration object, which includes name and
description. The plugins to include within the meta plugin are
configured through the `plugins` list. An integ test task is also
automatically added.
