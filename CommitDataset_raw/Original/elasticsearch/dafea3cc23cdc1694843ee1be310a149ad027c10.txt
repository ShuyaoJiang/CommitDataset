Minor search controller changes (#36479)

This commit contains a few minor changes to our search code:

- adjust the visibility of a couple of methods in our search code to package private from public or protected.
- make some of the `SearchPhaseController` methods static where possible
- rename one of the `SearchPhaseController#reducedQueryPhase` methods (used only for scroll requests) to `reducedScrollQueryPhase` without the `isScrollRequest` argument which was always set to `true`
- replace leniency in `SearchPhaseController#setShardIndex` with an assert to make sure that we never set the shard index twice
- remove two null checks where the checked field can never be null
- resolve an unchecked warning
- replace `List#toArray` invocation that creates an array providing the true size with array creation of length 0
- correct a couple of typos in comments
