SQL: Fix doc pointer to SQL's tests

The docs include portions of the SQL tests and for that to work they
need to point to position of the tests. They use a relative directory
but relative to *what*? That turns out to be a fairly complex thing to
answer, luckilly, `index.x.asciidoc` defines `xes-repo-dir` which points
to the root of the xpack docs. We can use that to find the sql tests
without having to answer the "relative to what?" question in two places.
