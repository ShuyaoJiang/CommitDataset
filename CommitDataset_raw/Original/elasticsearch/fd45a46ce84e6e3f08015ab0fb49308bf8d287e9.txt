Deprecate `isShardsAcked()` in favour of `isShardsAcknowledged()` (#27819)

Several responses include the shards_acknowledged flag (indicating whether the
requisite number of shard copies started before the completion of the operation)
and there are two different getters used : isShardsAcknowledged() and isShardsAcked().

This PR deprecates the isShardsAcked() in favour of isShardsAcknowledged() in 
CreateIndexResponse, RolloverResponse and CreateIndexClusterStateUpdateResponse.

Closes #27784
