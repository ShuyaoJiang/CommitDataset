Set processors on audit remote client

When creating a transport client for a remote index audit trail, we are
implicitly allowing the construction of this transport client to
initialize the number of processors that Netty thinks are on the
system. Since we never pushed down the number of processors, this will
always default to the number of cores on the machine. If the user has
also set the processors setting, when the server bootstraps it will try
to push the number of processors down to Netty too. If this value does
not match the number of cores, we will fail in bootstrap because we
guard against initializing the number of processors that Netty sees to
different values. Instead, the transport client should inherit the
number of processors too and push this down when it pushes the number of
processors down to Netty. We have to worry about another possibility: an
explicit setting for the number of processors for the transport client
so we require this matches the inherited value.
