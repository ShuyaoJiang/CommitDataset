Core: Combine doExecute methods in TransportAction (#31517)

TransportAction currently contains 2 doExecute methods, one which takes
a the task, and one that does not. The latter is what some subclasses
implement, while the first one just calls the latter, dropping the given
task. This commit combines these methods, in favor of just always
assuming a task is present.
