SQL: Internal refactoring of operators as functions (#34097)

Centralize and simplify the script generation between operators and functions which are currently decoupled. As part of this process most predicates (<, <=, etc...) were made ScalarFunction as their purpose and functionality is quite similar (see % and MOD functions).
Renamed ProcessDefinition to Pipe
Add ScriptWeaver as a mixin-in interface for script customization
Add logic for equals/lte/lt
Improve BinaryOperator/expression toString
Minimize duplication across string functions
