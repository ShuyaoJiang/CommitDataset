Fix third-party audit tasks on JDK 8

This one is interesting. The third party audit task runs inside the
Gradle JVM. This means that if Gradle is started on JDK 8, the third
party audit tasks will fail as a result of the changes to support
building Elasticsearch with the JDK 9 compiler. This commit reverts the
third party audit changes to support running this task when Gradle is
started with JDK 8.
