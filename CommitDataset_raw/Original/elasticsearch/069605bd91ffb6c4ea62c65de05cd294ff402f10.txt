Do not count shard changes tasks against REST tests (#33738)

When executing CCR REST tests it is going to be expected after global
checkpoint polling goes in that shard changes tasks can still be pending
at the end of the test. One way to deal with this is to set a low
timeout on these polls, but then that means we are not executing our
REST tests with our default production settings and instead would be
using an unrealistic low timeout. Alternatively, since we expect these
tasks to be there, we can not count them against the test. That is what
this commit does.
