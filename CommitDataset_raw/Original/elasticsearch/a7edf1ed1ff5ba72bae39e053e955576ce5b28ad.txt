TEST: Ensure a manual flush always occur (#36188)

The test testLookupSeqNoByIdInLucene fails because it expects if any
change should be visible after a flush. However, that flush might be
ignored if the waitIfOngoing parameter is false (the default value), and
there is an ongoing flush triggered after merge is running.

Closes #35823
