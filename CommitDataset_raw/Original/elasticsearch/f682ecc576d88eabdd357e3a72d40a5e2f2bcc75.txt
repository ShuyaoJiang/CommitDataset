[Rollup] Remove `computed` field from rollup docs

The computed field contained a list of all aggs that were computed
for this particular rollup doc.  It was used to help filter to the
correct rollup job/set of jobs.

But this functionality was never perfect, and has been obsoleted by
validating the rollup caps while searching.  So we can remove the
computed field and save a bunch of space (since they were quite bulky)
