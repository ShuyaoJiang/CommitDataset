[ML] Transition to typeless (mapping) APIs (#39256)

ML has historically used doc as the single mapping type but reindex in 7.x
will change the mapping to _doc. Switching to the typeless APIs handles the
case where the mapping type is either doc or _doc. This change removes 
deprecated typed usages.
