Use epoch millis for token expiration instead of ZonedDateTime (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1417)

For user tokens, we were storing the expiration time as a date with the date time format in the
mappings. Occasionally, we would get CI failures due to parsing the date and having an invalid
format. This change simplifies the user tokens to simply use an Instant and convert it to the epoch
millis when we index the document. This eliminates the need for a date formatter and should ensure
we no longer have issues with parsing the dates.

Additionally, the TokenAuthIntegTests#testExpireMultipleTimes could fail if the token was expired
but the approximation for the expiration time was after the current time. In order to resolve this
we get the exact expiration time from the token and use that in the test.
