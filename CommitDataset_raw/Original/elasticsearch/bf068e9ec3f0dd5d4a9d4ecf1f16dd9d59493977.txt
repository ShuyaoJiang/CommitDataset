[ML] Avoid stack traces in the log when deleting jobs (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1615)

Now we've set the option for one type per index it causes a stack trace
in to be logged if we issue a request to delete two documents with
different types.  We only do this to cover the case of documents left
over from v5.4.  We can avoid it by deleting by query using just the
document IDs.
