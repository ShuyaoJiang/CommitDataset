Use TestEnvironment factory method to create test Environment objects (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2860)

This is the X-Pack side of elastic/elasticsearch#27235.  To force people
who construct an Environment object in production code to think about the
correct setting of configPath there is no longer a single argument
constructor in the Environment class.  Instead there is a factory method
in the test framework to replace it.  Having this in the test framework
ensures that there is no way to use it in production code.
