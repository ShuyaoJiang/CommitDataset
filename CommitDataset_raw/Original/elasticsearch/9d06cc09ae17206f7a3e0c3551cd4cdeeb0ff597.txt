Reindex: Harden old ES version test

Our rest client throws exceptions in funny ways that might cause
`suppressed` exceptions to be eaten. This works around that in the
reindex-from-old tests so we don't stomp on a real failure. It is fairly
diryt so we should work on fixing the high level rest client.

Relates to #25453
