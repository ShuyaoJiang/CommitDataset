Forbid negative field boosts in analyzed queries (#37930)

This change forbids negative field boost in the `query_string`, `simple_query_string`
and `multi_match` queries.
Negative boosts are not allowed in Lucene 8 (scores must be positive).
The backport of this change to 6x will turn the error into a deprecation warning
in order to raise the awareness of this breaking change in 7.0.

Closes #33309
