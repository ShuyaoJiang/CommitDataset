Azure repository: Move to named configurations as we do for S3 repository

We should have the same behavior for Azure repositories as we have for S3 (see #22762).

Instead of:

```yml
cloud:
    azure:
        storage:
            my_account1:
                account: your_azure_storage_account1
                key: your_azure_storage_key1
                default: true
            my_account2:
                account: your_azure_storage_account2
                key: your_azure_storage_key2
```

Support something like:

```
azure.client:
            default:
                account: your_azure_storage_account1
                key: your_azure_storage_key1
            my_account2:
                account: your_azure_storage_account2
                key: your_azure_storage_key2
```

Then instead of:

```
PUT _snapshot/my_backup3
{
    "type": "azure",
    "settings": {
        "account": "my_account2"
    }
}
```

Use:

```
PUT _snapshot/my_backup3
{
    "type": "azure",
    "settings": {
        "config": "my_account2"
    }
}
```

If someone uses:

```
PUT _snapshot/my_backup3
{
    "type": "azure"
}
```

It will use the `default` azure repository settings.

And mark as deprecated old settings.

Closes #22763.
