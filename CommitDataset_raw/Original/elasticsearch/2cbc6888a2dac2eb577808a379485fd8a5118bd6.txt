HLRC: Fix strict setting exception handling (#37247)

The LLRC's exception handling for strict mode was previously throwing an
exception the HLRC assumed was an error response. This is not the case
if the result is valid in strict mode, as it will return the proper
response wrapped in an exception with warnings. This commit fixes the
HLRC such that it no longer spews if it encounters a strict LLRC
response.

Closes #37090
