Test fix - GraphExploreResponse HLRC xContent ordering was unreliable(#34473)

xContent ordering is unreliable when derived from map insertions but the parsed objectsâ€™ .equals() methods have the sort logic required to prove connections and vertices are correct. Disabled the xContent equivalence checks.
