Painless: Fix Semicolon Regression (#33212)

Trailers (statements following something like an if statement) that don't use brackets currently require a semicolon even if they're the last statement. This is a regression caused by (#29566) and noted by (#33193). This change fixes the regression and adds a test for the broken case.
