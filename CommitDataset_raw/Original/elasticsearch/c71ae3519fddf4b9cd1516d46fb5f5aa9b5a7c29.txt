Search: Fairer balancing when routing searches by session ID (#24671)

A user reported uneven balancing of load on nodes handling search requests from Kibana which supplies a session ID in a routing preference. Each shardId was selecting the same node for a given session ID because one data node had all primaries and the other data node held all replicas after cluster startup.
This change counteracts the tendency to opt for the same node given the same user-supplied preference by incorporating shard ID in the hash of the preference key. This will help randomise node choices across shards.

Closes #24642
