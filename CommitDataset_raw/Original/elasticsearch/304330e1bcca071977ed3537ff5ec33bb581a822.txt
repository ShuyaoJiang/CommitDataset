[ML] Specify ML_ORIGIN when calling the job update endpoint internally (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3110)

This change applies the same pattern that was applied in elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3054 to a new
method that was introduced in elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2975 which was in-flight at the same time
so missed the original batch of changes.

relates elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3109
