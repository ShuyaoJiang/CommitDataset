Grant .tasks access to kibana_system role (#35573)

Kibana now uses the tasks API to manage automatic reindexing of the
.kibana index during upgrades.

The implementation of the tasks API requires that
1. the user executing the task can create & write to the ".tasks" index
2. the user checking on the status of the task can read (Get) the
   relevant document from the ".tasks" index
