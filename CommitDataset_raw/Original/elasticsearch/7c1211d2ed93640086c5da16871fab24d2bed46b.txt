Scripting: Add StatefulFactoryType as optional intermediate factory in script contexts (#24974)

ScriptContexts currently understand a FactoryType that can produce
instances of the script InstanceType. However, for search scripts, this
does not work as we have the concept of LeafSearchScript that is created
per lucene segment. This commit effectively renames the existing
SearchScript class into SearchScript.LeafFactory, which is a new,
optional, class that can be defined within a ScriptContext.
LeafSearchScript is effectively renamed back into SearchScript. This
change allows the model of stateless factory -> stateful factory ->
script instance to continue, but in a generic way that any script
context may take advantage of.
