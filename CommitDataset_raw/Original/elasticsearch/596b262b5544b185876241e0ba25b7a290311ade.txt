Isolate REST client single host tests (#30504)

These tests are sharing the same server and client for every test. Yet,
we are seeing some tests fail with mysterious connection resets. It is
not clear what is happening but one theory is that the tests are
interfering with each other. This commit moves to use a separate server
and client per test.
