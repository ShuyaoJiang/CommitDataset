Add reason to global checkpoint updates on replica

Updating the global checkpoint on a replica can occur for a few
different reasons:
 - from inlined global checkpoint updates
 - from a primary term transition
 - from finalizing recovery

Yet, the trace logging for a global checkpoint update does not present
this information that can be useful when tracing test failures. This
commit adds a reason for the global checkpoint update on a replica so
that we can trace these updates.
