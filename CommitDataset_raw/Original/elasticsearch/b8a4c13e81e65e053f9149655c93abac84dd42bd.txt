Init global checkpoint after copy commit in peer recovery (#40823)

Today a new replica of a closed index does not have a safe commit
invariant when its engine is opened because we won't initialize the
global checkpoint on a recovering replica until the finalize step. With
this change, we can achieve that property by creating a new translog
with the global checkpoint from the primary at the end of phase 1.
