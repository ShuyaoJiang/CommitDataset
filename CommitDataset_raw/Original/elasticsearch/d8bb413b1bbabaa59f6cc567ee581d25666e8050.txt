Configure heap dump path out of the box

The JVM defaults to dumping the heap to the working directory of
Elasticsearch. For the RPM and Debian packages, this location is
/usr/share/elasticsearch. This directory is not writable by the
elasticsearch user, so by default heap dumps in this situation are
lost. This commit modifies the packaging for the RPM and Debian packages
to set the heap dump path to /var/lib/elasticsearch as the default
location for dumping the heap. This location is writable by the
elasticsearch user by default. We add documentation of this important
setting if /var/lib/elasticsearch is not suitable for receiving heap
dumps.
