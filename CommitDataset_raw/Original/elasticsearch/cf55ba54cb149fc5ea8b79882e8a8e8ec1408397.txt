Make -try xlint warning disabled by default. (#40833)

Many gradle projects specifically use the -try exclude flag, because
there are many cases where auto-closeable resource ignore is never
referenced in body of corresponding try statement. Suppressing this
warning specifically in each case that it happens using
`@SuppressWarnings("try")` would be very verbose.

This change removes `-try` from any gradle project and adds it to the
build plugin. Also this change removes exclude flags from gradle projects
that is already specified in build plugin (for example -deprecation).
