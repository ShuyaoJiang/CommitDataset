Reindex: Fold "from old" tests into reindex module (#30142)

This folds the `:qa:reindex-from-old` project into the `:modules:reindex`
project. This should speed up the build marginally by removing a single
clsuter start up at the cost of having to wait for old versions of
Elasticsearch to start up when checking reindex's integration tests.
Those don't take that long so this feels worth it.
