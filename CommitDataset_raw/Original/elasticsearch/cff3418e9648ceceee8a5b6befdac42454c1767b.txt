Tests: Only restart watcher on watcher tests

In order to not restart watcher on every test, this checks
if this is a watcher test and only restarts watcher in that case.

In addition this also checks if watcher is not marked as started.
as otherwise restarting does not make sense. Lastly, this waits until
watcher is marked as started before proceeding.
