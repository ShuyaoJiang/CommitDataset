Introduce SqlSettings for handling per-client configuration

To avoid leaking client information across the entire code-base, client
settings like TimeZone or pagination are stored in
SqlSession>SqlSettings which are available as a ThreadLocal (during
analysis) so that components that need them, can pick them up.

Since ES internally uses Joda, the date/time functionality relies on Joda,
whenever possible to match the behavior.
