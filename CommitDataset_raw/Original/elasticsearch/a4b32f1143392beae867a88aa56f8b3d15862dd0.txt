Remove concurrency in testFailLeaderReplicaShard (#36607)

testFailLeaderReplicaShard periodically fails because we concurrently
index to the leader group and close one of its replicas. If a
replication request hits a closing shard, we will fail that shard;
however, failing a shard is supported by the test framework - this makes
the test fail.
