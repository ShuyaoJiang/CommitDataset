[CCR] Add metadata to keep track of the index uuid of the leader index in the follow index (#33367)

The follow index api checks if the recorded uuid in the follow index matches
with uuid of the leader index and fails otherwise. This validation will
prevent a follow index from following an incompatible leader index.

The create_and_follow api will automatically add this custom index metadata
when it creates the follow index.

Closes #31505
