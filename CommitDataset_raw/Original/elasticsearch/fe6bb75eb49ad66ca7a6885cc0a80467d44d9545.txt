Rename ranking evaluation `quality_level` to `metric_score` (#32168)

The notion of "quality" is an overloaded term in the search ranking evaluation 
context. Its usually used to decribe certain levels of "good" vs. "bad" of a 
seach result with respect to the users information need. We currently report the 
result of the ranking evaluation as `quality_level` which is a bit missleading.
This changes the response parameter name to `metric_score` which fits better.
