Untangle Engine Constructor logic (#28245)

Currently we have a fairly complicated logic in the engine constructor logic to deal with all the 
various ways we want to mutate the lucene index and translog we're opening.

We can:
1) Create an empty index
2) Use the lucene but create a new translog
3) Use both
4) Force a new history uuid in all cases.

This leads complicated code flows which makes it harder and harder to make sure we cover all the 
corner cases. This PR tries to take another approach. Constructing an InternalEngine always opens 
things as they are and all needed modifications are done by static methods directly on the 
directory, one at a time.
