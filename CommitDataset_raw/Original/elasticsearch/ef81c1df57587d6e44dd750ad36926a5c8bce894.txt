Ensure to release translog snapshot in primary-replica resync (#32045)

Previously we create a translog snapshot inside the resync method, 
and that snapshot will be closed by the resync listener. However, if 
the resync method throws an exception before the resync listener 
is initialized, the translog snapshot won't be released.

Closes #32030
