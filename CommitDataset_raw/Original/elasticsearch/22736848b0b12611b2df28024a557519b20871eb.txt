Always destroy Vagrant boxes before tests (#28813)

Today we do not destroy Vagrant boxes before tests. This is because
constantly reprovisioning these boxes is time-consuming. Yet, not
destroying these boxes can lead to state being left around that impacts
subsequent test runs. To address this, we now always destroy these boxes
before tests and provide a flag to set if this is not desired while
iterating locally.
