Add support for rest_total_hits_as_int in watcher (#36035)

This change adds the support for rest_total_hits_as_int
in the watcher search inputs. Setting this parameter in the request
will transform the search response to contain the total hits as
a number (instead of an object).
Note that this parameter is currently a noop since #35849 is not
merged.

Closes #36008
