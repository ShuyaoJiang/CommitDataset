Properly format IndexGraveyard deletion date as date (#27362)

The toXContent method for IndexGraveYard (which is a collection of tombstones for explicitly marking indices as deleted in the cluster state) confused timeValue with dateField, resulting in output of the form "delete_date" : "23424.3d" instead of "delete_date":"2017-11-13T15:50:51.614Z".
