Watcher: Properly url encode room names (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2896)

Room names in hipchat were not properly URL encoded, thus room names
with spaces would not work as expected. This fixes all the hipchat
accounts by properly using spaces.

Also the hipchat tests are reenabled, as the IT team gave me new access to hipchat, 
allowing to create a fresh set of oauth tokens for the integration account type.

The HipchatServiceTests have also been converted to XPackSingleNodeTestCase
