Move persistent task registrations to core (#30755)

Persistent tasks was moved from X-Pack to core in #28455.
However, registration of the named writables and named
X-content was left in X-Pack.

This change moves the registration of the named writables
and named X-content into core.  Additionally, the persistent
task actions are no longer registered in the X-Pack client
plugin, as they are already registered in ActionModule.
