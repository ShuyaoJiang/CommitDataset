Ensure that ActionListener is called exactly once

This bug was introduced in #36893 and had the effect that
execution would continue after calling onFailure on the the
listener in checkIfTokenIsValid in the case that the token is
expired. In a case of many consecutive requests this could lead to
the unwelcome side effect of an expired access token producing a
successful authentication response.
