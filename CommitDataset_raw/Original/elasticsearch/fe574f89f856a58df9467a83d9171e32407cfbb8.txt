CCR: Translog op on primary should have versionType

Normally translog operations will not be replayed on the primary.
Following engine is an exception where we replay translog on both
primary and replica as a non-primary strategy.  Even though we won't use
the version_type in the following engine, we still need to pass a valid
value for the primary operation in order not to trip assertions in an
engine.

This commit passes version_type EXTERNAL for translog operation if its
origin is primary.
