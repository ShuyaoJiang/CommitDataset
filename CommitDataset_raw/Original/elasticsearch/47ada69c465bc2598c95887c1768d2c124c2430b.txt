Zen2: Move most integration tests to Zen2 (#35678)

Zen2 is now feature-complete enough to run most ESIntegTestCase tests. The changes in this PR
are as follows:
- ClusterSettingsIT is adapted to not be Zen1 specific anymore (it was using Zen1 settings).
- Some of the integration tests require persistent storage of the cluster state, which is not fully
implemented yet (see #33958). These tests keep running with Zen1 for now but will be switched
over as soon as that is fully implemented.
- Some very few integration tests are not running yet with Zen2 for other reasons, depending on
some of the other open points in #32006.
