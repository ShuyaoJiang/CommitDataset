Remove a dependency cycle in the build (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2122)

This is a hack to remove a dependency cycle I added in elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2109. I think
it'd be cleaner to remove the cycle by making sql its own plugin that
doesn't depend on the rest of x-pack-elasticsearch but is still
included within x-pack-elasticsearch. But that is a broader change.
