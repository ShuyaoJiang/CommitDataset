Watcher: Start watcher on master node only with mixed versions (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1983)

When there are data or master nodes in the cluster, that are older
than ES 6.0 alpha3, then watcher will only start on the master node.

Changed all transport actions to be master node actions, as there is
already a method to decide to run locally, which we can piggyback on.
