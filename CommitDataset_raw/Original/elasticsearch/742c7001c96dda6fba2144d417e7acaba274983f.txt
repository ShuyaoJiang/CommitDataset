Watcher: Ensure watcher service calls are properly caught (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3906)

In order to prevent exceptions to bubble up to the thread pool exception
handler, this properly wraps all the calls for the watcher service
within an executor into an AbstractRunnable to catch and log a possible
exception.
