GEO: More robust handling of ignore_malformed in geoshape parsing (#35603)

Adds an XContent sub parser class that can to wrap another
XContent parser at the beginning of an object and allow skiping
all children in case of the parsing failure. It also uses this
subparser to ignore the rest of the GeoJson shape if the 
parsing fails and we need to ignore the geoshape due to the 
ignore_malformed flag.

Supersedes #34498

Closes #34047
