Localhost check: check if addr bound to interface (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1901)

This is related to elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1217 and elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1896. Right now we are checking if an
incoming address is the loopback address or a special local addres. It
appears that we also need to check if that address is bound to a
network interface to be thorough in our localhost check.

This change mimicks how we check if localhost in `PatternRule`.
