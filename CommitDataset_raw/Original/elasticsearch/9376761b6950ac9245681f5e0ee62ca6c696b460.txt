SQL: Fix issue with date columns returned always in UTC (#40163)

When selecting columns of ES type `date` (SQL's DATETIME) the
`FieldHitExtractor` was not using the timezone of the client session
but always resorted to UTC. The same behaviour (UTC only) was
encountered also for grouping keys (`CompositeKeyExtractor`) and
for First/Last functions on dates (`TopHitsAggExtractor`).

Fixes: #40152
