[TEST] wait until reindex tasks ready for rethrottle (#26250)

When slices is set as auto, there's an additional network call
needed for the reindex tasks to know how to rethrottle. Sometimes
the rethrottle action happens before the reindex task is fully
initialized, so in the test we wait for the task to be ready.

This commit also adds some safeguards to ensure that
cancel and rethrottle operations are handled correctly

Closes #26192
