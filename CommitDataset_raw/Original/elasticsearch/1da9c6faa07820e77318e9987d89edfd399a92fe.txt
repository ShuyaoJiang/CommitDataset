SQL: Fix translation of math functions to painless (#35910)

`SIGN` and `RADIANS` where wrongly overriding `mathFunction()`.
Converted `mathFunction()` to private in `MathFunction` since it
shouldn't be overriden, as it uses the assigned `MathOperation`
to get the funtion name for painless scripts.

Fixes: #35654
