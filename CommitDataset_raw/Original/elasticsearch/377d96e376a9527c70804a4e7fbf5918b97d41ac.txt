Remove initial_master_nodes on node restart (#37580)

Some tests (e.g. testRestoreIndexWithShardsMissingInLocalGateway) were split-braining since
being switched to Zen2 because the bootstrap setting was left around when nodes got restarted
with data folders wiped.

The test in question here was starting one node (which autobootstrapped to that single node), then
another node. The first node was then shut down (after excluding it from the voting configuration),
its data folder wiped, and restarted. After restart, the node had an empty data folder yet
initial_master_nodes set to itself (i.e. same name). This made the node sometimes form a cluster of
its own, and not rejoin the existing cluster with the other node.
