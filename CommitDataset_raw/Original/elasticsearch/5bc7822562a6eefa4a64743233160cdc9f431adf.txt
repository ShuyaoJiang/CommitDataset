[Geo] Integrate Lucene's LatLonShape (BKD Backed GeoShapes) as default `geo_shape` indexing approach (#35320)

This commit  exposes lucene's LatLonShape field as the
default type in GeoShapeFieldMapper. To use the new 
indexing approach, simply set "type" : "geo_shape" in 
the mappings without setting any of the strategy, precision, 
tree_levels, or distance_error_pct parameters. Note the 
following when using the new indexing approach:

* geo_shape query does not support querying by 
MULTIPOINT.
* LINESTRING and MULTILINESTRING queries do not 
yet support WITHIN relation.
* CONTAINS relation is not yet supported.
The tree, precision, tree_levels, distance_error_pct, 
and points_only parameters are deprecated.
