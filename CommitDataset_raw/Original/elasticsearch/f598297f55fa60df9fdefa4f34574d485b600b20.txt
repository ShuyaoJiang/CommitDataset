Add predicate_token_filter (#33431)

This allows users to filter out tokens from a TokenStream using painless scripts, 
instead of having to write specialised Java code and packaging it up into a plugin.

The commit also refactors the AnalysisPredicateScript.Token class so that it wraps
and makes read-only an AttributeSource.
