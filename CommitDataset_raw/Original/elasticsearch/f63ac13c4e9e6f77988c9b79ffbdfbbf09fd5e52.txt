Optimise rejection of out-of-range `long` values (#40325)

Today if you try and insert a very large number like `1e9999999` into a long
field we first construct this number as a `BigDecimal`, convert this to a
`BigInteger` and then reject it because it is out of range. Unfortunately
making such a large `BigInteger` is rather expensive.

We can avoid this expense by performing a (weaker) range check on the
`BigDecimal` representation of incoming `long`s too.
