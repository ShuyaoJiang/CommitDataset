Switch sql audit tests from index to the log file (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2753)

This is *way* faster because we don't have to wait for the audit
events from previous test runs to drain into the index. And we
don't have to wait for the index's refresh cycle. We have to parse
the log lines which is a bit more brittle but it feels worth it
at this point.
