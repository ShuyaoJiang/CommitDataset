[Docs] Clarify accessing Date methods in painless (#33560)

The documentation currently tells users to use `doc['event_date'].value.getMillis` to access
milliseconds in a date. It turns out the way it works is `doc['event_date'].value.millis`. This 
change corrects this and gives a hint at how other date related methods work.
