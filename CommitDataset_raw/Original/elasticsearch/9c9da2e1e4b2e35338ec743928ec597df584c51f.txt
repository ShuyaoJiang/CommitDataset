[Monitoring] Remove Legacy Monitoring Indices (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2513)

This changes Monitoring's Cleaner Service to remove any legacy Monitoring index that is appropriately old.

This includes any `.marvel-*` index and also the "data" indices used by both Marvel and 5.0 - 5.4 versions of X-Pack monitoring, as well as the legacy alerts index.
