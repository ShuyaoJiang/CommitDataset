Remove parameterization from TcpTransport (#27407)

This commit is a follow up to the work completed in #27132. Essentially
it transitions two more methods (sendMessage and getLocalAddress) from
Transport to TcpChannel. With this change, there is no longer a need for
TcpTransport to be aware of the specific type of channel a transport
returns. So that class is no longer parameterized by channel type.
