Generalize remote license checker (#32971)

Machine learning has baked a remote license checker for use in checking
license compatibility of a remote license. This remote license checker
has general usage for any feature that relies on a remote cluster. For
example, cross-cluster replication will pull changes from a remote
cluster and require that the local and remote clusters have platinum
licenses. This commit generalizes the remote cluster license check for
use in cross-cluster replication.
