Add start and stop time to cat recovery API (#40378)

The cat recovery API is incredibly useful. Yet it is missing the start
and stop time as an option from the output. This commit adds these as
options to the cat recovery API. We elect to make these not visible by
default to avoid breaking the output that users might rely on.
