Only turn to follower when term bumping on follower check (#36449)

Deals with a situation where a follower becomes disconnected from the leader, but only for such a
short time where it becomes candidate and puts up a NO_MASTER_BLOCK, but then receives a
follower check from the leader. If the leader does not notice the node disconnecting, it is important
for the node not to be turned back into a follower but try and join the leader again.

We still should prefer the node into a follower on a follower check when this follower check triggers
a term bump as this can help during a leader election to quickly have a leader turn all other nodes
into followers, even before the leader has had the chance to transfer a possibly very large cluster
state.

Closes #36428
