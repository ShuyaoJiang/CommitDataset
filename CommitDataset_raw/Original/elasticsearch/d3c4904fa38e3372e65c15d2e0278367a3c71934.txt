Painless: Clean up add methods in PainlessLookup (#32258)

This is largely mechanical change that cleans up the addConstructor, addMethod, and 
addFields methods in PainlessLookup. Changes include renamed variables, better error 
messages, and some minor code movement to make it more maintainable long term.
