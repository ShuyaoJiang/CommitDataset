Add NoOps to Lucene for failed delete ops (#33217)

Today we add a NoOp to Lucene and translog if we fail to process an
indexing operation. However, we are only adding NoOps to translog for
delete operations. In order to have a complete history in Lucene, we
should add NoOps of failed delete operations to both Lucene and translog.
