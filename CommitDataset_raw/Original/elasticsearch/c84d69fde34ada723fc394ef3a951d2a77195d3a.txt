[DOCS] Fix ML post_data docs (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2689)

It was pointed out in
https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net/pull/2856#discussion_r142830656
that our post_data docs incorrectly say that reset_start and reset_end are
body parameters.  In fact they are query parameters.

There were also a number of other errors and ommissions on this page that I
have attempted to correct.
