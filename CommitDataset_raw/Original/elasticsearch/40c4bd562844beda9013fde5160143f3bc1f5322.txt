Preserve response headers on cluster update task (#31421)

#31241 changed the cluster state update tasks to run under system context. The context wrapping
did not preserve response headers, though. This has led to a test failure on 6.x #31408, as the
deprecation warnings were not carried back anymore to the caller when creating an index. This
commit changes the restorable context supplier to preserve response headers.
