Security index expands to a single replica (#33131)

This change removes the use of 0-all for auto expand replicas for the
security index. The use of 0-all causes some unexpected behavior with
certain allocation settings. This change allows us to avoid these with
a default install. If necessary, the number of replicas can be tuned by
the user.
