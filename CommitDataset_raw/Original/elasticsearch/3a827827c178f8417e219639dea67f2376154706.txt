Avoid failing install if system-sysctl is masked

On Debian-based systems the install scripts are run with set -e meaning
that if there is an error in executing one of these scripts then the
script fails. If systemd-sysctl is masked then trying to restart the
systemd-sysctl service to pick up the changes to vm.max_map_count will
fail leading to the post-install script failing. Instead, we should
account for the possbility of failure here by not letting the command to
restart this service exit with non-zero status code. This commit does
this, and adds a test for this situation.
