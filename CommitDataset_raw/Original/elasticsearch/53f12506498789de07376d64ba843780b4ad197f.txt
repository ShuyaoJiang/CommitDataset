Allow AVX-512 on JDK 11+ (#40828)

We previously found a bug in the JVM where AVX-512 instructions could
crash the JVM to crash with a segmentation fault. This bug impacted JDK
9 and JDK 10, but was most prominent on JDK 10 because AVX-512 was
enabled there by default. In JDK 11, this bug is reported fixed so this
commit restricts the disabling of AVX-512 to JDK 10 only. Since we no
longer support JDK 10 for any versions that this commit will be
integrated into (7.1, 8.0), we simply remove the disabling of this flag
from the JVM options.
