Update SSLTrustRestrictionTests for JDK11 (#34131)

In prior versions of Java, we expected to see a SSLHandshakeException
when starting a handshake with a server that we do not trust. In JDK11,
the exception has changed to a SSLException, which
SSLHandshakeException extends. This is most likely a side effect of the
TLS 1.3 changes in JDK11. This change updates the test to catch the
SSLException instead of the SSLHandshakeException and enables the test
to work on JDK8 through JDK11.
