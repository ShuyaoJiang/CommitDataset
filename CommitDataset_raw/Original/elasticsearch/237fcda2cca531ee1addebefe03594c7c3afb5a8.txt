Disable dynamic mapping update in testTransportBulkTasks (#38073)

If a replica does not have a right mapping yet, we will retry the index
request on that replica; then the actual tasks is higher than the
expected tasks. Since #31140 this happens more frequently for we no
longer require acking on the dynamic mapping of index requests.
