[Zen2] Change unsafe bootstrap nodes count to nodes list in tests (#36559)

This commit modifies ESSingleNodeTestCase and ESIntegTestCase and
several concrete test classes to use node names when bootstrapping the
cluster.

Today ClusterBootstrapService.INITIAL_MASTER_NODE_COUNT_SETTING
setting is used to bootstrap clusters in tests. Instead, we want to use
ClusterBootrstapService.INITIAL_MASTER_NODES_SETTING and get rid of
the former setting eventually.

There were two main problems when refactoring InternalTestCluster:

1. Nodes are created one-by-one in buildNode method. And node.name
is created in this method as well. It's not suitable for bootstrapping,
because we need to have the names of all master eligible nodes in
advance, before creating the node with bootstrapping configuration set.
We address this issue by separating buildNode into two methods:
getNodeSettings and buildNode. We first iterate over all nodes to
get nodes settings, then change the setting for the bootstrapping node
and then proceed with building the node.
2. If autoManageMinMasterNodes = false, there is no way for the test to
set the list of bootstrapping nodes because node names are not known in
advance. This problem is solved by adding updateNodesSettings method
to NodeConfigurationSource and ESIntegTestCase (which could be
overridden by concrete integration test class). Once we have the list
of settings for all nodes, the integration test class is allowed to
update it. In our case, we update the
ClusterBootrstapService.INITIAL_MASTER_NODES_SETTING setting.
