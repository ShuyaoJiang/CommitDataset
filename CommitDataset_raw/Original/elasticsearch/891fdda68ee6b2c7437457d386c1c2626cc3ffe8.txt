Allow unmapped fields in composite aggregations (#35331)

Today the `composite` aggregation throws an error if a source targets an
unmapped field and `missing_bucket` is set to false. Documents without a
value for a source cannot produce any bucket if `missing_bucket` is not
activated so the error is a shortcut to say that the response will be empty.
However this is not consistent with the `terms` aggregation which accepts
unmapped field by default even if the response is also guaranteed to be empty.
This commit removes this restriction, if a source contains an unmapped field
we now return an empty response (no buckets).

Closes #35317
