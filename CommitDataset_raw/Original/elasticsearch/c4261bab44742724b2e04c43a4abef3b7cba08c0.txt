Add minimal sanity checks to custom/scripted similarities. (#33564)

Add minimal sanity checks to custom/scripted similarities.

Lucene 8 introduced more constraints on similarities, in particular:
 - scores must not be negative,
 - scores must not decrease when term freq increases,
 - scores must not increase when norm (interpreted as an unsigned long)
   increases.

We can't check every single case, but could at least run some sanity checks.
