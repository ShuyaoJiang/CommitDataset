Revert "Adjust CombinedDeletionPolicy for multiple commits (#27456)"

The commit looks harmless, unfortunately it can break the engine flush
scheduler and the translog rolling. Both `uncommittedOperations` and
`uncommittedSizeInBytes` are currently calculated based on the minimum
required generation for recovery rather than the translog generation of
the last index commit. This is not correct if other index commits are
reserved for snapshotting even though we are keeping the last index
commit only.

This reverts commit e95d18ec23e9a25cc4b6b2cc3a665c7e5427c2db.
