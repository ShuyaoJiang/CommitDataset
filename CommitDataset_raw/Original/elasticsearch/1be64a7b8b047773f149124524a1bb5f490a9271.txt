SQL: Fix null handling for AND and OR in SELECT (#35277)

Override `process()` in `BinaryLogicProcessor` which doesn't immediately
return null if left or right argument is null, which is the behaviour of
`process()` of the parent class `BinaryProcessor`.

Also, add more tests for `AND` and `OR` in SELECT clause with literal.

Fixes: #35240
