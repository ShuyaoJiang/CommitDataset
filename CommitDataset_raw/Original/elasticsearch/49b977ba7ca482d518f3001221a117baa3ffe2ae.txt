resolveHasher defaults to NOOP (#31723)

* Default resolveFromHash to Hasher.NOOP

This changes the default behavior when resolving the hashing
algorithm from unrecognised hash strings, which was introduced in
 #31234

A hash string that doesn't start with an algorithm identifier can
either be a malformed/corrupted hash or a plaintext password when
Hasher.NOOP is used(against warnings).
Do not make assumptions about which of the two is true for such
strings and default to Hasher.NOOP. Hash verification will subsequently
fail for malformed hashes.
Finally, do not log the potentially malformed hash as this can very
well be a plaintext password.
