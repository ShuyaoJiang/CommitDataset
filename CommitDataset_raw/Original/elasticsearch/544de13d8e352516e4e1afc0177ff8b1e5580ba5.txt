Disallow negative query boost (#34486)

This change disallows negative query boosts. Negative scores are not allowed in Lucene 8 so
it is easier to just disallow negative boosts entirely. We should also deprecate negative boosts
in 6x in order to ensure that users are aware when they'll upgrade to ES 7.
