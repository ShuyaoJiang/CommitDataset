Avoid NPE in `more_like_this` when field has zero tokens (#30365)

Fixes and edge case when using `more_like_this` where TermVectorsWriter
could throw an NPE when a field produced zero tokens after analysis. This
changes the implementation to use an empty list of tokens in this case.

Closes #30148
