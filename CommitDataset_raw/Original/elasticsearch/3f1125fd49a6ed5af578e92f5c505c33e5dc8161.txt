Recover peers from translog, ignoring soft deletes (#38904)

Today if soft deletes are enabled then we read the operations needed for peer
recovery from Lucene. However we do not currently make any attempt to retain
history in Lucene specifically for peer recoveries so we may discard it and
fall back to a more expensive file-based recovery. Yet we still retain
sufficient history in the translog to perform an operations-based peer
recovery.

In the long run we would like to fix this by retaining more history in Lucene,
possibly using shard history retention leases (#37165). For now, however, this
commit reverts to performing peer recoveries using the history retained in the
translog regardless of whether soft deletes are enabled or not.
