Fix Version based BWC and set correct minCompatVersion (#24732)

Approaching the release of 6.0 we need to sort out the usage of
`Version#minimumCompatibilityVersion` which was still set to 5.0.0.
Now this change moves it to the latest released version of 5.x (5.4 at this point)
to ensure we are compatible with the latest minor of the previous major. This change
also removes all the `_UNRELEASED` from the versions that where released and drops versions
that were never released and are not expected to be released (bugfixes in minors that are not
the latest in the previous major).
