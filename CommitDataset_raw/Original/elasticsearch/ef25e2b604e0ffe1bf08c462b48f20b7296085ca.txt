[ML] When deleting a filter refresh the index immediately (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1587)

Otherwise it's possible that the get_filter endpoint can return a filter that's been
deleted. Although this is the behaviour of the search API, specific metadata
management APIs should provide better guarantees.
