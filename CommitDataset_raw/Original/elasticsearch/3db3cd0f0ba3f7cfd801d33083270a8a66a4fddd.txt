Watcher: Reduce logging noise if no local watcher shards exist (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1846)

Every cluster state update resulted in a log message, that watcher
pauses execution. This has been fixed to only log, if there was an
actual state switch from executing to pausing, but do nothing if
there are no local shards anyway.

This will reduce the logging noise in tests a lot.
