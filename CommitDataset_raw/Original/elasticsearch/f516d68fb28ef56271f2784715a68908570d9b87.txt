Share `NioGroup` between http and transport impls (#37396)

Currently we create dedicated network threads for both the http and
transport implementations. Since these these threads should never
perform blocking operations, these threads could be shared. This commit
modifies the nio-transport to have 0 http workers be default. If the
default configs are used, this will cause the http transport to be run
on the transport worker threads. The http worker setting will still exist
in case the user would like to configure dedicated workers. Additionally,
this commmit deletes dedicated acceptor threads. We have never had these
for the netty transport and they can be added back if a need is
determined in the future.
