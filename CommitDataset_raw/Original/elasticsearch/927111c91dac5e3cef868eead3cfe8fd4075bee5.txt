Remove QueryParseContext from parsing QueryBuilders (#25448)

Currently QueryParseContext is only a thin wrapper around an XContentParser that
adds little functionality of its own. I provides helpers for long deprecated
field names which can be removed and two helper methods that can be made static
and moved to other classes. This is a first step in helping to remove
QueryParseContext entirely.
