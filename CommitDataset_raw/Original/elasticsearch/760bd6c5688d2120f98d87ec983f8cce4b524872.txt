Extend testing of build method in GeoDistanceSortBuilder (#26498)

Improve testing around the GeoDistanceSortBuilder#build method, adding checks for correct
transfers of the sort order, mode, nested sorts and points validation and coercion.

Also changing the behaviour around the nested_path, nested_filter vs. nested parameter in
a similar way as in #26490 and deprecating the setters/getters for the old syntax.

Relates to #17286
