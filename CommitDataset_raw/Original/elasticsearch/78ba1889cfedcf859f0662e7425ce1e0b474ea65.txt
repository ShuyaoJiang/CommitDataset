Replace the TreeMap in the composite aggregation (#36675)

The `composite` aggregation uses a TreeMap to keep track of the best buckets.
This ensures a log(n) time cost to insert new buckets but also to retrieve buckets
that are already present in the map. In order to speed up the retrieval of buckets
this change replaces the TreeMap with a priority queue and a HashMap. The insertion
cost is still log(n) but the retrieval of buckets through the HashMap is now done in constant
time. This optimization can bring significant improvement since each document needs
to check if its associated buckets are already present in the current best buckets.
