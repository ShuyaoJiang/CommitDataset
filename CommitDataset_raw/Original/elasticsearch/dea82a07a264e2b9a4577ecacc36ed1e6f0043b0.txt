Infer KeyStore type from pathname (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2514)

If the keystore type is not explicitly specified, infer it from the filename.
Treats .p12, .pfx and .pkcs12 as being PKCS12, all others as jks.

This will allow certgen to produce PKCSelastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#12 files by default and make it easy to use them as x-pack keystores
