Test: use the same settings object to construct tribe settings

This changes the SecurityTribeIT tests to use the same settings object when creating the settings
for the tribe node. Previously two different objects were being created and we would read regular
settings from one and secure settings from another. This causes problems since randomization means
that there may be settings added on the first call that do not get added on the second call. One
example is the randomization of when to only use a keystore or to use both a keystore and a
truststore. On the first call, we would add settings for both a keystore and a truststore but on
the second call only the keystore settings were added. This lead to failures as we would not be
able to open a password protected truststore since the password was never added to the secure
settings.
