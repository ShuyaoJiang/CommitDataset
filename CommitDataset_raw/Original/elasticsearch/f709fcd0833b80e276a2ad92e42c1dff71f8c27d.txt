Watcher: Refactor/Fix TransportWatcherServiceAction (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4240)

This commit fixes several issues with the current implementation of
starting & stopping watcher

1. The WatcherServiceResponse was always returning a message, that the
   request was acknowledged, completely independent from the fact if it was
   or not.
2. A new cluster state instance was always returned, regardless if the
   state had changed or not (which is explicitely mentioned in the
   javadocs to check for this)
3. The AckedClusterStateUpdateTask now returns a proper WatcherServiceResponse
4. A failure now gets logged

Relates elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4225 (this is just a hunch for now)
