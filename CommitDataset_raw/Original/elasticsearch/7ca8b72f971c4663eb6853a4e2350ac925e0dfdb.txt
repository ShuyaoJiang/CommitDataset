Push runtime Java home through to Gradle

We need to start Gradle on the same JVM as runtime Java home to ensure
that certain tasks (e.g., third party audit) are run on all the flavors
of the JDK that we support (without this change it would only run on the
same JVM as Gradle which would usually be compiler Java home).
