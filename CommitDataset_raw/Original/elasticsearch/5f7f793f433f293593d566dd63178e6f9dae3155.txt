Propagate max_auto_id_timestamp in peer recovery (#33693)

Today we don't store the auto-generated timestamp of append-only
operations in Lucene; and assign -1 to every index operations
constructed from LuceneChangesSnapshot. This looks innocent but it
generates duplicate documents on a replica if a retry append-only
arrives first via peer-recovery; then an original append-only arrives
via replication. Since the retry append-only (delivered via recovery)
does not have timestamp, the replica will happily optimizes the original
request while it should not.

This change transmits the max auto-generated timestamp from the primary
to replicas before translog phase in peer recovery. This timestamp will
prevent replicas from optimizing append-only requests if retry
counterparts have been processed.
