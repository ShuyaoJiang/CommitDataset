SQL: Fix translation to painless for conditionals (#36636)

Add missing `formatTemplate()` for conditional functions which
resulted in incomplete painless script. Moreover the specific
return type of Object in the painless signatures resulted in
casting exceptions when conditional functions are used in the
ORDER BY.
