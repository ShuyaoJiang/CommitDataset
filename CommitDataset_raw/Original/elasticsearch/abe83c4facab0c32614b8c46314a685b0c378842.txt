Fail query when a sort is provided in conjunction with rescorers (#26510)

This change fixes a regression introduced in 6 that removes the skipping of the rescore phase
when a sort other than _score is used.
We now fail the request when a sort is provided in conjunction with rescore instead of just skipping the rescore phase
This commit also adds an assert that checks if the topdocs are sorted by _score after the rescoring.
This is the responsibility of the rescorer to make sure that topdocs are sorted after rescore so we
just check that this condition is met in the rescore phase.
