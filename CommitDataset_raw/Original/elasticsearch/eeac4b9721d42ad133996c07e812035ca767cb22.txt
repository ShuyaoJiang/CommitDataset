Fix Fast Vector Highlighter NPE on match phrase prefix (#25116)

The FVH fails with an NPE when a match phrase prefix is rewritten in an empty phrase query.
This change makes sure that the multi match query rewrites to a MatchNoDocsQuery (instead of an empty phrase query) when there is
a single term and that term does not expand to any term in the index.

Fixes #25088
