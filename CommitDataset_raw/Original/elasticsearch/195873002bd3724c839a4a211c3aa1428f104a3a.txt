ingest: compile mustache template only if field includes '{{'' (#37207)

* ingest: compile mustache template only if field includes '{{''

Prior to this change, any field in an ingest node processor that supports
script templates would be compiled as mustache template regardless if they
contain a template or not. Compiling normal text as mustache templates is
harmless. However, each compilation counts against the script compilation
circuit breaker. A large number of processors without any templates or scripts
could un-intuitively trip the too many script compilations circuit breaker.

This change simple checks for '{{' in the text before it attempts to compile.
