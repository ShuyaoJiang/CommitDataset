[ML] Add field stats to log structure finder (#33351)

The log structure endpoint will return these in addition to
pure structure information so that it can be used to drive
pre-import data visualizer functionality.

The statistics for every field are count, cardinality
(distinct count) and top hits (most common values).  Extra
statistics are calculated if the field is numeric: min, max,
mean and median.
