Set watermarks in single-node test cases

We set the watermarks to low values in other test cases to prevent test
failures on nodes with low disk space (if the disk space is too low, the
test will fail anyway but we should not prematurely fail). This commit
sets the watermarks in the single-node test cases to avoid test failures
in such situations.
