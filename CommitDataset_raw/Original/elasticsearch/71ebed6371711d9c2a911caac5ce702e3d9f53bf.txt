Watcher: Mark watcher as started only after loading watches (#30403)

Starting watcher should wait for the watcher to be started before
marking the status as started, which is now done via a callback.

Also, reloading watcher could set the execution service to paused. This could
lead to watches not being executed, when run in tests. This fix does not
change the paused flag in the execution service, just clears out the
current queue and executions.

Closes #30381
