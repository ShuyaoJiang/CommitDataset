Use system context for cluster state update tasks (#31241)

This commit makes it so that cluster state update tasks always run under the system context, only
restoring the original context when the listener that was provided with the task is called. A notable
exception is the clusterStatePublished(...) callback which will still run under system context,
because it's defined on the executor-level, and not the task level, and only called once for the
combined batch of tasks and can therefore not be uniquely identified with a task / thread context.
