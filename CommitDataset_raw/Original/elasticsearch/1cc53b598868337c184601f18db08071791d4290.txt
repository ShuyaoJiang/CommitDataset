Bad regex in CORS settings should throw a nicer error (#34035)

Currently a bad regex in CORS settings throws a PatternSyntaxException, which
then bubbles up through the bootstrap code, meaning users have to parse a
stack trace to work out where the problem is.  We should instead catch this
exception and rethrow with a more useful error message.
