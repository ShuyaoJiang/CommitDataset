Tests: Do not set number of replicas for watcher index (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3882)

The watcher index uses auto expanding of replicas nowadays, so there is
no need to set the number of replicas.

Also ensuring that all watcher indices are green on startup has been moved
to one call, in order to prevent indices being moved around after adding
the triggered watches or watch history index.
