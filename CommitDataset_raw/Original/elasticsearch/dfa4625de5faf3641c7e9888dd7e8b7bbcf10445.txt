Create ISO8601 joda compatible java time formatter (#38434)

The existing formatter being used was not on par with the joda formatter
as it was missing the ability to parse a comma as a separator between
seconds and milliseconds.

While a real iso8601 would be much more complex, this might be
sufficient for some more use-cases.

The ingest date formatter now also uses the iso8601 formatter by
default.

Closes #38345
