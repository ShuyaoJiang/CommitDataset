Handles exists query in composite aggs (#35758)

This commit adds the support for exists query in the sorted execution mode
of the `composite` aggregation. We'll execute the aggregation from the sorted
points and use early termination if the main query is an `exists` query over the
first source of the `composite` aggregation.
