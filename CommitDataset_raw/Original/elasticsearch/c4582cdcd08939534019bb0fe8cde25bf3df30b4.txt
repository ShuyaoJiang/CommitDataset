Additional settings for SAML NameID policy (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3969)

* Additional settings for SAML NameID policy

We should not be populating SPNameQualifier by default as it is
intended to be used to specify an alternate SP EntityID rather than
our own. Some IdPs (ADFS) fail when presented with this value.

This commit
- makes the SPNameQualifier a setting that defaults to blank
- adds a setting for "AllowCreate"
- documents the above
