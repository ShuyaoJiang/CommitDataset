SQL: Stop serializing errors for CLI and JDBC (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3034)

Now that we can parse Elasticsearch's standard error messages in the CLI
and JDBC client we can just let those standard error messages bubble out
of Elasticsearch rather than catch and encode them.

In a followup we can remove the encoding entirely.
