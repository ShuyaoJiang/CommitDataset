Support configuring license type for gradle run (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3942)

This commit is related to elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3877. It allows the passing of a system
property to gradle run indicating whether a `basic` or `trial` license
should be generated. If the `trial` license is indicated, platinum
features will be enabled.
