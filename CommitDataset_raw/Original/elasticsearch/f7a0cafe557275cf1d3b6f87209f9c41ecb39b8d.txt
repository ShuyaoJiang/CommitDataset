SQL: Fix build on Java 10

Due to a runtime classpath clash, featureAware task was failing on JVMs
higher than 1.8 (since the ASM version from Painless was used instead
which does not recognized Java 9 or 10 bytecode) causing the task to
fail.
This commit excludes the ASM dependency (since it's not used by SQL
itself).
