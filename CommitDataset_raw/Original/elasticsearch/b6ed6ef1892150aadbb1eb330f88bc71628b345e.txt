Add sni name to SSLEngine in nio transport (#35920)

This commit is related to #32517. It allows an "sni_server_name"
attribute on a DiscoveryNode to be propagated to the server using
the TLS SNI extentsion. Prior to this commit, this functionality
was only support for the netty transport. This commit adds this
functionality to the security nio transport.
