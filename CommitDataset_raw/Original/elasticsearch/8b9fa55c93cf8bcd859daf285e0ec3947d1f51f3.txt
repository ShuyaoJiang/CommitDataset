Add storage-layer disruptions to CoordinatorTests (#34347)

Today we assume the storage layer operates perfectly in CoordinatorTests, which
means we are not testing that the system's invariants are preserved if the
storage layer fails for some reason. This change injects (rare) storage-layer
failures during the safety phase to cover these cases.
