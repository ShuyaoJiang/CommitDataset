[test] port archive distribution packaging tests (#31314)

Recreates the rest of the bats packaging tests for the tar distribution
in the java packaging test project, with support for both tar and zip
packaging, both oss and default flavors, and on Linux and Windows. Most
tests are followed fairly closely, some have either been dropped if
unnecessary or folded into others if convenient.
