[ML] Add integration tests to check persistence (#40272)

Additional checks have been added to exercise the behaviour of
persistence on graceful close of an anomaly job. In particular:

 - check that persistence does not occur for a job that is opened and
 then immediately closed, with nothing else having happened.
 - check that persistence occurs on graceful close of a job if it has
 processed data.
 - check that persistence occurs subsequent to time being manually
 advanced - even if no additional data has been seen by the job
 - check the edge case where persistence occurs if a job is opened, time
 is manually advanced and then the job is closed, having seen no data.
