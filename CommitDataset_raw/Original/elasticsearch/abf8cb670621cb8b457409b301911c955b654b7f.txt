[CCR] Cleanup pause follow action (#34183)

* Change the `TransportPauseFollowAction` to extend from `TransportMasterNodeAction`
  instead of `HandledAction`, this removes a sync cluster state api call.
* Introduced `ResponseHandler` that removes duplicated code in `TransportPauseFollowAction` and
  `TransportResumeFollowAction`.
* Changed `PauseFollowAction.Request` to not use `readFrom()`.
