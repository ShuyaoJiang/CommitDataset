Clear send behavior rule in CloseWhileRelocatingShardsIT (#38159)

The current CloseWhileRelocatingShardsIT test adds some "send behavior" 
rule to a target node's mocked transport service in order to detect when shard 
relocating are started. These rules are never cleared and prevent the test to 
complete normally after the rebalance is re-enabled again.

This commit changes the test so that rules are cleared and most verifications 
are done before the rebalance is reenabled again.

Closes #38090
