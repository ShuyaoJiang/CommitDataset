add support for is_write_index in put-alias body parsing (#31674)

* add support for is_write_index in put-alias body parsing

The Rest Put-Alias Action does separate parsing of the alias body
to construct the IndicesAliasesRequest. This extra parsing
was missed in #30703.

* test flag was not just ignored by the parser

* disable backcompat tests
