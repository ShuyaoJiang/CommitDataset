[TEST] Fix TransportReplicationActionTests.testRetryOnReplica for replica request (#24745)

* [TEST] Fix TransportReplicationActionTests.testRetryOnReplica for replica request

We were improperly testing that it was a `ConcreteShardRequest` instead of a
`ConcreteReplicaRequest`. This adds that change and also ensures that the
checkpoint is retrievable from the request.

* Fix line-length
