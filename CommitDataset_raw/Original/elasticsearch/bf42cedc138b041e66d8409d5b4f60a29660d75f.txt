Clarify the order of responses to a bulk request (#36441)

Bulk requests comprise many individual actions, and the responses for each
action comes back in the same order (see e.g. `DocumentActionsIT#testBulk()`).
However the docs do not seem to explicitly state this vital fact. This commit
addresses that omission.
