Rewrite search requests on the coordinating nodes (#25814)

This change rewrites search requests on the coordinating node before
we send requests to the individual shards. This will reduce the rewrite load
and object creation for each rewrite on the executing nodes and will fetch
resources only once instead of N times once per shard for queries like `terms`
query with index lookups. (among percolator and geo-shape)
