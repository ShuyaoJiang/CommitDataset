Push primary term to replication tracker (#38044)

This commit pushes the primary term into the replication tracker. This
is a precursor to using the primary term to resolving ordering problems
for retention leases. Namely, it can be that out-of-order retention
lease sync requests arrive on a replica. To resolve this, we need a
tuple of (primary term, version). For this to be, the primary term needs
to be accessible in the replication tracker. As the primary term is part
of the replication group anyway, this change conceptually makes sense.
