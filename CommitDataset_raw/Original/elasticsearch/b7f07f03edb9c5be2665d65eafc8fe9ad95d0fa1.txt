[Rollup] Use composite's missing_bucket (#31402)

We can leverage the composite agg's new `missing_bucket` feature on
terms groupings.  This means the aggregation criteria used in the indexer
will now return null buckets for missing keys.  

Because all buckets are now returned (even if a key is null),
we can guarantee correct doc counts with
"combined" jobs (where a job rolls up multiple schemas).  This was
previously impossible since composite would ignore documents that
didn't have _all_ the keys, meaning non-overlapping schemas would
cause composite to return no buckets.

Note: date_histo does not use `missing_bucket`, since a timestamp is
always required.

The docs have been adjusted to recommend a single, combined job.  It
also makes reference to the previous issue to help users that are upgrading
(rather than just deleting the sections).
