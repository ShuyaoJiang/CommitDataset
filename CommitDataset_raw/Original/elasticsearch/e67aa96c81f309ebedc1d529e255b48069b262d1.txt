Core: Combine Action and GenericAction (#31405)

Since #30966, Action no longer has anything but a call to the
GenericAction super constructor. This commit renames GenericAction
into Action, thus eliminating the Action class. Additionally, this
commit removes the Request generic parameter of the class, since
it was unused.
