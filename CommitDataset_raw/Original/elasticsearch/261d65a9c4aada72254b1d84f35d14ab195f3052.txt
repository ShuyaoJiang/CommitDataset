[ML] add meta data field into mappings and update procedure (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1925)

Adds a update procedure for ML index mappings in order to allow adding new fields. The ES version is stored in the "_meta" field of the ML mappings which then get applied to every index. When opening a job, this version is checked on the (shared) index and a mapping update is performed in case that the version is older than current.
