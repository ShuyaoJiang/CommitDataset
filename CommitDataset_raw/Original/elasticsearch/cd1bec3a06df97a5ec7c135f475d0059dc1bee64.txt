[refactor] add Environment in BootstrapContext (#36573)

There are certain BootstrapCheck checks that may need access environment-specific
values. Watcher's EncryptSensitiveDataBootstrapCheck passes in the node's environment
via a constructor to bypass the shortcoming in BootstrapContext. This commit
pulls in the node's environment into BootstrapContext.

Another case is found in #36519, where it is useful to check the state of the
data-path. Since PathUtils.get and Paths.get are forbidden APIs, we rely on
the environment to retrieve references to things like node data paths.

This means that the BootstrapContext will have the same Settings used in the
Environment, which currently differs from the Node's settings.
