[Tests] Ensure that Watcher templates are created before creating alias (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3956)

* [Tests] Ensure that Watcher templates are created before creating alias

The createWatcherIndicesOrAliases() method randomly created watcher
indices with or without aliases. On slow machines it is possible that
the indices get created before WatcherIndexTemplateRegistry put the
templates. When it happens, the indices will be created without the
right index.format value, preventing the WatcherService to start (as
it checks the index.format before starting, in case an upgrade is
required)
