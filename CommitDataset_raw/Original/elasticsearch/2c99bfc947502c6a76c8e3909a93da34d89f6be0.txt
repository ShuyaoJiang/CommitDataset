REST high-level client: Fix parsing of script fields (#28395)

Script fields can get a bit more complicated than just stored fields. A script can return null, an object and also an array. Extended parsing to support such valid values. Also renamed util method from `parseStoredFieldsValue` to `parseFieldsValue` given that it can parse stored fields but also script fields, anything that's returned as `fields`.

Closes #28380
