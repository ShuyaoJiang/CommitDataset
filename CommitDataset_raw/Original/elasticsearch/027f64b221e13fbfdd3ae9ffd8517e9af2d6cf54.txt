[ML] Fix a race condition simultaneous close requests are made for a job (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2913)

When simultaneous close requests were made for the same job it was possible
that one of the requests would inappropriately log error messages about the
job having failed.  This change prevents that problem, whilst continuing to
adhere to the requirement that close requests for already closing jobs do not
return until the close request that is doing the work completes.
