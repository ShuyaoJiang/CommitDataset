[Test] Re-Add integer_range and date_range field types for query builder tests (#28171)

The tests for those field types were removed in #26549 because the range mapper
was moved to a module, but later this mapper was moved back to core in #27854.
This change adds back those two field types like before to the general setup in
AbstractQueryTestCase and adds some specifics to the RangeQueryBuilder and
TermsQueryBuilder tests. Also adding back an integration test in SearchQueryIT that
has been removed before but that can be kept with the mapper back in core now.

Relates to #28147
