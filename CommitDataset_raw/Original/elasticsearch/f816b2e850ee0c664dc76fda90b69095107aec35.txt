Monitoring: Move watcher tests for repository split preparations (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3183)

Created a smoke-test-monitoring-with-watcher project that runs REST
tests with watcher enabled to ensure that the proper watcher are
installed either when the local or the HTTP exporter are set up.

Also removed two more watcher imports in the tests.

Relates elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2925
