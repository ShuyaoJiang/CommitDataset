Move repository-gcs fixture test to QA project (#30208)

Similarly to what has been done in for the repository-s3 plugin, 
this commit moves the fixture test into a dedicated 
repository-gcs/qa/google-cloud-storage project.

It also exposes some environment variables which allows to 
execute the integration tests against the real Google Cloud 
Storage service. When the environment variables are not 
defined, the integration tests are executed using the fixture 
added in #28788. Related to #29349.
