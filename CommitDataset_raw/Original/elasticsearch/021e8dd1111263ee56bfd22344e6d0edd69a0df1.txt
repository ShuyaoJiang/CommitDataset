SQL: Don't put aggs only queries into scroll context

SQL was adding scroll timeouts to aggregation only queries. At best this
is just confusing because we never scroll these queries. It *might*
leave behind a scroll context that we don't want. It is failing some new
validation that says that we have to have a `size` for every scroll
query.

Anyway, the simplest thing to do is to not put a scroll on aggregation
only queries.
