Improve test times for tests using `RandomObjects::addFields` (#31556)

Currently RandomObjects::addFields can potentially generate a large number of fields This commit decreases the chances that a new object or array is added as a new branch of an object, which lowers the probability of ending up with very big documents generated. It also reduces the number of documents generated for the SimulatePipelineResponseTests from 10 to 5 to reduce the testing time required for parsing.
