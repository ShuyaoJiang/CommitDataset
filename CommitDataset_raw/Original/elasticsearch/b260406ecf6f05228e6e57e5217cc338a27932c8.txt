ILM: use node _id attribute when allocating to one node (#35061)

ILM's Shrink Action was using a nodes "_name" attribute to
allocate to prepare for the shrink step. Since the name is
configurable by a user and may use the same name for
multiple nodes on one machine, _id is safer since it is guaranteed
to be unique.

closes #35043.
