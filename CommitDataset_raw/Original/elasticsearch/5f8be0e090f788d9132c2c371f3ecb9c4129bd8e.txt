Introduce NioTransport into framework for testing (#24262)

This commit introduces a nio based tcp transport into framework for
testing.

Currently Elasticsearch uses a simple blocking tcp transport for
testing purposes (MockTcpTransport). This diverges from production
where our current transport (netty) is non-blocking.

The point of this commit is to introduce a testing variant that more
closely matches the behavior of production instances.
