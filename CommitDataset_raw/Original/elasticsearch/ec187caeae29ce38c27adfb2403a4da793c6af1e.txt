[Test] Fix CRUDDocumentationIT (#28457)

Similarly to other documentation tests in the high level client, the
asynchronous operation like update, index or delete can make the test
fail if it sneak in between the middle of another operation.

This commit moves the async doc tests to be the last ones executed and
adds assert busy loops to ensure that the asynchronous operations are
correctly terminated.
