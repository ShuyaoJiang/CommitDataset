Node selector per client rather than per request (#31471)

We have made node selectors configurable per request, but all 
of other language clients don't allow for that.
A good reason not to do so, is that having a different node selector 
per request breaks round-robin. This commit makes NodeSelector 
configurable only at client initialization. It also improves the docs 
on this matter, important given that a single node selector can still 
affect round-robin.
