Add Checks for Closed Channel in Selector Loop (#39096)

* A few warnings could be observed in test logs about `NoSuchElementException` being thrown in `InboundChannelBuffer#sliceBuffersTo`.
These were the result of calls to this method after the relevant channel and hence the buffer was closed already as a result of a failed IO operation.
  * Fixed by adding the necessary guard statements to break out in these cases. I don't think there is a need here to do any additional error handling since `eventHandler.postHandling(channelContext);` at the end of the `processKey`
call in the main selection loop handles closing channels and invoking callbacks for writes that failed to go through already.
