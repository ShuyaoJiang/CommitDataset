Tests: Add checks to GeoDistanceQueryBuilderTests (#34273)

Adds checks for parsed geo distance query. It is a bit hack-ish since it
compares with query's toString() output, but it is better than no
checks. The parsed query itself has default visibility, so we cannot
access it here unless we move the test to org.apache.lucene.document
package.

Fixes #34043
