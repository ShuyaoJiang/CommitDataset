SQL: Fix issue with wrong data type for scripted Grouping keys (#35969)

When the grouping key of a GROUP BY is a painless script (functions are
involved), the data type of the key was incorrect in certain cases
(Boolean, IP, Date). This resulted in returning wrong data type for this
columns in the query results. E.g.:

```
SELECT COUNT(*), a > 10 AS a FROM t GROUP BY a
```

Fixes: #35662
