Add settings updater for 2 affix settings (#33050)

Today we can only have non-affix settings updated and consumed _together_.
Yet, there are use-cases where two affix settings depend on each other which
makes using the hard without consuming updates together. Unfortunately, there is
not straight forward way to have N settings updated together in a type-safe way
having 2 still serves a large portion of use-cases.
