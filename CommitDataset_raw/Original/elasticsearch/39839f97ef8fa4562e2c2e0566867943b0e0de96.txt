TEST: Access cluster state directly in assertSeqNos (#33277)

Some AbstractDisruptionTestCase tests start failing since we enabled
assertSeqNos (in #33130). They fail because the assertSeqNos assertion
queries cluster stats while the cluster is disrupted or not formed yet.

This commit switches to use the cluster state and shard stats directly
from the test cluster.

Closes #33251
