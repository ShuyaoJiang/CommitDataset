[DOCS] reworded to prevent code span rendering glitch (#25442)

Changed `rescore`s to `rescore` requests as an backtick followed by the s character appears to be interpreted as an apostrophe  which then leads to an unbalanced backtick for the next code span in the remainder of the paragraph

Closes #25443
