[Zen2] Reduce cluster scope in NodeDisconnectIT (#36168)

This test suite can stop all the shared master-eligible nodes, which breaks the
cluster since any non-shared master-eligible nodes are stopped first in the
reset process between tests.

Since this test suite can leave the cluster in this somewhat broken state, it
seems best that it uses a new cluster for each test.
