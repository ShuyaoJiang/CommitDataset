Deprecate `_type` in simulate pipeline requests (#37949)

As mapping types are being removed throughout Elasticsearch, the use of
`_type` in pipeline simulation requests is deprecated. Additionally, the
default `_type` used if one is not supplied has been changed to `_doc` for
consistency with the rest of Elasticsearch.
