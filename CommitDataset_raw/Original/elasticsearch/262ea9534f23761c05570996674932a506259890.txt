Make locale parsing less lenient. (#26361)

The `locale` field of `date` fields accepts almost any string and unknown
locales are simply ignored, which is trappy. We should fail on unknown languages
or countries.

This commit also makes `-` an accepted separator in addition to `_` since `-`
is the recommended separator (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646#section-2.1).
`_` is probably still worth supporting since it is the separator used by
`Locale#toString()`.
