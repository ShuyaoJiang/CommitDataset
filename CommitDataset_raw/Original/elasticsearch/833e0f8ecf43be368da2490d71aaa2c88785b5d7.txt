Prevent throttled indices to be searched through wildcards by default (#34354)

Today if a wildcard, date-math expression or alias expands/resolves
to an index that is search-throttled we still search it. This is likely
not the desired behavior since it can unexpectedly slow down searches
significantly.

This change adds a new indices option that allows `search`, `count`
and `msearch` to ignore throttled indices by default. Users can
force expansion to throttled indices by using `ignore_throttled=true`
on the rest request to expand also to throttled indices.
