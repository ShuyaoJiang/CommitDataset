Fix default value of ignore_unavailable for snapshot REST API (#27056)

The default value for ignore_unavailable did not match what was documented when using the REST APIs for snapshot creation and restore. This commit sets the default value of ignore_unavailable to false, the way it is documented and ensures it's the same when using either REST API or transport client.

Closes #25359
