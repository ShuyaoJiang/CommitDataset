Fix test failures related to file corruption (#36530)

* Fix CorruptFileIT to also take last DV generation into account

We currently only prune old .liv generations. With soft_deletes it's important
to also prune DV generations.

* Fix CorruptionUtils to skip the footer bytes after the checksum is read.

Today we read a broken checksum since we also checksum the 8 footer bytes that include
the checksum algorithm and the footer magic.

Closes #36526
