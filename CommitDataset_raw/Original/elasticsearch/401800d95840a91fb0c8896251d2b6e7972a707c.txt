Core: Remove index name resolver from base TransportAction (#31002)

Most transport actions don't need to resolve index names. This commit
removes the index name resolver as a super constructor parameter for
TransportAction. The actions that do need the resolver then have a
member added to keep the resolver from their own constructor.
