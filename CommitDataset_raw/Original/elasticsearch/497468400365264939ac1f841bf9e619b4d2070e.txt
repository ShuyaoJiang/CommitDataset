 Add tool elasticsearch-node unsafe-bootstrap (#37696)

elasticsearch-node tool helps to restore cluster if half or more of
master eligible nodes are lost. Of course, all bets are off, regarding
data consistency.

There are two parts of the tool: unsafe-bootstrap to be used when there
is still at least one master-eligible node alive and detach-cluster,
when there are no master-eligible nodes left.
This commit implements the first part.

Docs for the tool will be added separately as a part of #37812.
