Watcher: Stop swallowing exceptions, always return them instead of message (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1933)

It is really hard to debug some issues with watcher, when only the
e.getMessage() is returned as failure reasons instead of the whole
stack trace.

This commit gets rid of ExceptionsHelper.detailedMessage(e) and always
returns the whole exception.

This commit also extends the watch history to have all fields named
error be treated like an object to be sure they do not get
indexed. No matter where it's placed in the hierarchy

In addition a few Field interface classes were removed, that only contained parse fields.
