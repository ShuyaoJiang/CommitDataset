Upgrade API: upgrade assistance shouldn't throw 404 on an empty cluster (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1997)

When a user asks for upgrade information for all indices and there are no indices in the cluster, upgrade assistance should just return an empty response indicating that no indices require upgrade or reindexing. This commit also reverts the temporary fix in WatchBackwardsCompatibilityIT tests that was added as a workaround for this issue.
