Settings: Reimplement keystore format to use FIPS compliant algorithms (#28255)

This commit switches the internal format of the elasticsearch keystore
to no longer use java's KeyStore class, but instead encrypt the binary
data of the secrets using AES-GCM. The cipher key is generated using
PBKDF2WithHmacSHA512. Tests are also added for backcompat reading the v1
and v2 formats.
