Allow BWC Testing against a specific branch (#25510)

Some times we need a fix / change to have two parts in two different branches (corresponding to two different ES releases). In order to be able to test these cases you need to run the BWC tests against a local branch rather than then using a branch from `github.com/elastic/elasticsearch`.

This commit adds a system property called `tests.bwc.refspec` that allows you to do it. Note that I've chosen to go with the simplest code change for now, at the expense of some user friendliness.
