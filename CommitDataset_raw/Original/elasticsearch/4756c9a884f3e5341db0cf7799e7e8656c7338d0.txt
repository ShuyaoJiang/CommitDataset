Fix nested query highlighting (#26305)

This commit extracts the inner query in the ESToParentBlockJoinQuery for highlighting.
This query has been added in 5.4 and breaks plain highlighting on nested queries.
Highlighters that use postings or term vectors are not affected because they can't highlight nested documents correctly.
