Use external version type for history ops from Lucene (#31568)

Today we use INTERNAL version type for the history operations from
Lucene index. However, this does not cover the case in which the
original operation has the version type EXTERNAL and version number 0.
Semantically all operations from translog or Lucene should always use
EXTERNAL version type.
