Fix routing with leading or trailing whitespace

The problem here is that splitting was using a method that intentionally
trims whitespace (the method is really meant to be used for splitting
parameters where whitespace should be trimmed like list
settings). However, for routing values whitespace should not be trimmed
because we allow routing with leading and trailing spaces. This commit
switches the parsing of these routing values to a method that does not
trim whitespace.
