Build: Group archive and package distribution projects (#28673)

This commit adds intermediate gradle projects for archive based
distributions (zip, tar) and package based distributions (rpm, deb). The
grouping allows the common distribution build file to be considerably
shorter and clearly separated from the common zip/tar and rpm/deb
configuration.
