Fix #38623 remove xpack namespace REST API (#38625)

* Fix #38623 remove xpack namespace REST API

Except for xpack.usage and xpack.info API's, this moves the last remaining API's out of the xpack namespace

* rename xpack api's inside inside the files as well

* updated yaml tests references to xpack namespaces api's

* update callsApi calls in the IT subclasses

* make sure docs testing does not use xpack namespaced api's

* fix leftover xpack namespaced method names in docs/build.gradle

* found another leftover reference
