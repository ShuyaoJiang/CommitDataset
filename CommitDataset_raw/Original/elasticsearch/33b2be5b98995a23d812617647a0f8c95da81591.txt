Copy retention leases when trim unsafe commits (#37995)

When a primary shard is recovered from its store, we trim the last
commit (when it's unsafe). If that primary crashes before the recovery
completes, we will lose the committed retention leases because they are
baked in the last commit. With this change, we copy the retention leases
from the last commit to the safe commit when trimming unsafe commits.
