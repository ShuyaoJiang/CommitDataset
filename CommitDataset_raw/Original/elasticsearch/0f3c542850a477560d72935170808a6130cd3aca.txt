Deprecate xpack.watcher.history.cleaner_service.enabled (#37782)

This deprecates the `xpack.watcher.history.cleaner_service.enabled` setting,
since all newly created `.watch-history` indices in 7.0 will use ILM to manage
their retention.

In 8.0 the setting itself and cleanup actions will be removed.

Resolves #32041
