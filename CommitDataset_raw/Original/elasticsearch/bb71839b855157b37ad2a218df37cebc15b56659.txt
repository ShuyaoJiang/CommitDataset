Build: Switch ml snapshot dependency to a local project (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1559)

This commit adds an internal project call ml-cpp-snapshot which when
built will pull the ml cpp zip file from the prelert bucket. The GET
request has retries added to handle the dynamic aws creds eventual
consistency.
