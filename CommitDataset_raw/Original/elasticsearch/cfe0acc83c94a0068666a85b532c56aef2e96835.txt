separate out IndexLifecycleService cluster-state change concerns (#33033)

Changes to the IndexLifecycleService were necessary since relying on
ClusterChangedEvents for a full picture of the cluster state's settings was
a mistake. It is not necessary that these events hold all settings, especially ones
that are set at node start-up.

Changes to main include:

- move poll interval updates to a SettingsUpdateConsumer
- move scheduler start/stop to a localMasterNodeListener
- keep triggerPolicies in clusterChanged

Changes to tests include:

- removal of some low-level state transition checks in the Service that no longer make sense
  since the changes are unconditionally specified in the appropriate listeners
- add integration tests for poll-interval updates
- add integration test assertions for verifying scheduler is started up correctly
