percolator: Store the QueryBuilder's Writable representation instead of its XContent representation.

The Writeble representation is less heavy to parse and that will benefit percolate performance and throughput.

The query builder's binary format has now the same bwc guarentees as the xcontent format.

Added a qa test that verifies that percolator queries written in older versions are still readable by the current version.
