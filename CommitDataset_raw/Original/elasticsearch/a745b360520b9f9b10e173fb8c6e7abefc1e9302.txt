Avoid using TimeWarp in TransformIntegrationTests. (#39277)

This commit makes `TransformIntegrationTests` into a standard integration test, as
opposed to using `TimeWarp`, which registers the mock component
`ScheduleEngineTriggerMock` to trigger watches.

The simplification may help with flakiness we've observed `TimeWarp, as in #37882.
