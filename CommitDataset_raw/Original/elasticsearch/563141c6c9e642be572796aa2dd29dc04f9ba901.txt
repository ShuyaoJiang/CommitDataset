Upgrade to Netty 4.1.25.Final (#31232)

This commit upgrades us to Netty 4.1.25. This upgrade is more
challenging than past upgrades, all because of a new object cleaner
thread that they have added. This thread requires an additional security
permission (set context class loader, needed to avoid leaks in certain
scenarios). Additionally, there is not a clean way to shutdown this
thread which means that the thread can fail thread leak control during
tests. As such, we have to filter this thread from thread leak control.
