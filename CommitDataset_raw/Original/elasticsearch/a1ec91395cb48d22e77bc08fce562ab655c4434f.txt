Changed CCR internal integration tests to use a leader and follower cluster instead of a single cluster (#34344)

The `AutoFollowTests` needs to restart the clusters between each tests, because
it is using auto follow stats in assertions. Auto follow stats are only reset
by stopping the elected master node.

Extracted the `testGetOperationsBasedOnGlobalSequenceId()` test to its own test, because it just tests the shard changes api.

* Renamed AutoFollowTests to AutoFollowIT, because it is an integration test.
Renamed ShardChangesIT to IndexFollowingIT, because shard changes it the name
of an internal api and isn't a good name for an integration test.

* move creation of NodeConfigurationSource to a seperate method

* Fixes issues after merge, moved assertSeqNos() and assertSameDocIdsOnShards() methods from ESIntegTestCase to InternalTestCluster, so that ccr tests can use these methods too.
