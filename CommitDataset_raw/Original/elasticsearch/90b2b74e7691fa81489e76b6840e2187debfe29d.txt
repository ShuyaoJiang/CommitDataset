[ML] Tolerate a body without timestamp for get_buckets with a timestamp (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2640)

When getting a single bucket, the get_buckets API can take a timestamp
either in the body or in the URL.  Prior to this change, if a timestamp
was specified in the URL but a body not containing a timestamp was specified
(either empty or containing other parameters like exclude_interim or sort)
then it would cause a bad_request exception.  This in turn causes problems
for clients that cannot send a body when GETting and always send a body when
POSTing.

This change fixes get_buckets to always read any timestamp in the URL, even
when a body is sent.
