[ML] Don't mention unrelated indices when deleting job index aliases (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3160)

This change fixes a problem that would cause job deletion to fail if ANY
index had a block on it, e.g. read-only.

The problem was that we were requesting the job aliases be deleted from
ALL indices in the system due to a misunderstanding with the format of the
get_aliases response.  This didn't usually cause any noticable effects, as
only the ML indices would have the aliases.  But in the case of a read-only
index it would cause an error, leading to unnecessary failure of the job
deletion.

Fixes elastic/machine-learning-cpp#428
