Load bootstrap elastic user password from keystore (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1942)

This is related to elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1217. This commit adds a ClusterStateListener at
node startup. Once the cluster and security index are ready, this
listener will attempt to set the elastic user's password with the
bootstrap password pulled from the keystore. If the password is not in
the keystore or the elastic password has already been set, nothing will
be done.
