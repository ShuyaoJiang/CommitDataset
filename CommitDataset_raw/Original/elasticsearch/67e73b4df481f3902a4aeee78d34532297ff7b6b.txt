 Combine accepting selector and socket selector (#31115)

This is related to #27260. This commit combines the AcceptingSelector
and SocketSelector classes into a single NioSelector. This change
allows the same selector to handle both server and socket channels. This
is valuable as we do not necessarily want a dedicated thread running for
accepting channels.

With this change, this commit removes the configuration for dedicated
accepting selectors for the normal transport class. The accepting
workload for new node connections is likely low, meaning that there is
no need to dedicate a thread to this process.
