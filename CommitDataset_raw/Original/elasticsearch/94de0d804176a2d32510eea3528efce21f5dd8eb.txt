Replace exception catching with fancy returns (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2454)

Instead of throwing and catching an exception for invalid
indices this returns *why* they are invalid in a convenient
object form that can be thrown as an exception when the index
is required or the entire index can be ignored when listing
indices.
