Zen2ify RareClusterStateIT (#38184)

In Zen 1 there are commit timeout and publish timeout and these
settings could be changed on-the-fly.

In Zen 2, there is only commit timeout and this setting is static.
RareClusterStateIT is actively using these settings and the fact, they
are dynamic.

This commit adds cancelCommitedPublication method to Coordinator to
be used by tests. This method will cancel current committed publication
if there is any.
When there is BlockClusterStateProcessing on the non-master node, the
publication will be accepted and committed, but not yet applied. So we
can use the method above to cancel it.

Also, this commit replaces callback + AtomicReference with ActionFuture,
which makes test code easier to read.
