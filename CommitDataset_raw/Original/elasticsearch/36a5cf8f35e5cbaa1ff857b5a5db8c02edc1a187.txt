Automatically early terminate search query based on index sorting (#24864)

This commit refactors the query phase in order to be able
to automatically detect queries that can be early terminated.
If the index sort matches the query sort, the top docs collection is early terminated
on each segment and the computing of the total number of hits that match the query is delegated to a simple TotalHitCountCollector.
This change also adds a new parameter to the search request called `track_total_hits`.
It indicates if the total number of hits that match the query should be tracked.
If false, queries sorted by the index sort will not try to compute this information and 
and will limit the collection to the first N documents per segment.
Aggregations are not impacted and will continue to see every document
even when the index sort matches the query sort and `track_total_hits` is false.
