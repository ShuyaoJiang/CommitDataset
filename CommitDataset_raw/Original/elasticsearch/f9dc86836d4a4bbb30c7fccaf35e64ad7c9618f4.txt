Docs: Test examples that recreate lang analyzers  (#29535)

We have a pile of documentation describing how to rebuild the built in
language analyzers and, previously, our documentation testing framework
made sure that the examples successfully built *an* analyzer but they
didn't assert that the analyzer built by the documentation matches the
built in anlayzer. Unsuprisingly, some of the examples aren't quite
right.

This adds a mechanism that tests that the analyzers built by the docs.
The mechanism is fairly simple and brutal but it seems to be working:
build a hundred random unicode sequences and send them through the
`_analyze` API with the rebuilt analyzer and then again through the
built in analyzer. Then make sure both APIs return the same results.
Each of these calls to `_anlayze` takes about 20ms on my laptop which
seems fine.
