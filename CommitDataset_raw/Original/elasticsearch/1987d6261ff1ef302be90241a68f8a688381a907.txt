Do not fail snapshot when deleting a missing snapshotted file (#30332)

When deleting or creating a snapshot for a given shard, elasticsearch 
usually starts by listing all the existing snapshotted files in the repository. 
Then it computes a diff and deletes the snapshotted files that are not 
needed anymore. During this deletion, an exception is thrown if the file 
to be deleted does not exist anymore.

This behavior is challenging with cloud based repository implementations 
like S3 where a file that has been deleted can still appear in the bucket for 
few seconds/minutes (because the deletion can take some time to be fully 
replicated on S3). If the deleted file appears in the listing of files, then the 
following deletion will fail with a NoSuchFileException and the snapshot 
will be partially created/deleted.

This pull request makes the deletion of these files a bit less strict, ie not 
failing if the file we want to delete does not exist anymore. It introduces a 
new BlobContainer.deleteIgnoringIfNotExists() method that can be used 
at some specific places where not failing when deleting a file is 
considered harmless.
