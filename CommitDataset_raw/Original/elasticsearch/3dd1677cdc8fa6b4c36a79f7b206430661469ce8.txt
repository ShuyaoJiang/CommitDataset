[Test] Fix DuelScrollIT#testDuelIndexOrderQueryThenFetch

This commit disables the automatic `refresh_interval` in order to ensure
that index readers cannot differ between the normal and scroll search.
This issue is related to the 7.5 Lucene upgrade which contains a change that
makes single segment merge more likely to occur (max deletes percentage).

Closes #32682
