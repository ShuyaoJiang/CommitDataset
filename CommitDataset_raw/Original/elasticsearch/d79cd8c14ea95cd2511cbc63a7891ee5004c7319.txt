Use any index specified by .watches for Watcher (#39541)

Previously, Watcher only attached its listener to indices that started
with the prefix `.watches`, which causes Watcher to silently fail to
schedule newly created Watches if the `.watches` alias is redirected to
an index that does not start with `.watches`.

Watcher now attaches the listener to all indices, so that Watcher can
respond to changes in which index has the `.watches` alias.

Also adjusts the tests to randomly use non-prefixed concrete indices for .watches and .triggered_watches.
