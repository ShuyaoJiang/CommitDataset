[ML] Write updated model snapshot to its original index (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1415)

When we update a model snapshot we need to write it back to
the exact index where we read it from. This is necessary
for rollover as otherwise we would end up with two different
versions of the same snapshot.
