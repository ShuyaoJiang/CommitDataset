Tests: Various watcher test improvements

* Reduced a longish timeout to a shorter one, as a watch should be
  executed in a HTTP test.
* Ensured that the TimeThrottleIntegration tests only query for own
  watches in the watch history, also use random names for watch ids
* HipChatServiceTests configured deprecated logging package, so it was
  not possible to follow the HTTP calls to the hipchat service endpoint.
