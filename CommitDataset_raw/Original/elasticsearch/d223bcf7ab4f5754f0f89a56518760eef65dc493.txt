Add the `include_type_name` option to the search and document APIs. (#29506)

This commit add the `include_type_name` option to the `index`, `update`,
`delete`, `get`, `bulk` and `search` APIs. When set to `false`, the response
will omit the `_type` in the response. This option doesn't work if the endpoint
contains a type. For instance, the following call would succeed:

```
GET index/_doc/1?include_type_name=false
```

But the following one would fail:

```
GET index/some_type/1?include_type_name=false
```
