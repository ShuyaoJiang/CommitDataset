SQL: Throw exceptions on errors (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3066)

Instead of returning "error response" objects and then translating them
into SQL exceptions this just throws the SQL exceptions directly. This
means the CLI catches exceptions and prints out the messages which isn't
ideal if this were hot code but it isn't and this is a much simpler way
of doing things.
