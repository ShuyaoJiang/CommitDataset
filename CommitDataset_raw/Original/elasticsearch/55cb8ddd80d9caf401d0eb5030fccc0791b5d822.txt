Do not set data paths on no local storage required

Today when configuring the data paths for the environment, we set data
paths to either the specified path.data or default to data relative to
the Elasticsearch home. Yet if node.local_storage is false, data paths
do not even make sense. In this case, we should reject if path.data is
set, and instead of defaulting data paths to data relative to home, we
should set this to empty paths. This commit does this.
