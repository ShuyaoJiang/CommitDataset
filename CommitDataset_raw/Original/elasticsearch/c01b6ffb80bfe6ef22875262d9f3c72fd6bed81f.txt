CRUD: Fix wait for refresh tests (#33973)

When we implemented `refresh=wait_for` I added a test with the wrong
name. This caused us to not run it. The test asserted that running
several operations with `refresh=wait_for` did not fail if the index was
`_close`d while the operations were waiting. But to be honest, failure
here isn't that bad. The index being waited on is closed. You can't do
anything with it any way. The most important thing is actually that
these operations don't hang forever. Because hanging forever means that
the resources used by the operations aren't freed.

Anyway, when I noticed the error I reenabled the test. But they don't
pass consistently because *sometimes* the operations being tested fail.
They don't seem to hang and they always fail with "this index is closed
so you can't do anything with it" sorts of messages.

When the test started failing we disabled it again. This reenables the
test but causes it to ignore these "index is closed" failures. We'd
prefer they not happen at all but in the grand scheme of things they are
fine and making sure these operations don't hang is much more important.

This also updates the test to bring it more in line with my current
understanding of the "right" way to use the low level rest client.
