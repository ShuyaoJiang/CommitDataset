Use removeTask instead of finishTask in PersistentTasksClusterService (#29055)

The method `PersistentTasksClusterService.finishTask()` has been
modified since it was added and does not use any `removeOncompletion`
flag anymore. Its behavior is now similar to `removeTask()` and can be
replaced by this one. When a non existing task is removed, the cluster
state update task will fail and its `source` will still indicate
`finish persistent task`/`remove persistent task`.
