[TEST] Split tests and skip file permission test on Windows (#32781)

Changes to split tests for keytab file test cases instead of
randomized testing for testing branches in the code in the
same test.
On windows platform, for keytab file permission test, we
required additional security permissions for the test
framework. As this was the only test that required those
permissions, skipping that test on windows platform.
The same scenario gets tested in *nix environments.
