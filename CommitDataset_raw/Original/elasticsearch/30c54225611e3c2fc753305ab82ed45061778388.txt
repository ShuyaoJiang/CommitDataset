Move XContent generation to HasPrivilegesResponse (#35616)

The RestHasPrivilegesAction previously handled its own XContent
generation. This change moves that into HasPrivilegesResponse and
makes the response implement ToXContent.

This allows HasPrivilegesResponseTests to be used to test
compatibility between HLRC and X-Pack internals.

A serialization bug (cluster privs) was also fixed here.
