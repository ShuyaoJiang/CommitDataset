Adapt indices resolution to new ignoreAliases index option (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1622)

ignoreAliases allows to resolve index expressions against concrete indices only, rather than against indices and aliases. It is used for now only in IndicesAliasesRequest and the indices resolution code in the security plugin needs to be adapted accordingly.
