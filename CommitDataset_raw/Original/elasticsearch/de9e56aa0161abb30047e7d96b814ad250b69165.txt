DOC: Add examples to the SQL docs (#31633)

Significantly improve the example snippets in the documentation.
The examples are part of the test suite and checked nightly.
To help readability, the existing dataset was extended (test_emp renamed
to emp plus library).
Improve output of JDBC tests to be consistent with the CLI
Add lenient flag to JDBC asserts to allow type widening (a long is
equivalent to a integer as long as the value is the same).
