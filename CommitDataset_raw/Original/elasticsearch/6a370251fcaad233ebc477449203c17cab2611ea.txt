Improves handling of exceptions in Index Lifecycle (#3511)

* Improves handling of exceptions in Index Lifecycle

This change improves a few different aspects:

* If an exception occurs executing the lifecycle of one index it is caught, logged and other indexes are still processed
* If the lifecycle policy specified in the settings does not exist an error is logged
* Fixes the exception when the delete action is run which occurs because Phase attempts to update the phase and action settings for the deleted index. A `LifecycleAction.indexSurvives()` method is introduced which defaults to `true` but can be overridden to indicate whether the index survives following completion of the action.

* Adds test
