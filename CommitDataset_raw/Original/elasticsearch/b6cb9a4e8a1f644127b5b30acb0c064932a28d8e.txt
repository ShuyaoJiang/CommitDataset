Fix checkpoints advance test

This commit fixes an issue in the checkpoints advance test. Namely, when
there zero documents indexed, after the global checkpoint is synced, the
global checkpoint will have advanced to the no ops performed. There is a
larger conceptual problem here, namely that the primary does not update
its knowledge of its own local checkpoint upon recovery which causes the
global checkpoint to initially be unassigned and then advance to no ops
performed, but this will be addressed in a follow-up.
