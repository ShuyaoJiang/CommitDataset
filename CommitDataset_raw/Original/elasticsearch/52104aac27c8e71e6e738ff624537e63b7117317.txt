SQL: Introduce support for NULL values (#34573)

Make SQL aware of missing and/or unmapped fields treating them as NULL
Make _all_ functions and operators null-safe aware, including when used
in filtering or sorting contexts
Add missing and null-safe doc value extractor
Modify dataset to have null fields spread around (in groups of 10)
Enforce missing last and unmapped_type inside sorting
Consolidate Predicate templating and declaration
Add support for Like/RLike in scripting
Generalize NULLS LAST/FIRST
Introduce early schema declaration for CSV spec tests: to keep the doc
snippets in place (introduce schema:: prefix for declaration)
upfront.
