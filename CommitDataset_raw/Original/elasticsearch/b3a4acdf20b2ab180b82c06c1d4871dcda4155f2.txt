Limit user to single concurrent auth per realm (#30794)

This commit reworks the way our realms perform caching in order to
limit each principal to a single ongoing authentication per realm. In
other words, this means that multiple requests made by the same user
will not trigger more that one authentication attempt at a time if no
entry has been stored in the cache. If an entry is present in our
cache, there is no restriction on the number of concurrent
authentications performed for this user.

This change enables us to limit the load we place on an external system
like an LDAP server and also preserve resources such as CPU on
expensive operations such as BCrypt authentication.

Closes #30355
