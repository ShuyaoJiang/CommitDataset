Remove manual tracking of registered channels (#27445)

This is related to #27260. Currently, every ESSelector keeps track of
all channels that are registered with it. ESSelector is just an
abstraction over a raw java nio selector. The java nio selector already
tracks its own selection keys. This commit removes our tracking and
relies on the java nio selector tracking.
