Add global checkpoint tracking on the primary

This commit adds local tracking of the global checkpoints on all shard
copies when a global checkpoint tracker is operating in primary
mode. With this, we relay the global checkpoint on a shard copy back to
the primary shard during replication operations. This serves as another
step towards adding a background sync of the global checkpoint to the
shard copies.
