Enabling testing against an external cluster (#30885)

Today when executing REST tests we take full responsibility for cluster
configuration. Yet, there are use cases for brining your own cluster to
the REST tests. This commit is a small first step towards that effort by
skipping creating the cluster if the tests.rest.cluster and test.cluster
system properties are set. In this case, the user takes full
responsibility for configuring the cluster as expected by the REST
tests. This step is by no means meant to be perfect or complete, only a
baby step.
