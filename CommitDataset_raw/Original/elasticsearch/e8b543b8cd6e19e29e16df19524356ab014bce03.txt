Force stable file modes for built packages (#30823)

If you have an unusual umask (e.g., 0002) and clone the GitHub
repository then files that we stick into our packages like the
README.textile and the license will have a file mode of 0664 on disk yet
we expect them to be 0644. Additionally, the same thing happens with
compiled artifacts like JARs. We try to set a default file mode yet it
does not seem to take everywhere. This commit adds explicit file modes
in some places that we were relying on the defaults to ensure that the
built artifacts have a consistent file mode regardless of the underlying
build host.
