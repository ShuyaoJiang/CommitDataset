[Docs] Docs tests should wait for async execution to complete (#28481)

This commit splits the async execution documentation into 2 parts, one
for the async method itself and one for the action listener. This allows
to add more doc and to use CountDownLatches in doc tests to wait for
asynchronous operations to be completed before moving to the next test.

It also renames few files.
