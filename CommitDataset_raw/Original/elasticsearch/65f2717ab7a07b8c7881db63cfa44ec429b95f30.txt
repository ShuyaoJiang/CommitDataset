Make PreConfiguredTokenFilter harder to misuse (#24572)

There are now three public static method to build instances of
PreConfiguredTokenFilter and the ctor is private. I chose static
methods instead of constructors because those allow us to change
out the implementation returned if we so desire.

Relates to #23658
