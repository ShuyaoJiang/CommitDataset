TEST: Adjust translog size assumption in new engine

A new engine now can have more than one empty translog since #28676.
This cause #testShouldPeriodicallyFlush failed because in the test we
asssume an engine should have one empty translog. This commit takes into
account the extra translog size of a new engine.
