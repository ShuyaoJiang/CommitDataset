Inline TransportReplAction#registerRequestHandlers (#40762)

It is important that resync actions are not rejected on the primary even if its
`write` threadpool is overloaded. Today we do this by exposing
`registerRequestHandlers` to subclasses and overriding it in
`TransportResyncReplicationAction`. This isn't ideal because it obscures the
difference between this action and other replication actions, and also might
allow subclasses to try and use some state before they are properly
initialised. This change replaces this override with a constructor parameter to
solve these issues.
