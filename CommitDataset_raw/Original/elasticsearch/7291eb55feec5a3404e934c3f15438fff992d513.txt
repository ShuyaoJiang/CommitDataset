Automatically enable AES 256 bit TLS ciphers when available (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2137)

This commit adds detection of support for AES 256 bit ciphers and enables their use when the JVM
supports them. For OpenJDK, this is often the case without any changes but for the Oracle JVM, the
unlimited policy file needs to be installed. In order to simplify the work a user would need to do
we can detect this support and automatically enable the AES 256 bit versions of the ciphers we
already enable.
