Remove "reinstall" packaging tests (#37851)

The packaging tests currently have a test which installs elasticsearch,
removes it, modifies ownership of /etc/elasticsearch, and
reinstalls. It then checks that the /etc/elasticsearch directory has
ownership that the package expects. But the recursive change touches
files not owned by the package. In the past this worked because we did a
recursive ownership change within the package postinst. However, that
was recently removed, and thus this test no longer makes sense.
