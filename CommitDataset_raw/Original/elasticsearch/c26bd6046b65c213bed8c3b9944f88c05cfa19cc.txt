Fix (simple)_query_string to ignore removed terms (#28871)

This change ensures that we ignore terms removed from the analysis rather than returning a match_no_docs query for the part
that contain the stop word. For instance a query like "the AND fox" should ignore "the" if it is considered as a stop word instead of
adding a match_no_docs query.
This change also fixes the analysis of prefix terms that start with a stop word (e.g. `the*`). In such case if `analyze_wildcard` is true and `the`
is considered as a stop word this part of the query is rewritten into a match_no_docs query. Since it's a prefix query this change forces the prefix query
on `the` even if it is removed from the analysis.
