SQL: Introduce IsNull node to simplify expressions (#35206)

Add `IsNull` node in parser to simplify expressions so that `<value> IS NULL` is
no longer translated internally to `NOT(<value> IS NOT NULL)`

Replace `IsNotNullProcessor` with `CheckNullProcessor` to encapsulate both
isNull and isNotNull functionality.

Closes: #34876
Fixes: #35171
