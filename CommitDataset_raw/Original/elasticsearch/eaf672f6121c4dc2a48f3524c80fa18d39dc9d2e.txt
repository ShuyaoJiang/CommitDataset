[ML] Don't install empty ML metadata on startup (#30751)

This change is to support rolling upgrade from a pre-6.3 default
distribution (i.e. without X-Pack) to a 6.3+ default distribution
(i.e. with X-Pack).

The ML metadata is no longer eagerly added to the cluster state
as soon as the master node has X-Pack available.  Instead, it
is added when the first ML job is created.

As a result all methods that get the ML metadata need to be able
to handle the situation where there is no ML metadata in the
current cluster state.  They do this by behaving as though an
empty ML metadata was present.  This logic is encapsulated by
always asking for the current ML metadata using a static method
on the MlMetadata class.
