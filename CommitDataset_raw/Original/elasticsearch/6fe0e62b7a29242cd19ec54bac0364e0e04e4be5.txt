[CCR] Added write buffer size limit (#34797)

This limit is based on the size in bytes of the operations in the write buffer. If this limit is exceeded then no more read operations will be coordinated until the size in bytes of the write buffer has dropped below the configured write buffer size limit.

Renamed existing `max_write_buffer_size` to ``max_write_buffer_count` to indicate that limit is count based.

Closes #34705
