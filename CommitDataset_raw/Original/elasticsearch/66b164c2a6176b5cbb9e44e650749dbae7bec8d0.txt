[CCR] Removed custom follow and unfollow api's reponse classes with AcknowledgedResponse (#33260)

These response classes did not add any value and in that case just AcknowledgedResponse should be used.

I also changed the formatting of methods to take one line per parameter in
FollowIndexAction.java and UnfollowIndexAction.java files to make
reviewing diffs in the future easier.
