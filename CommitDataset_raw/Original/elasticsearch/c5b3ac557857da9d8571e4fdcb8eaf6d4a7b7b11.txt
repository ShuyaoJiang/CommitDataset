SNAPSHOTS: Allow Parallel Restore Operations (#36397)

* Enable parallel restore operations
* Add uuid to restore in progress entries to uniquely identify them
* Adjust restore in progress entries to be a map in cluster state
* Added tests for:
   * Parallel restore from two different snapshots
   * Parallel restore from a single snapshot to different indices to test uuid identifiers are correctly used by `RestoreService` and routing allocator
   * Parallel restore with waiting for completion to test transport actions correctly use uuid identifiers
