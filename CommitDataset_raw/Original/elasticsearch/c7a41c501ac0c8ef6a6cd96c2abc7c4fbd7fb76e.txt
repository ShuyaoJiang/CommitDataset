Painless: Simplify Naming in Lookup Package (#32177)

This removes some extraneous naming syntax and makes clear the meaning of certain
naming conventions without ambiguities (stricter) within the lookup package. Purely 
mechanical change. Note this does not cover a large portion of the 
PainlessLookupBuilder and PainlessLookup yet as there are several more follow up PRs for these incoming.
