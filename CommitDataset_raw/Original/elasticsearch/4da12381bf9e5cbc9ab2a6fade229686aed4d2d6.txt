Remove RowSetCursor (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2624)

`RowSetCursor` was just like `RowSet` only it had methods that allowed
you to scroll to the next page. We now use `RowSet#nextPageCursor` to
get the next page in a way that doesn't require us to store state on
the server. So we can remove `RowSetCursor` entirely now.
