Allow single digit milliseconds in strict date parsing (#40676)

In order to remain compatible with the existing joda based
implementation the parsing of milliseconds should support parsing single
digits instead of relying on three, even with strict formats.

This adds a few tests to duel against the existing joda based
implementation in order to ensure the parsing behaviour is the same.

Closes #40403
