Never block on key in `LiveVersionMap#pruneTombstones` (#28736)

Pruning tombstones is best effort and should not block if a key is currently
locked. This can cause a deadlock in rare situations if we switch of append
only optimization while heavily updating the same key in the engine
while the LiveVersionMap is locked. This is very rare since this code
patch only executed every 15 seconds by default since that is the interval
we try to prune the deletes in the version map.

Closes #28714
