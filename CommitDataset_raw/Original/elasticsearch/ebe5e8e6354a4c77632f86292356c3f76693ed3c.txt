REST high-level client: encode path parts (#28663)

The REST high-level client supports now encoding of path parts, so that for instance documents with valid ids, but containing characters that need to be encoded as part of urls (`#` etc.), are properly supported. We also make sure that each path part can contain `/` by encoding them properly too.

Closes #28625
