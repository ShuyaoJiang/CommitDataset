Relax TranslogWriter#assertNoSeqNumberConflict (#31569)

If the recovery and indexing are concurrently happening, it's possible
for a replica to receive the same operation twice: one from the
replication, and the other from the recovery. However, these operations
are not identical because we don't store the versionType of operations
in the Lucene index.

The TranslogWriter#assertNoSeqNumberConflict assertion has been tripped
several times in the CCR branch since we use Lucene in peer-recovery.
This commit relaxes that assertion by excluding the versionType from the
check.
