Do not update number of replicas on no indices (#34481)

Today when submitting an update settings request to update the number of
replicas with a wildcard that does not match any indices and allow no
indices is set to true, the request ends up being interpreted as
updating the number of replicas for all indices. That is, consider the
following sequence:

PUT /test-index
{
  "settings": {
    "index.number_of_replicas": 0
  }
}

PUT /non-existent-*/_settings?expand_wildcards=open&allow_no_indices=true
{
  "settings": {
    "index.number_of_replicas": 1
  }
}

GET /test-index/_settings

The latter will show that the number of replicas on test-index is now
one. This is surprising, and should be considered a bug.

The underlying problem here is treating no indices in the underlying
methods used to update the routing table and the metadata as meaning all
indices. This commit takes away this assumption. Tests that relied on
this behavior have been changed to no longer rely on this.

A test for this situation is added in UpdateNumberOfReplicasIT.
