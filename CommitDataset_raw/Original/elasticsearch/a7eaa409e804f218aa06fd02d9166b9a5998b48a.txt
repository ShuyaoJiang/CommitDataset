Fix TransportChangePasswordActionTests

testIncorrectPasswordHashingAlgorithm is based on the assumption
that the algorithm selected for the change password request is
different than the one selected for the NativeUsersStore.
pbkdf2_10000 is the same as pbkdf2 since 10000 is the default cost
factor for pbkdf2 and thus should not be used as an option for the
passwordHashingSettings.

Also make sure that the same algorithm is used for settings and
change password requests in other tests for consistency, even if
we expect to not reach the code where the algorithm is checked for
now.
