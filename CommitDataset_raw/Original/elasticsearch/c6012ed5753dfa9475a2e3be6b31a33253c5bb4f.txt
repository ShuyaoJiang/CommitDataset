fix writeIndex evaluation for aliases (#31562)

AliasOrIndex.Alias#writeIndex was returning a write index when
an alias was pointing to only one index, regardless whether `is_write_index` was
set to `false`. This fixes that so that there is no write index in such a case
that an alias points to only one index with `is_write_index=false`.
