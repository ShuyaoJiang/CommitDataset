Track EWMA[1] of task execution time in search threadpool executor

This is the first step towards adaptive replica selection (#24915). This PR
tracks the execution time, also known as the "service time" of a task in the
threadpool. The `QueueResizingEsThreadPoolExecutor` then stores a moving average
of these task times which can be retrieved from the executor.

Currently there is no functionality using the EWMA yet (other than tests), this
is only a bite-sized building block so that it's easier to review.
