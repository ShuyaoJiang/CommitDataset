Enable logs for intermittent test failure (#38426)

I have not been able to reproduce the failing
test scenario locally for #38408 and there are other similar
tests which are running fine in the same test class.
I am re-enabling the test with additional logs so
that we can debug further on what's happening.
I will keep the issue open for now and look out for the builds
to see if there are any related failures.
