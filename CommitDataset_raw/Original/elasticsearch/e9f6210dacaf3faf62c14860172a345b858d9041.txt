Add cluster name validation to RemoteClusterConnection (#25568)

This change adds validation to the RemoteClusterConnection to ensure
we always use seed nodes from the same cluster. While we still allow to use
an arbitrary cluster alias we ensure that we, once we connected to a cluster the first time,
we always check against that initial cluster name when we execute a seed node handshake.
