Enable reading auto-follow patterns from x-content (#40130)

This named writable was never registered, so it means that we could not
read auto-follow patterns that were registered in the cluster
state. This causes them to be lost on restarts, a bad bug. This commit
addresses this by registering this named writable, and we add a basic
CCR restart test to ensure that CCR keeps functioning properly when the
follower is restarted.
