[Kerberos] Find if port is available before using it for Kdc server (#36192)

If the randomly selected port was already in use the Kerberos
tests would fail. This commit adds check to see if the network
port is available and if not continue to find one for KDC server.
If it does not find port after 100 retries it throws an exception.

Closes #34261
