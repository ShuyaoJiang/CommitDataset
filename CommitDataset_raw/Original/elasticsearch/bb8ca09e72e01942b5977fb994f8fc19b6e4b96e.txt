Log close_notify during handshake at debug level (#39715)

A TLS handshake requires exchanging multiple messages to initiate a
session. If one side decides to close during the handshake, it is
supposed to send a close_notify alert (similar to closing during
application data exchange). The java SSLEngine engine throws an
exception when this happens. We currently log this at the warn level if
trace logging is not enabled. This level is too high for a valid
scenario. Additionally it happens all the time in tests (quickly closing
and opened transports). This commit changes this to be logged at the
debug level if trace is not enabled. Additionally, it extracts the
transport security exception handling to a common class.
