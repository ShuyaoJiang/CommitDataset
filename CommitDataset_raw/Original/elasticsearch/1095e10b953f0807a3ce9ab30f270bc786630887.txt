Fix Watcher stats class cast exception (#39821)

The watcher stats implementation tries to look at all queued watches
before preparing the result. We want to cast these to a
WatchExecutionTask to extract the context to prepare the stats for
queued watches. The problem is that not all tasks on the watcher queue
were WatchExecutionTask. This is because a manually executed watch was
not even at all wrapped in a WatchExecutionTask. Moreover, we were using
ExecutorService#submit(Runnable) which would wrap the Runnable in a
FutureTask<?>. This commit addresses this by using a WatchExecutionTask,
and also using ExecutorService#execute(Runnable) so that no wrapping
occurs. This will let us continue with the assumption that all queued
tasks are WatchExecutionTasks.
