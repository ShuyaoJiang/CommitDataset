Remove bwc logic for token invalidation (#36893)

- Removes bwc invalidation logic from the TokenService
- Removes bwc serialization for InvalidateTokenResponse objects as
    old nodes in supported mixed clusters during upgrade will be 6.7 and
    thus will know of the new format
- Removes the created field from the TokensInvalidationResult and the
    InvalidateTokenResponse as it is no longer useful in > 7.0
