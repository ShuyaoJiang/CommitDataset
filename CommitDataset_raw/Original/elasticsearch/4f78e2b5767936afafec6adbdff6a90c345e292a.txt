SQL: Improve painless script generated from `IN` (#35055)

Replace standard `||` and `==` painless operators with
new `in` method introduced in `InternalSqlScriptUtils`.
This allows the list of values to become a script variable
which is replaced each time with the list of  values provided
by the user.

Move In to the same package as InPipe & InProcessor

Follow up to #34750
