SQL: Fix type and value in SYS TYPES (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3979)

The type of BUFFER_LENGTH needs to be an integer (not NULL) and unsigned
indicate the opposite of signed.
Change isSigned from Object to primitive
Since all the consumer of isSigned expect a primitive, an Object is just causing troubles by being null.
Update description table
