Allow indices.get_mapping response parsing without types (#37492)

This change adds deprecation warning to the indices.get_mapping API in case the
"inlcude_type_name" parameter is set to "true" and changes the parsing code in
GetMappingsResponse to parse the type-less response instead of the one
containing types. As a consequence the HLRC client doesn't need to force
"include_type_name=true" any more and the GetMappingsResponseTests can be
adapted to the new format as well. Also removing some "include_type_name"
parameters in yaml test and docs where not necessary.
