Expand migration note regarding default paths

This commit expands on the migration note regarding the removal of
default.path.data and default.path.logs to include a note that users
that were relying on the defaults (the common case for path.logs), and
they carry over their previous elasticsearch.yml configruation file,
then they must add explicit values for path.data and path.logs.
