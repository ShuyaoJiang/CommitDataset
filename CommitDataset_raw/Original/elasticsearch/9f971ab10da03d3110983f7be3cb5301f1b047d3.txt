Add log message for auto-follower timeout

When an auto-follower coordinator times out waiting for the remote
cluster state, we do not log any indication of this. While this is
expected behavior in quiet deployments, it is still useful to see this
information for tracing the behavior of the auto-follow
coordinator. This commit adds a trace log message indicating that the
timeout.
