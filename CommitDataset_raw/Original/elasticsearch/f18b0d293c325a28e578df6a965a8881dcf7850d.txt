Move TransportStats accounting into TcpTransport (#25251)

Today TcpTransport is the de-facto base-class for transport implementations.
The need for all the callbacks we have in TransportServiceAdaptor are not necessary
anymore since we can simply have the logic inside the base class itself. This change
moves the stats metrics directly into TcpTransport removing the need for low level
bytes send / received callbacks.
