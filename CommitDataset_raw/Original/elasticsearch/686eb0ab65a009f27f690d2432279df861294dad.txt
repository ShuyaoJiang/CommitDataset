[ML] Refactor [Bucket|Record]QueryBuilder classes (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2684)

Those classes used to be elasticsearch-agnostic wrappers
of the query parameters. However, we now do not need that
layer of abstraction. Instead we can make those builders
own the building of the SearchSourceBuilder, which
simplifies the JobProvider and makes them reusable.
