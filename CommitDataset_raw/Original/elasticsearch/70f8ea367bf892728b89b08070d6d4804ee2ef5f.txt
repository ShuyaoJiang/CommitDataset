Allow index settings to be reset by wildcards (#27671)

Index settings didn't support reset by wildcard which also causes
issues like #27537 where archived settings can't be reset. This change
adds support for wildcards like `archived.*` to be used to reset setting to their
defaults or remove them from an index.

Closes #27537
