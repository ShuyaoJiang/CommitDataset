Add scrolling support to jdbc (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2524)

* Switch `ResultSet#getFetchSize` from returning the *requested*
fetch size to returning the size of the current page of results.
For scrolling searches without parent/child this'll match the
requested fetch size but for other things it won't. The nice thing
about this is that it lets us tell users a thing to look at if
they are wondering why they are using a bunch of memory.
* Remove all the entire JDBC action and implement it on the REST
layer instead.
* Create some code that can be shared between the cli and jdbc
actions to properly handle errors and request deserialization so
there isn't as much copy and paste between the two. This helps
because it calls out explicitly the places where they are different.
  * I have not moved the CLI REST handle to shared code because
I think it'd be clearer to make that change in a followup PR.
* There is now no more need for constructs that allow iterating
all of the results in the same request. I have not removed these
because I feel that that cleanup is big enough to deserve its own
PR.
