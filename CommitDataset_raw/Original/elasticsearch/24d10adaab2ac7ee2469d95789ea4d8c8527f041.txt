Main response should not have status 503 when okay (#29045)

The REST status 503 means "I can not handle the request that you sent
me." However today we respond to a main request with a 503 when there
are certain cluster blocks despite still responding with an actual main
response. This is broken, we should respond with a 200 status. This
commit removes this silliness.
