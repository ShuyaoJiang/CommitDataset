[ML] Add a file structure determination endpoint (#33471)

This endpoint accepts an arbitrary file in the request body and
attempts to determine the structure.  If successful it also
proposes mappings that could be used when indexing the file's
contents, and calculates simple statistics for each of the fields
that are useful in the data preparation step prior to configuring
machine learning jobs.
