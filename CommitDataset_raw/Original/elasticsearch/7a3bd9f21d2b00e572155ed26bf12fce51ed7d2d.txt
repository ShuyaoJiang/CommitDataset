Look up connection using the right cluster alias when releasing contexts (#38570)

Whenever phase failure is raised in AbstractSearchAsyncAction, we go and
release search contexts of shards that successfully returned their
results, prior to notifying the listener of the failure. In case we are
executing a CCS request, it's important to look-up the connection to
send the release context request to.

This commit makes sure that the lookup takes the cluster alias into
account. We used to use `null` at all times instead which is not correct
and was not caught as any exception is caught without re-throwing it.
