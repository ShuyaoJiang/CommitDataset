Tests: Add parsing test for AggregationsTests (#25396)

We already have these tests in InternalAggregationTestCase to check random insertions into the response xContent so that we don't fail on future changes in the response format. This change adds the same to AggregationsTests and runs on a whole aggregations tree. Unfortunately we need to exclude many places in the xContent from random insertion, but I added a long comment trying to explaine those.
