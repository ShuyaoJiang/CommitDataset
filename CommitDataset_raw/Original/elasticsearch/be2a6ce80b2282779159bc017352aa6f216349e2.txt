Notify onConnectionClosed rather than onNodeDisconnect to prune transport handlers (#24639)

Today we prune transport handlers in TransportService when a node is disconnected.
This can cause connections to starve in the TransportService if the connection is
opened as a short living connection ie. without sharing the connection to a node
via registering in the transport itself. This change now moves to pruning based
on the connections cache key to ensure we notify handlers as soon as the connection
is closed for all connections not just for registered connections.
