[Tests] Relax allowed delta in extended_stats aggregation (#30569)

The order in which double values are added in java can give different results
for the sum, so we need to allow a certain delta in the test assertions. The
current value was still a bit too low, resulting in rare test failures. This
change increases the allowed margin of error by a factor of ten.
