SQL: Fix running `gradle run` from top-level directory (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3329)

When running `gradle run` at the top level (at least with Gradle 4.4) it
attempts to run multiple instances of the server, causing the run to fail since
they can't both bind to 9200/9300.

This renames the tasks for the `qa` directories to be `runqa` and the task for
the `cli` directory to be `runcli`.
