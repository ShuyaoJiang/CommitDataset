Set minimum_master_nodes on rolling-upgrade test (#26911)

The rolling-upgrade test was only writing the "minimum_master_nodes" setting to the configuration file of the old nodes, but not the upgraded ones.

Also changes the value of "minimum_master_nodes" from "number_of_nodes" to "(number_of_nodes / 2) + 1".
