Support distance units in GeoHashGrid aggregation precision (#26291)

Currently the `precision` parameter must be a precision level
in the range of [1,12]. In #5042 it was suggested also supporting
distance units like "1km" to automatically approcimate the needed
precision level. This change adds this support to the Rest API by
making use of GeoUtils#geoHashLevelsForPrecision.

Plain integer values without a unit are still treated as precision
levels like before. Distance values that are too small to be represented
by a precision level of 12 (values approx. less than 0.056m) are
rejected.

Closes #5042
