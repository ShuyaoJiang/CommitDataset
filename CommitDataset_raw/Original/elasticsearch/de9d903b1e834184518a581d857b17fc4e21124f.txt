Plugins: Fix meta plugins to install bundled plugins with their real name (#28285)

Meta plugins move the unzipped plugin as is, but the inner plugins may
have a different directory name than their corresponding plugin
properties file specifies. This commit fixes installation to rename the
directory if necessary.
