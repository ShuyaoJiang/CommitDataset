Set mappings when creating indices in SuggestSearchIT (#39323)

* Set mappings when creating indices in SuggestSearchIT

These tests don't test dynamic mapping, so they can use preset mappings. This
removes the possibility they may fail due to the mapping not being available
since mapping updates are asynchronous.

Resolves #39315

* Wrap creates in assertAcked
