Cache the score of the parent document in the nested agg (#36019)

The nested agg can defer the collection of children if it is nested
under another aggregation. In such case accessing the score in the children
aggregation throws an error because the scorer has already advanced to the next
parent. This change fixes this error by caching the score of the parent in the
nested aggregation. Children aggregations that work on nested documents will be
able to access the _score. Also note that the _score in this case is always the
parent's score, there is no way to retrieve the score of a nested docs in aggregations.
