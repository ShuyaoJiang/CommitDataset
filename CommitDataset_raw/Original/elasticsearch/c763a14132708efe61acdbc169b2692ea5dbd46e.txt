Pass InputStream when creating XContent parser (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4001)

* Pass InputStream when creating XContent parser

Rather than passing the raw `BytesReference` in when creating the xcontent
parser, this passes the StreamInput (which is an InputStream), this allows us to
decouple XContent from BytesReference.

This is the x-pack side of https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/28754

* Use the streamInput variant, not sourceAsString
