Make keepalive pings bidirectional and optimizable (#35441)

This is related to #34405 and a follow-up to #34753. It makes a number
of changes to our current keepalive pings.

The ping interval configuration is moved to the ConnectionProfile.

The server channel now responds to pings. This makes the keepalive
pings bidirectional.

On the client-side, the pings can now be optimized away. What this
means is that if the channel has received a message or sent a message
since the last pinging round, the ping is not sent for this round.
