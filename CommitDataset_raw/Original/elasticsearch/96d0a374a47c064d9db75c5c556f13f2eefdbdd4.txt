Test: fix check for security version after template updater change

This change fixes the check for the version of the security template after the template updater was
changed to only run on the master node in elastic/elasticsearch#27294. Additionally, the wait time
for the cluster to have a yellow status has been increased to account for delayed shards and slower
machines.
