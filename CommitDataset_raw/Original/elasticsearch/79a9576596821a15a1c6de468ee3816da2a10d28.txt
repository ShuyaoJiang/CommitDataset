Test: do not wipe templates from clusters in audit tests

This commit adds both the security index template and the audit index template to the excluded
templates for the RemoteIndexAuditTrailStartingTests and IndexAuditTrailTests. By allowing the
templates to remain in place, we make it easier for subsequent tests in the suite to have their
audit trails started.
