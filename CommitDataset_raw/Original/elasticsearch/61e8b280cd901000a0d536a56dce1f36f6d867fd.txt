Remove timeout task after completing cluster state publication (#40411)

Each cluster state publication schedules a cancellation task with the provided publication timeout
(30s by default). This scheduled cancellation keeps a reference to the publication, and therefore the
full cluster state that was published. In case of frequently updating a large cluster state, this results
in a large number of cancellation tasks keeping references to all previously published cluster states.
