Remove support for maxRetryTimeout from low-level REST client (#38085)

We have had various reports of problems caused by the maxRetryTimeout
setting in the low-level REST client. Such setting was initially added
in the attempts to not have requests go through retries if the request
already took longer than the provided timeout.

The implementation was problematic though as such timeout would also
expire in the first request attempt (see #31834), would leave the
request executing after expiration causing memory leaks (see #33342),
and would not take into account the http client internal queuing (see #25951).

Given all these issues, it seems that this custom timeout mechanism 
gives little benefits while causing a lot of harm. We should rather rely 
on connect and socket timeout exposed by the underlying http client 
and accept that a request can overall take longer than the configured 
timeout, which is the case even with a single retry anyways.

This commit removes the `maxRetryTimeout` setting and all of its usages.
