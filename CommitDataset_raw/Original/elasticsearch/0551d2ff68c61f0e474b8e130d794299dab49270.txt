Move generic http settings out of netty module (#26310)

There is a group of five settings relating to raw tcp configurations
(no_delay, buffer sizes, etc) that we have for the http transport. These
currently live in the netty module. As they are unrelated to netty
specifically, this commit moves these settings to the
`HttpTransportSettings` class in core.
