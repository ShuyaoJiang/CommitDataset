Use stronger write-once semantics for Azure repository (#30437)

There's no need for an extra blobExists() call when writing a blob to the Azure service. Azure
provides an option (with stronger consistency guarantees) on the upload method that guarantees
that the blob that's uploaded does not already exist. This saves one network roundtrip.
