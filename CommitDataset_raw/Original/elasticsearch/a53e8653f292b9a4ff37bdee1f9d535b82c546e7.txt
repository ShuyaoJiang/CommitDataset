Add support for inlined user dictionary in Nori (#36123)

Add support for inlined user dictionary in Nori

This change adds a new option called `user_dictionary_rules` to the
Nori a tokenizer`. It can be used to set additional tokenization rules
to the Korean tokenizer directly in the settings (instead of using a file).
