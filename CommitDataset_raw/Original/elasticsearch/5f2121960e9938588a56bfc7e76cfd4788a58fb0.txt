Synced-flush should not seal index of out of sync replicas (#28464)

Today the correctness of synced-flush is guaranteed by ensuring that 
there is no ongoing indexing operations on the primary. Unfortunately, a
replica might fall out of sync with the primary even the condition is
met. Moreover, if synced-flush mistakenly issues a sync_id for an out of
sync replica, then that replica would not be able to recover from the 
primary. ES prevents that peer-recovery because it detects that both
indexes from primary and replica were sealed with the same sync_id but
have a different content. This commit modifies the synced-flush to not
issue sync_id for out of sync replicas. This change will report the
divergence issue earlier to users and also prevent replicas from getting
into the "unrecoverable" state.
