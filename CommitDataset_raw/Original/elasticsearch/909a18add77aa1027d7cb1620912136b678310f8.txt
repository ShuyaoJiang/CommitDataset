Only set vm.max_map_count if greater than default (#31512)

So the issue here is that we want to avoid setting vm.max_map_count if
it is already equal to the desired value (the bootstrap check requires
262144). The reason we want to avoid this is because in some use-cases
using sysctl to set this will fail. In this case, we want to enable
users to set this value externally and then allow that to cause using
sysctl to set the value to be skipped so that cases where using sysctl
will fail to no longer fail.
