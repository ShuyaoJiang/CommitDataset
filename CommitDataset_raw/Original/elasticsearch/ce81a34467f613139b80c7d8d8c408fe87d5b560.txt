SQL: Add jdbc mode to REST API (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3499)

Adds a mode parameter to all SQL-related requests. The mode parameter is used for license checks as well as to define the response content. For now only two modes are supported plain (default) and jdbc. We will add other modes in the future as we add more clients.
