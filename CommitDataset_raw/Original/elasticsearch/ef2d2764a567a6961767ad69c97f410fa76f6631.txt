Watcher: Improve cluster state listener behaviour (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3538)

The cluster state listener used by watch now have two additional checks.
First, when no master node exists in the cluster state, watcher will
stop and the indexing listener will not try to trigger any new watch.
Second, when there is a global cluster write level block, it would not
be possible to update the watches index or write into the watcher
history, so the listener can bail at that case as well.

In addition this also changes the log level from debug to info when
watcher is stopped. It turned out that there are zero insights when or
if watcher is stopped when normal logging is activated. This makes it
super hard for support to know when watcher is stopped or started at all
due to shards being moved around.
