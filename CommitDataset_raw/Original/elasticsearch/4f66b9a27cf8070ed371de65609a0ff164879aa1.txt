Transport client: Don't validate node in handshake (#30737)

This is related to #30141. Right now in the transport client we open a
temporary node connection and take the node information. This node
information is used to open a permanent connection that is used for the
client. However, we continue to use the configured transport address.
If the configured transport address is a load balancer, you might
connect to a different node for the permanent connection. This causes
the handshake validation to fail. This commit removes the handshake
validation for the transport client when it simple node sample mode.
