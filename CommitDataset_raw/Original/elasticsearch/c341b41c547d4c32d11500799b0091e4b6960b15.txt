[TEST] Temporarily silence MovAvgIT tests due to change in double comparisons

#29409 removed the nearlyEquals() double comparison snippet, which
makes these tests very flaky because they can generate very large or
very small doubles which don't work well with absolute error comparison.

We need to either refactor these tests to guarantee they stay in a small
range (which could be difficult due to holt/holt-winters) or re-implement
the more robust double comparison.

Tracking issue: #29456
