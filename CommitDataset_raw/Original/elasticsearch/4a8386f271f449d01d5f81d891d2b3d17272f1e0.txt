SQL: Implement IN(value1, value2, ...) expression. (#34581)

Implement the functionality to translate the
`field IN (value1, value2,...)` expressions to proper Lucene queries
or painless script or local processors depending on the use case.

The `IN` expression can be used in SELECT, WHERE and HAVING clauses.

Closes: #32955
