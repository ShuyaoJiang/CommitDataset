Index phrases (#30450)

Specifying `index_phrases: true` on a text field mapping will add a subsidiary
[field]._index_phrase field, indexing two-term shingles from the parent field.
The parent analysis chain is re-used, wrapped with a FixedShingleFilter.

At query time, if a phrase match query is executed, the mapping will redirect it
to run against the subsidiary field.

This should trade faster phrase querying for a larger index and longer indexing
times.
