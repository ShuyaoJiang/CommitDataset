Fix InternalEngineTests#assertOpsOnPrimary (#37746)

The assertion `assertOpsOnPrimary` does not store seq_no and primary
term of successful deletes to the `lastOpSeqNo` and `lastOpTerm`. This
leads to failures of the subsequence CAS deletes or indexes with seq_no
and term. Moreover, this assertion trips a translog assertion because it
bumps the primary term of some operations but not the primary term of
the engine.
