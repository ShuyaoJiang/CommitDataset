Security: upgrade unboundid ldapsdk to 4.0.8 (#34247)

This commit upgrades the unboundid ldapsdk to version 4.0.8. The
primary driver for upgrading is a fix that prevents this library from
rewrapping Error instances that would normally bubble up to the
UncaughtExceptionHandler and terminate the JVM. Other notable changes
include some fixes related to connection handling in the library's
connection pool implementation.

Closes #33175
