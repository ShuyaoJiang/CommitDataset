[ML] Avoid creating spurious 0 "actual" values for model plot documents (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2535)

Some model plot documents should not have an "actual" value, for example
when no input events were seen for a meean/min/max detector in a particular
bucket.  Prior to this change we would set the "actual" value to 0 for such
model plot documents.  Following this change no "actual" value will be
present in these documents.

Only newly created model plot documents are affected.  Model plot documents
that were incorrectly written in the past will remain wrong forever.
