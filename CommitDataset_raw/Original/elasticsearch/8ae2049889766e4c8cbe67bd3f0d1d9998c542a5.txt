Avoid deprecation warning when running the ML datafeed extractor. (#31463)

In #29639 we added a `format` option to doc-value fields and deprecated usage
of doc-value fields without a format so that we could migrate doc-value fields
to use the format that comes with the mappings by default. However I missed to
fix the machine-learning datafeed extractor.
