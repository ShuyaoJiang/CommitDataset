Cleanup exception handling in IOUtils (#29069)

When we copied IOUtils into the Elasticsearch codebase from Lucene, we
brought with it its handling of throwables which are out of whack with
how we handle throwables in our codebase. This commit modifies our copy
of IOUtils to be consistent with how we handle throwables today: do not
catch them. We take advantage of this cleanup to simplify IOUtils.
