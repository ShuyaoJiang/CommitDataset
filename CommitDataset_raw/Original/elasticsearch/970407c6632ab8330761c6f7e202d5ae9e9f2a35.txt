[DOCS] add comment to clarify cluster name resolution (#34014)

We currently fallback to local indices whenever a remote cluster is not found, as there may still be indices / aliases with the same name. Such behaviour is lenient but needs to be kept for backwards compatibility. Clarified that in the code so we don't forget.
