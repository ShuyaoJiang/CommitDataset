Simplify connection closing and cleanups in TcpTransport (#25250)

Today we maintain a map of open connections in order to close them when
a low level channel gets closed or handles a failure. We also spawn a thread due to some
tricky concurrency issues especially with respect to netty since they listener might
be called on a transport / boss thread. Executions on those threads must not be blocking
since otherwise we will likely deadlock the event processing which adds to the
complexity of the concurrency model in this class.

This change associates the connection with the close callback that every channel invokes
once it's closed which allows us to remove the connections map. A relaxed non-blocking
concurrency model in the connection close listener allows cleaning up connected nodes without
blocking on any lock.
