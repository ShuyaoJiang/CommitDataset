Fix handling of dirty PID file

When Elasticsearch dies during a standalone REST test we might leave a
dirty PID file laying around. We tried to log about this, but the log
messages contained references to undefined variables so we simply died
instead of providing a helpful message to run clean. This commit
addresses this issue.
