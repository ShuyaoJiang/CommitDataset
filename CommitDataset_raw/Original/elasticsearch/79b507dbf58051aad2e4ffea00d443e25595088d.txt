ingest: Introduce the dissect processor (#32884)

* ingest: Introduce the dissect processor

The ingest node dissect processor is an alternative to Grok
to split a string based on a pattern. Dissect differs from
Grok such that regular expressions are not used to split the
string.

Dissect can be used to parse a source text field with a
simpler pattern, and is often faster the Grok for basic string
parsing. This processor uses the dissect library which
does most of the work.
