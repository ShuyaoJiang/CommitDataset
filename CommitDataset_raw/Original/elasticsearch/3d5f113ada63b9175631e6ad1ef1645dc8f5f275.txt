Ensure we don't use a remote profile if cluster name matches (#31331)

If we are running into a race condition between a node being configured
to be a remote node for cross cluster search etc. and that node joining
the cluster we might connect to that node with a remote profile. If that
node now joins the cluster it connected to it as a CCS remote node we use
the wrong profile and can't use bulk connections etc. anymore. This change
uses the remote profile only if we connect to a node that has a different cluster
name than the local cluster. This is not a perfect fix for this situation but
is the safe option while potentially only loose a small optimization of using
less connections per node which is small anyways since we only connect to a
small set of nodes.
