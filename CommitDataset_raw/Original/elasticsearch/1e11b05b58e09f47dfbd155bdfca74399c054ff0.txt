Remove unused User class from protocol (#33137)

This commit removes the unused User class from the protocol project.
This class was originally moved into protocol in preparation for moving
more request and response classes, but given the change in direction
for the HLRC this is no longer needed. Additionally, this change also
changes the package name for the User object in x-pack/plugin/core to
its original name.
