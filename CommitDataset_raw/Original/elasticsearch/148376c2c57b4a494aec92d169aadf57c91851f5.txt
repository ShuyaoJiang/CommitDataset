Add limits for ngram and shingle settings (#27211)

* Add limits for ngram and shingle settings (#27211)

Create index-level settings:
max_ngram_diff - maximum allowed difference between max_gram and min_gram in
NGramTokenFilter/NGramTokenizer. Default is 1.
max_shingle_diff - maximum allowed difference between max_shingle_size and
 min_shingle_size in ShingleTokenFilter.  Default is 3.

Throw an IllegalArgumentException when
trying to create NGramTokenFilter, NGramTokenizer, ShingleTokenFilter
where difference between max_size and min_size exceeds the settings value.

Closes #25887
