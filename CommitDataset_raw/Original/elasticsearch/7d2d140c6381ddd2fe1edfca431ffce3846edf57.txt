Get node ID from nodes info in REST tests (#40052)

* Get master identity from nodes info in REST tests

We discussed recently that the cluster state API should be considered
"internal" and therefore our usual cast-iron stability guarantees do not hold
for this API.

However, there are a good number of REST tests that need to identify the master
node. Today they call `GET /_cluster/state` API and extract the master node ID
from the response. An alternative that avoids the unstable cluster state API is
to call `GET _nodes/_master`: the master node ID is the unique key in the
`nodes` map in the response.

This change adds the ability for YAML-based REST tests to extract the unique
key of a singleton map so that they can obtain the master node ID from the
nodes info API instead of the cluster state API.

* Allow access to an arbitrary node ID and adjust all YAML tests to use this

* Warnings
