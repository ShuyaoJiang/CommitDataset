[Zen2] Introduce VotingTombstone class (#35832)

Today voting tombstones are stored in CoordinationMetaData as
Set<DiscoveryNode>.
DiscoveryNode is not a lightweight object and have a lot of fields.
It also has toXContent method, but no fromXContent method and the
output of toXContent is not enough to re-create DiscoveryNode
object.
And votingTombstone set should be persisted as a part of MetaData.
On the other hand, the only thing required from the tombstone is the
nodeId.
This PR adds VotingTombstone class for voting tombstones, which
consists of two fields for now - nodeId and nodeName. It could be
extended/shrank in the future if needed.
This PR also resolves TODO's related to the voting tombstones xcontent
story.
Example of CoordinationMetaData.toXContent with voting tombstones:
