[Monitoring] Stop checking for old alerts in upgraded version (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1992)

This stops checking for older alerts now that we support emailing based on state changes. This only applies to 6.0 because the upgrade _can_ still happen usefully in 5.6 without the noise.

Original commit: elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch@9d73c64daad472f5cfd660b7dfb3503b8cc66728
