Fix IndexSearcherWrapper visibility (#39071)

* Fix IndexSearcherWrapper visibility

This change adds a wrapper for IndexSearcher that makes IndexSearcher#search(List, Weight, Collector) visible by
sub-classes. The wrapper is used by the ContextIndexSearcher to call this protected method on a searcher created by a plugin.
This ensures that an override of the protected method in an IndexSearcherWrapper plugin is called when a search is executed.
