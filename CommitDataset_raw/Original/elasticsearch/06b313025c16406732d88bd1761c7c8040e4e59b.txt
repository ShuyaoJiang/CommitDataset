Add elasticsearch-nio jar for base nio classes (#27801)

This is related to #27802. This commit adds a jar called
elasticsearch-nio that contains the base nio classes that will be used
for the tcp nio transport and eventually the http nio transport.

The jar does not depend on elasticsearch:core, so all references to core
have been removed.
