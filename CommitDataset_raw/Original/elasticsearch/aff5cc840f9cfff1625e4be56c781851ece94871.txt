Make generated passwords shell safe (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3253)

Generate passwords from  [A-Za-z0-9] so that they are safe to be
used in shell scripts.
Entropy deterioration is not significant (124.9 -> 119), generated
passwords still meet guidelines and best practices regarding length
and complexity.
