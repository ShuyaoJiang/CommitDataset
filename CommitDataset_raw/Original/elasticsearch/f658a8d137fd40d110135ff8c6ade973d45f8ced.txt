DateHistogram: Fix 'extended_bounds' with 'offset' (#23789)

This fixes a bug in the 'date_histogram' aggregation that can happen when using 'extended_bounds'
together with some 'offset' parameter. Offsets should be applied after rounding the extended bounds 
and also be applied when adding empty buckets during the reduce phase in InternalDateHistogram.

Closes #23776
