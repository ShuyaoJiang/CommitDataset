[TEST] Make SSL restrictions update atomic (#31050)

SSLTrustRestrictionsTests updates the restrictions YML file during the test run to change the set of restrictions. This update was small, but it wasn't atomic.
If the yml file is reloaded while empty or invalid, then it causes all SSL certificates to be considered invalid (until it is reloaded again), which could break the sniffing/administrative client that runs underneath the tests.
