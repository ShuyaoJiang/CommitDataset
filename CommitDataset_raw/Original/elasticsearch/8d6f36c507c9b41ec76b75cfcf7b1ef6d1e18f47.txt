Remove copy-pasted code (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4298)

* Remove copy-pasted code

An examination of the x-pack source code revealed copy-pasted code
in ActiveDirectoryGroupsResolver in the binarySidToStringSid
method.  I have replaced this with an apache2 implementation from
the apache directory studio project.  Furthermore, I have added
a test that leverages a real binary/string SID pair retrieved
from an active directory domain controller.  The apache2-based
implementation is exempt for the license checker.
