Allow copying from a field to another field that belongs to the same nested object. (#26774)

The previous test was too strict and enforced that the target object was a
parent. It has been relaxed so that fields that belong to the same nested
object can copy to each other.

The commit also improves error handling in case of multi-fields. The current
validation works but may throw confusing error messages since it assumes that
only object fields may introduce dots in fields names while multi fields may
too.

Closes #26763
