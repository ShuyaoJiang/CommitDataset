Add BlobContainer.writeBlobAtomic() (#30902)

This commit adds a new writeBlobAtomic() method to the BlobContainer
interface that can be implemented by repository implementations which
support atomic writes operations.

When the BlobContainer implementation does not provide a specific 
implementation of writeBlobAtomic(), then the writeBlob() method is used.
