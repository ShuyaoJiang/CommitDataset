Watcher: Move watcher-only packages into watcher hierarchy (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2933)

In order to prepare for separate source directories, this commit moves
a few packages back into the watcher namespaces. A few of them have been
moved out previously as we thought that it might make sense to have a
dedicated notification API. This wont be the case for watcher on ES
anymore, so we can safely move those back into the watcher space.

Packages affected by this move:

* org.elasticsearch.xpack.common.http
* org.elasticsearch.xpack.common.text
* org.elasticsearch.xpack.common.secret
* org.elasticsearch.xpack.common.stats
* org.elasticsearch.xpack.support
* org.elasticsearch.xpack.notification

Tests have been moved accordingly.

The class `XContentUtils` has been split into one implementation for
watcher and one for security as different methods were used.
