Preserve thread context when connecting to remote cluster (#31574)

Establishing remote cluster connections uses a queue to coordinate multiple concurrent connect
attempts. Connect attempts can be initiated by user triggered searches as well as by system events 
(e.g. when nodes disconnect). Multiple such concurrent events can lead to the connectListener of
one event to be called under the thread context of another connect attempt. This can lead to the
situation as seen in #31462 where the connect listener is executed under the system context, which 
breaks when fetching the search shards from the remote cluster.

Closes #31462
