[Test] Reactive 3rd party tests on CI (#31919)

3rd party tests are failing because the repository-s3 is expecting some 
enviromnent variables in order to test session tokens but the CI job is 
not ready yet to provide those. This pull request relaxes the constraints 
on the presence of env vars so that the 3rd party tests can still be 
executed on CI.
