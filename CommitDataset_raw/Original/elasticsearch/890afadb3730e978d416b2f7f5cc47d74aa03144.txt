[test] packaging: add windows boxes (#30402)

Adds windows server 2012r2 and 2016 vagrant boxes to packaging tests.
They can only be used if IDs for their images are specified, which are
passed to gradle and then to vagrant via env variables. Adds options
to the project property `vagrant.boxes` to choose between linux and
windows boxes.

Bats tests are run only on linux boxes, and portable packaging tests run
on all boxes. Platform tests are only run on linux boxes since they are
not being maintained.
