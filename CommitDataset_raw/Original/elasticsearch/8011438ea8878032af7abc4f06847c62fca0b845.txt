Use correct source of randomness

This fixes a failure of InternalTestClusterTests#testBeforeTest which checks
that the cluster is set up the same when starting from the same seed. Trappily,
using ESTestCase#randomIntBetween() is no good, we have to use
InternalTestCluster#random via RandomNumbers#randomIntBetween() instead.
