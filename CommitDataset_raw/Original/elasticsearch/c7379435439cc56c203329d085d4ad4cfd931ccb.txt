Primary replica resync should not send ops without seqno (#40433)

Primary-replica resync in a mixed-cluster between 6.x and 5.6 can send
operations without sequence number to a replica which already processed
operations with sequence number. This leads to the failure of that
replica for we trip the sequence number assertion when writing resync
operations without sequence number to translog.
