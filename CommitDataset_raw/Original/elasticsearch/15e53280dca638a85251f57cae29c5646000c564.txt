[ML] Allow datafeed to start when job is opening (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1611)

The goal of this change is to allow datafeeds to start
when the job is in the opening state. This makes the API
more async and it allows clients like the ML UI to open a
job and start its datafeed without having to manage the
complexity of dealing with timeouts due to the job taking
time to open due to restoring a large state.

In order to achieve this, this commit does a number of things:

  - accepts a start datafeed request when the job is opening
  - adds logic to the DatafeedManager to wait before running the
  datafeed task until the job is opened
  - refactord the datafeed node selection logic into its own class
  - splitd selection issues in critical and non-critical with regard
  to creating the datafeed task
  - refactord the unit tests to make simpler to write & understand
  - adds unit tests for added and modified functionality
  - changes the response when the datafeed cannot be started to
  be a conflict exception
