Remove discovery-file plugin (#33257)

In #33241 we moved the file-based discovery functionality to core
Elasticsearch, but preserved the `discovery-file` plugin, and support for the
existing location of the `unicast_hosts.txt` file, for BWC reasons. This commit
completes the removal of this plugin.
