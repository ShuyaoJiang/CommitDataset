Name the log tail thread and mark it as a daemon

This commit provides an explicit name for the log tail thread, otherwise
the thread shows up with a generic name like Thread-12 in stack
dumps. While the stack trace provides enough information to conclude
what this thread is doing, it is better to be more explicit about the
purpose of this thread so that that can be discerned directly from the
name of the thread.

Additionally, we mark this thread as a daemon thread. Since this thread
is created by the main thread during node initialization it defaults to
being a user thread. Since the JVM only exits when the only threads
running are not user threads, if this thread were to somehow block then
it could prevent the server JVM from exiting. As such, this thread
should be marked as a daemon thread.
