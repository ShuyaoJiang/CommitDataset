Update audit trail filter policy settings (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3984)

Audit trail filter policies can now be updated by the cluster update
settings API. Previously, policies were static inside the conf file.
This is helpful because, in practice, coming up with a reasonable
policy set is an iterative process, adding and changing policies to
shave off yet another pesky audit event.
