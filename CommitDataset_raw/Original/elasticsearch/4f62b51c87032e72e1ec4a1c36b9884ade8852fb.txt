Use lastSyncedGlobalCheckpoint in deletion policy (#27826)

Today we use the in-memory global checkpoint from SequenceNumbersService
to clean up unneeded commit points, however the latest global checkpoint
may haven't fsynced to the disk yet. If the translog checkpoint fsync
failed and we already use a higher global checkpoint to clean up commit
points, then we may have removed a safe commit which we try to keep for
recovery.

This commit updates the deletion policy using lastSyncedGlobalCheckpoint
from Translog rather the in memory global checkpoint.
