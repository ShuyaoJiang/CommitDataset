GET aliases should 404 if aliases are missing

Previously the HEAD and GET aliases endpoints were misaigned in
behavior. The HEAD verb would 404 if any aliases are missing while the
GET verb would not if any aliases existed. When HEAD was aligned with
GET, this broke the previous usage of HEAD to serve as an existence
check for aliases. It is the behavior of GET that is problematic here
though, if any alias is missing the request should 404. This commit
addresses this by modifying the behavior of GET to behave in this
way. This fixes the behavior for HEAD to also 404 when aliases are
missing.
