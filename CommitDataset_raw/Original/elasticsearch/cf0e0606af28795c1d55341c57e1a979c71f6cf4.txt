Use geohash cell instead of just a corner in geo_bounding_box (#30698)

Treats geohashes as grid cells instead of just points when the
geohashes are used to specify the edges in the geo_bounding_box
query. For example, if a geohash is used to specify the top_left
corner, the top left corner of the geohash cell will be used as the
corner of the bounding box.
