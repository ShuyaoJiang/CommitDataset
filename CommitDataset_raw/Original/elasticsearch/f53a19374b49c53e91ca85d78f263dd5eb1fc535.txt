SQL: Wrap coercion in JdbcResultSet to throw SQLException (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3559)

* SQL: Wrap coercion in JdbcResultSet to throw SQLException

This catches the `ClassCastException` that could be thrown when retrieving data
from a result set, instead converting it into a `SQLException`.

Resolves elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3207

* Add simple test for incorrect coercion
