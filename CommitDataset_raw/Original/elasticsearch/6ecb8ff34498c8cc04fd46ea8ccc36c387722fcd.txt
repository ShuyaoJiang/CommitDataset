Move to Error step if ClusterState* steps throw (#35069)

Previously, if ClusterStateActionSteps or ClusterStateWaitSteps threw an
exception executing, the exception would only be caught and logged by
the generic ClusterStateUpdateTask machinery and the index would become
stuck on that step.

Now, exceptions thrown in these steps will be caught and the index will
be moved to the Error step.
