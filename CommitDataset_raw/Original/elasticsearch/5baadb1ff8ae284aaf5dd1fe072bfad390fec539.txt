Template upgrades should happen in a system context (#30621)

The TemplateUpgradeService is a system service that allows for plugins
to register templates that need to be upgraded. These template upgrades
should always happen in a system context as they are not a user
initiated action. For security integrations, the lack of running this
in a system context could lead to unexpected failures. The changes in
this commit set an empty system context for the execution of the
template upgrades performed by this service.
