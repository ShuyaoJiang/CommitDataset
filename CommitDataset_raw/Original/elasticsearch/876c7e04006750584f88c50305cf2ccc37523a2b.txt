Fix random score generation when no seed is provided. (#25908)

It fixes random score generation to ensure that you will not always get the
same scores on a read-only index by integrating the seed into the score
computation when using doc ids. It also removes `ctx.docBase` from the formula
since it might change over time if deletes are compacted while scores are
supposed to be cacheable per segment.
