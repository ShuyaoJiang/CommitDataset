TEST: testDocStats should always use forceMerge (#32450)

Due to the recent change in LUCENE-8263, we need to adjust the deletion
ration to between 10% to 33% to preserve the current behavior of the
test. However, we may need another refinement if soft-deletes is enabled
as the actual deletes are different because of delete tombstones.

This commit prefers to always execute forceMerge instead of adjusting
the deletion ratio so that this test can focus on testing docStats.

Closes #32449
