SQL: Expose WEEK function and document datetime functions (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3680)

Adds documentation for all of the date time functions using the new
cli-like format extracted from the csv spec. In the process of doing
this I noticed that the `WEEK` function isn't exposed as a function.
This exposes it for consistency.

Relates to elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2898
