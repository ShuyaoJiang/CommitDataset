Java Time: Fix timezone parsing (#37262)

* Java Time: Fix timezone parsing

An independent test uncovered an issue when parsing a timezone
containing a colon like `01:00` - some formats did not properly support
this.

This commit adds test for all formats in the dueling tests and fixes a
few issues with existing date formatters.

* fix tests, so they run under java8
