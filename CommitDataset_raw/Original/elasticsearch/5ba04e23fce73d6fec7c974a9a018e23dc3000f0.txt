[ML] Add log structure finder functionality (#32788)

This change adds a library to ML that can be used to deduce a log
file's structure given only a sample of the log file.

Eventually this will be used to add an endpoint to ML to make the
functionality available to end users, but this will follow in a
separate change.

The functionality is split into a library so that it can also be
used by a command line tool without requiring the command line
tool to include all server code.
