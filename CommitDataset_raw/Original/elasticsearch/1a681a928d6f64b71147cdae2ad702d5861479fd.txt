Modify cluster state callback in recovery land

We use a callback in recovery land during primary relocation to ensure
the relocation target is on at least the same version as the relocation
source. This callback is typed as a Callback<Long> which is an
unnecessary custom type (we can use Consumer<T> or the appropriate
primitive callbacks). Here, we can use LongConsumer.
