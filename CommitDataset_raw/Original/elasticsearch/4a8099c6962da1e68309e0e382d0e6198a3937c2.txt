Change BroadcastResponse from ToXContentFragment to ToXContentObject (#28878)

While working on #27799, we find that it might make sense to change BroadcastResponse from ToXContentFragment to ToXContentObject, seeing that it's rather a complete XContent object and also the other Responses are normally ToXContentObject.

By doing this, we can also move the XContent build logic of BroadcastResponse's subclasses, from Rest Layer to the concrete classes themselves.

Relates to #3889
