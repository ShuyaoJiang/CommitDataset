Remove SslNullCipherTests from codebase (#37431)

This change deletes the SslNullCipherTests from our codebase since it
will have issues with newer JDK versions and it is essentially testing
JDK functionality rather than our own. The upstream JDK issue for
disabling these ciphers by default is
https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8212823.

Closes #37403
