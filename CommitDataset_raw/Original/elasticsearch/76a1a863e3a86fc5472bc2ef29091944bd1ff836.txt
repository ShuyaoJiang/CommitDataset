TEST: stop assertSeqNos if shards movement (#33875)

Currently, assertSeqNos assumes that the cluster is stable at the end of
the test (i.e., no more shard movement). However, this assumption does
not always hold. In these cases, we can stop the assertion instead of
failing a test.

Closes #33704
