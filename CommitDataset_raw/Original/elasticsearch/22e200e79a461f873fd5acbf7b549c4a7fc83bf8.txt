Remove deprecated type and slop field in MatchQueryBuilder (#26720)

The `type` field has been deprecated in 5.0 and can be removed. It has been
replaced by using the MatchPhraseQueryBuilder or the
MatchPhrasePrefixQueryBuilder. The `slop` field has also been deprecated and can
be removed, the phrase and phrase prefix query builders still provide this
parameter.
