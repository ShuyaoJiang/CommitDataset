[Security] Don't apply local restrictions on remote cluster search (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1609)

This change removes all local security checks against remote cluster names.
Any user is allowed to attempt a cross-cluster search, and it is the responsibility of the remote cluster to authorise the search (or not).

This includes support for remote searches even if you have _no_ local search privileges.
