[ML] Wait for autodetect to be ready in the datafeed (#37349)

This is a reinforcement of #37227.  It turns out that
persistent tasks are not made stale if the node they
were running on is restarted and the master node does
not notice this.  The main scenario where this happens
is when minimum master nodes is the same as the number
of nodes in the cluster, so the cluster cannot elect a
master node when any node is restarted.

When an ML node restarts we need the datafeeds for any
jobs that were running on that node to not just wait
until the jobs are allocated, but to wait for the
autodetect process of the job to start up.  In the case
of reassignment of the job persistent task this was
dealt with by the stale status test.  But in the case
where a node restarts but its persistent tasks are not
reassigned we need a deeper test.

Fixes #36810
