Switch mapping/aggregations over to java time (#36363)

This commit moves the aggregation and mapping code from joda time to
java time. This includes field mappers, root object mappers, aggregations with date
histograms, query builders and a lot of changes within tests.

The cut-over to java time is a requirement so that we can support nanoseconds
properly in a future field mapper.
