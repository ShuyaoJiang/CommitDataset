Java api: Remove unneeded getTookInMillis method (#23923)

Some response classes in the java api expose both `getTook()` which returns a `TimeValue` and `getTookInMillis` which returns a `long` value. `getTook()` is enough as one can do `getTook().millis()` to obtain the same result as `getTookInMillis()`, which can be removed.
