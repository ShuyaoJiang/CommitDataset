Consistently use loopback address for ssl profile (#37487)

This change fixes failures in the SslMultiPortTests where we attempt to
connect to a profile on a port it is listening on but the connection
fails. The failure is due to the profile being bound to multiple
addresses and randomization will pick one of these addresses to
determine the listening port. However, the address we get the port for
may not be the address we are actually connecting to. In order to
resolve this, the test now sets the bind host for profiles to the
loopback address and uses the same address for connecting.
