Remove deprecated FieldNamesFieldMapper.Builder#index (#37305)

The method calls "enabled" in addition to what the super.index() does, but this
seems to be done explicitely now in the TypeParsers `parse` method. The removed
method has been deprecated since at least 6.0. Also making some of the Builders
methods and ctos private since they are only used internally in this class.
