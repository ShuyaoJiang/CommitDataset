Extend JVM options to support multiple versions

JDK 9 has removed JVM options that were valid in JDK 8 (e.g., GC logging
flags) and replaced them with new flags that are not available in JDK
8. This means that a single JVM options file can no longer apply to JDK
8 and JDK 9, complicating development, complicating our packaging story,
and complicating operations. This commit extends the JVM options syntax
to specify the range of versions the option applies to. If the running
JVM matches the range of versions, the flag will be used to start the
JVM otherwise the flag will be ignored.

We implement this parser in Java for simplicity, and with this we start
our first step towards a Java launcher.
