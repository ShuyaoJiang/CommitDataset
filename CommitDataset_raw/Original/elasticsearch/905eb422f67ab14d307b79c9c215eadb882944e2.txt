Use StringBuilder to construct a String instead of relying on appending where possible (#24753)

This PR revolves around places in the code where introducing a StringBuilder might make the construction
of a String easier to follow and also, maybe avoid a case where the compiler's very safe way of introducing 
StringBuilder instead of String might not always be optimal for performance.
