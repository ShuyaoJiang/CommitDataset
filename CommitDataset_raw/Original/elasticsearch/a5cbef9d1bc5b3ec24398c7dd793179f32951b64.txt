Rebuild remote connections on profile changes (#37678)

Currently remote compression and ping schedule settings are dynamic.
However, we do not listen for changes. This commit adds listeners for
changes to those two settings. Additionally, when those settings change
we now close existing connections and open new ones with the settings
applied.

Fixes #37201.
