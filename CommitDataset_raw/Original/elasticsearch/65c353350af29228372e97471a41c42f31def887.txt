Add safer empty variable checking for Windows

We need to check if JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS, and JAVA_OPTS are set, and if
ES_PATH_CONF is not set. However, if these variables are defined and
contain quotes, the current mechanism busts on them. Instead, we should
use safer mechanism for checking if these variable are defined or
not. This commit does that.
