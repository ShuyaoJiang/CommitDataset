Add term and config to cluster state (#32100)

Adds the publication term and the last accepted and committed configurations to the cluster state,
following the formal model in
https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-formal-models/blob/master/ZenWithTerms/tla/ZenWithTerms.tla
The term represents the reign of a master, and the last committed / accepted configurations
represent the set of quorums that cluster state changes will require (If there's no reconfiguration,
last accepted and last committed configurations coincide).
