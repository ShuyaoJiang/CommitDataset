[Scripting] Make Max Script Length Setting Dynamic (#35184)

This changes the current script.max_size_in_bytes to be dynamic so it can be 
set through the cluster settings API. This setting is also applied to inline scripts 
in the compile method of ScriptService to prevent excessively long inline 
scripts from being compiled. The script length limit is removed from Painless as 
this is no longer necessary with the protection in compile.
