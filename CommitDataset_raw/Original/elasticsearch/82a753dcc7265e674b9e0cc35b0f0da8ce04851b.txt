Enable license header exclusions (#29379)

There are some scenarios where the license on a source file is one that
is compatible with our projects yet we do not want to add the license to
the list of approved license headers (to keep the number of files with
that compatible license contained). This commit adds the ability to
exclude a file from the license check.
