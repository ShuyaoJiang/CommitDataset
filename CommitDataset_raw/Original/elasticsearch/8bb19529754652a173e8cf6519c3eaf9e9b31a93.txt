Fix NodeJoinTests again (#36133)

In #36033 we removed a catch block because we thought we were preventing
exceptions by avoiding concurrent elections, missing the obvious fact that some
joins are supposed to be failing.

As a quick fix the catch was reinstated in 3a5dab6d8ef23ba3cb60162e9e2b7e002145
but this change adds finesse by only catching exceptions from the joins that we
expect to fail. It also inlines an always-false parameter to `initialState()`.
