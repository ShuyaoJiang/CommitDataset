Update Painless to Use New Script Contexts (#25015)

*  All public methods starting with get will be added as local variables
to the execute method.
* The execute method on a ScriptContext must be both public and
abstract.  This method will be implemented by the Painless compiler.
* A static list of parameter names for the execute method must be
provided since the names will be eliminated at runtime.
* The uses$ methods will still be implemented as before.
* A single constructor may be provided by the ScriptContext.  This
constructor will be overridden by the Painless compiler to include the
exact same arguments.  This allows instances of a Painless script to
potentially contain state.  If a constructor is not provided it is
assumed the default constructor with no arguments will be used.
