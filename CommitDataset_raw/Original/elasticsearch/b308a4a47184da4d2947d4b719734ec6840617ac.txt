Changes PhaseAfterStep to take the name of the previous phase (#30756)

* Changes PhaseAfterStep to take the name of the previous phase

This changes the way the phase after step is built so its key has the
phase name of the phase that preceeds it rather than the phase that
follows it. This is more intuitive to the user since the index is in
the warm phase until the after condition for the cold phase is met.

* Fixes REST tests
