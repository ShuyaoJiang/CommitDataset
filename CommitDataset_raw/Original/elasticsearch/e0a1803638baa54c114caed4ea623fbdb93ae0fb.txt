Add Debug/Trace logging to token service (#34022)

The token service has fairly strict validation and there are a range
of reasons why request may be rejected.
The detail is typically returned in the client exception / json body
but the ES admin can only debug that if they have access to detailed
logs from the client.

This commit adds debug & trace logging to the token service so that it
is possible to perform this debugging from the server side if
necessary.
