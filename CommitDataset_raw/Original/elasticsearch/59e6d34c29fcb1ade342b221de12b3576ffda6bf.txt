SQL: Bundle the CLI into x-pack (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3316)

This adds:

* The CLI jar itself into the `bin`. It is an executable jar.
* A shell and bat script to start the CLI. This isn't strictly required but folks will appreciate the consistency.
* Basic packaging tests for the CLI.

Relates to elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2979
