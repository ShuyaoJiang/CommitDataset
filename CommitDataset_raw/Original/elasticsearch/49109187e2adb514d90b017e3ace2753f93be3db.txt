Remove unsupported group_shard_failures parameter (#33208)

We have had support for the `group_shard_failures` parameter in our code for a while, since we introduced failures grouping. When we introduced validation of parameters at REST, we seem to have forgotten to expose such parameter. Given that the parameter is effectively not supported for many months now, that no user has complained about that and that grouping is the expected behaviour, this commit removes support for the parameter.
