TemplateUpgraders should be called during rolling restart (#25263)

In #24379 we added ability to upgrade templates on full cluster startup. This PR invokes the same update procedure also when a new node first joins the cluster allowing to update templates on a rolling cluster restart as well.

Closes #24680
