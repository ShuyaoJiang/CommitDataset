Track deletes only in the tombstone map instead of maintaining as copy (#27868)

Today we maintain a copy of every delete in the live version maps. This is unnecessary
and might add quite some overhead if maps grow large. This change moves out the deletes
tracking into the tombstone map only and relies on the cleaning of tombstones when deletes
are collected.
