Allow `ClusterState.Custom` to be created on initial cluster states (#26144)

Today we have a `null` invariant on all `ClusterState.Custom`. This makes
several code paths complicated and requires complex state handling in some cases.
This change allows to register a custom supplier that is used to initialize the
initial clusterstate with these transient customs.
