Support multiple system store types (#31650)

Support multiple system store types

When falling back to using the system keystore and - most usually -
truststore, do not assume that it will be a JKS store, but deduct
its type from {@code KeyStore#getDefaultKeyStoreType}. This allows
the use of any store type the Security Provider supports by setting
the keystore.type java security property.
