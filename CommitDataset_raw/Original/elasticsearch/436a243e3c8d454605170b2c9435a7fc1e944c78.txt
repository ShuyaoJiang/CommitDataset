Set global checkpoint before open engine from store (#27972)

In PR #27965, we set the global checkpoint from the translog in a store
recovery. However, we set after an engine is opened. This causes the
global checkpoint assertion in TranslogWriter violated as if we are
forced to close the engine before we set the global checkpoint. A
closing engine will close translog which in turn read the current global
checkpoint; however it is still unassigned and smaller than the initial
global checkpoint from translog.

Closes #27970
