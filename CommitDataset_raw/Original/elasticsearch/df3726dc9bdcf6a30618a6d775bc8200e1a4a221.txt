Rename and deprecated `prefix` logfile audit setting names (#34475)

The logfile audit log format is no longer formed by prefix fields followed
by key value fields, it is all formed by key value fields only (JSON format).

Consequently, the following settings, which toggled some of the prefix
fields, have been renamed:
audit.logfile .prefix.emit_node_host_address
audit.logfile .prefix.emit_node_host_name
audit.logfile .prefix.emit_node_name
