SQL: Extend field resolution to deal with unquoted qualified columns (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3894)

* foo.bar can mean either: no table field foo.bar or table foo, field bar
The resolution rule has been extended to include the latter case as
fallback.
* Always check field ambiguity
* Since field with dots can create confusion (when not qualified), the
analyzer always now always checks for both qualified and not-qualified
fields and throws an ambiguity message with the potential candidates.
This forces the use of qualifiers or quotes to better indicate the
desired field.
* Add example of aliasing the table to remove ambiguity
