Removing unused methods in Numbers (#37186)

Remove several unused helper methods. Most of them are one-liners and should 
be easier to be used from the corresponding primitive wrapper classes. 
The bytes array conversion methods are unused as well, it should be easy to 
re-create them if needed.
