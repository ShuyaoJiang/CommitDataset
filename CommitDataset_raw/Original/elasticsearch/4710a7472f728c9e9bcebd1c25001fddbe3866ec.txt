SQL: Implement FIRST/LAST aggregate functions (#37936)

FIRST and LAST can be used with one argument and work similarly to MIN
and MAX but they are implemented using a Top Hits aggregation and
therefore can also operate on keyword fields. When a second argument is
provided then they return the first/last value of the first arg when its
values are ordered ascending/descending (respectively) by the values of
the second argument. Currently because of the usage of a Top Hits
aggregation FIRST and LAST cannot be used in the HAVING clause of a
GROUP BY query to filter on the results of the aggregation.
