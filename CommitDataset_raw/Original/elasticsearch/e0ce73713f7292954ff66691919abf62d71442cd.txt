[ML] Stop datafeeds running when their jobs are stale (#37227)

We already had logic to stop datafeeds running against
jobs that were OPENING, but a job that relocates from
one node to another while OPENED stays OPENED, and this
could cause the datafeed to fail when it sent data to
the OPENED job on its new node before it had a
corresponding autodetect process.

This change extends the check to stop datafeeds running
when their job is OPENING _or_ stale (i.e. has not had
its status reset since relocating to a different node).
