Cleanup split strings by comma method

We have some methods Strings#splitStringByCommaToArray and
Strings#splitStringByCommaToSet. It is not obvious that the former
leaves whitespace and the latter trims it. We also have
Strings#tokenizeToStringArray which tokenizes a string to an array, and
trims whitespace. It seems the right thing to do here is to rename
Strings#splitStringByCommaToSet to Strings#tokenizeByCommaToSet so that
its name is aligned with another method that tokenizes by a delimiter
and trims whitespace. We also cleanup the code here, removing an
unneeded splitting by delimiter to set method.
