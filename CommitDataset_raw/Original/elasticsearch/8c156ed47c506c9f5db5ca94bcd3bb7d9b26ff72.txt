Introduce forget follower API (#39718)

This commit introduces the forget follower API. This API is needed in cases that
unfollowing a following index fails to remove the shard history retention leases
on the leader index. This can happen explicitly through user action, or
implicitly through an index managed by ILM. When this occurs, history will be
retained longer than necessary. While the retention lease will eventually
expire, it can be expensive to allow history to persist for that long, and also
prevent ILM from performing actions like shrink on the leader index. As such, we
introduce an API to allow for manual removal of the shard history retention
leases in this case.
