Allow SearchOperationListeners to validate a search context (#24650)

This commit adds a new method to the SearchOperationListener that allows implementers to validate
the SearchContext immediately after it is retrieved from the active contexts. The listener may
throw a runtime exception if it deems the SearchContext is not valid and that the use of the context
should be terminated.
