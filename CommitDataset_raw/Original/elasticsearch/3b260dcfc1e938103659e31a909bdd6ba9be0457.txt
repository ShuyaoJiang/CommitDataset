[ML] Account for gaps in data counts after job is reopened (#30294)

This commit fixes an issue with the data diagnostics were
empty buckets are not reported even though they should. Once
a job is reopened, the diagnostics do not get initialized from
the current data counts (especially the latest record timestamp).
The result is that if the data that is sent have a time gap compared
to the previous ones, that gap is not accounted for in the empty bucket
count.

This commit fixes that by initializing the diagnostics with the current
data counts.

Closes #30080
