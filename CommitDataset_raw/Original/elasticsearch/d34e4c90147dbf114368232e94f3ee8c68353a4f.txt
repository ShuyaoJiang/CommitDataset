Dump recovery if fail to get doc count with preference (#40168)

With this change, we will dump the recovery state if we fail to get doc
count for a given index with a preference in rolling upgrade tests. We
should have more information to look into why the provided preference is
not valid. I also unmuted `testRelocationWithConcurrentIndexing` in this
change.
