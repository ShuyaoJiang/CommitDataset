MinimumMasterNodesIT changed for Zen2 (#37428)

There were 5 tests in MinimumMasterNodesIT. 2 of them removed, 3 of
them changed and renamed.
1) testSimpleMinimumMasterNodes -> testTwoNodesNoMasterBlock. The
flow of this test is left intact but in order to make it work on
Zen2, additional work for the cluster bootstrapping and voting
exclusions is needed. 
2) testDynamicUpdateMinimumMasterNodes -> removed, there is nothing
that corresponds to the dynamic change of the minimum master nodes
setting.
3) testCanNotBringClusterDown -> removed, it also plays with changing
minimum master nodes dynamically.
4) testMultipleNodesShutdownNonMasterNodes ->
testThreeNodesNoMasterBlock. Previously this test was checking that
there would be no master block, if min_master_nodes=3 and 4 nodes are
started, then 2 nodes are brought down. Zen2 dynamically accommodates
to the number of nodes in the cluster, so it's possible that there
still will be a master in 2 nodes cluster. For Zen2, we start up 3
nodes. And shut down 2 of them (w/o voting exclusions), which results
in no master block.
5) testCanNotPublishWithoutMinMastNodes ->
testCanNotCommitStateThreeNodes. Test flow is not changed. But
previously there was no check that nodes in the bigger part of
network partition will elect the master, before healing the network
partition. For Zen2 it does not work, because persistent setting
addition is accepted on the old master and if it's elected new master
again, this setting will appear in the cluster state.

Also, I have a feeling that we need to remove this class, but could not
come up with a good name.
