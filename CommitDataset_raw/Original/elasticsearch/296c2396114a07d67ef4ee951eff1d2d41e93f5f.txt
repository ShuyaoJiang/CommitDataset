Add check for invalid index in WildcardExpressionResolver (#26409)

This commit adds validation to the resolving of indexes in the wildcard
expression resolver. It no longer throws a 404 Not Found when resolving
invalid indices. It throws a 400 instead, as it is an invalid
index. This was the behavior of 5.x.
