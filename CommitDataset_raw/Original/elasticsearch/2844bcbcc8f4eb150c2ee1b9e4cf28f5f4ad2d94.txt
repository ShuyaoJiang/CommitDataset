Enable installing plugins from snapshots.elastic.co (#30765)

We post snapshot builds to snapshots.elastic.co yet the official plugin
installer will not let you install such plugins without manually
downloading them and installing them from a file URL. This commit adds
the ability for the plugin installer to use snapshots.elastic.co for
installing official plugins if a es.plugins.staging is set and the
current build is also a snapshot build. Otherwise, we continue to use
staging.elastic.co if the current build is a release build and
es.plugins.staging is set and, of course, use the release artifacts at
artifacts.elastic.co for release builds with es.plugins.staging unset.
