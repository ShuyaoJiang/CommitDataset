add new phase definition setting used for retrieving phase to execute (#33289)

Since policies can be updated independent of execution plans for the current
phase being executed, it would be nice to know what the phase that is executing
looks like in JSON. This PR does just that, while also using that index setting
to recontruct the phase steps to execute (for consistency)
