Do not load global state when deleting a snapshot (#29278)

When deleting a snapshot, it is not necessary to load and to parse the
global metadata of the snapshot to delete. Now indices are stored in
the snapshot metadata file, we have all the information to resolve the
shards files to delete.

This commit removes the readSnapshotMetaData() method that was used to
load both global and index metadata files. Test coverage should be
enough as SharedClusterSnapshotRestoreIT already contains several
deletion tests.
