Scripting: Remove "service" from ScriptEngine interface name (#24574)

This commit renames ScriptEngineService to ScriptEngine.  It is often
confusing because we have the ScriptService, and then
ScriptEngineService implementations, but the latter are not services as
we see in other places in elasticsearch.
