[Zen2] Reconfigure cluster as its membership changes (#34592)

As master-eligible nodes join or leave the cluster we should give them votes or
take them away, in order to maintain the optimal level of fault-tolerance in
the system. #33924 introduced the `Reconfigurator` to calculate the optimal
configuration of the cluster, and in this change we add the plumbing needed to
actually perform the reconfigurations needed as the cluster grows or shrinks.
