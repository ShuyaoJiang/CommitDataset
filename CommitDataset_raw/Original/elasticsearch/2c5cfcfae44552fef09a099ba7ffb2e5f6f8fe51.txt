SQL: Proper errors on set qualifiers (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3377)

`SELECT DISTINCT foo FROM bar` is not yet implemented and was returning
an "unplanned item" error which isn't useful to users so I replaced it
with `SELECT DISTINCT is not yet supported`.

`SELECT foo, COUNT(*) FROM bar GROUP BY ALL foo` is not supported.
Specifically the `ALL` part. It is fairly esoteric so see [1] for what
it does. Regardless of what it does it is not widely supported and even
Microsoft's SQL Server has deprecated it so we should never support it.
Probably.
