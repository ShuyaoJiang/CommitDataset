Also skip JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS on Windows

On non-Windows platforms, we ignore the environment variable
JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS (this is an environment variable that the JVM respects
by default for picking up extra JVM options). The primary reason that we
ignore this because of the Jayatana agent on Ubuntu; a secondary reason
is that it produces an annoying "Picked up JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS: ..."
output message. When the elasticsearch-env batch script was introduced
for Windows, ignoring this environment variable was deliberately not
carried over as the primary reason does not apply on Windows. However,
after additional thinking, it seems that we should simply be consistent
to the extent possible here (and also avoid that annoying "Picked up
JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS: ..." on Windows too). This commit causes the Windows
version of elasticsearch-env to also ignore JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS.
