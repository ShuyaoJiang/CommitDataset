ReadOnlyEngine should update translog recovery state information (#39238)

`ReadOnlyEngine` never recovers operations from translog and never 
updates translog information in the index shard's recovery state, even 
though the recovery state goes through the `TRANSLOG` stage during 
the recovery. It means that recovery information for frozen shards indicates 
an unkown number of recovered translog ops in the Recovery APIs 
(translog_ops: `-1` and translog_ops_percent: `-1.0%`) and this is confusing.

This commit changes the `recoverFromTranslog()` method in `ReadOnlyEngine` 
so that it always recover from an empty translog snapshot, allowing the recovery 
state translog information to be correctly updated.
