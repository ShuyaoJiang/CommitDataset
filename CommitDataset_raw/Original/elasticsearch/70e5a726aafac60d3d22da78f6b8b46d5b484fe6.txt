Only flush Watcher's bulk processor if Watcher is enabled (#38803)

When shutting down Watcher, the `bulkProcessor` is null if watcher has been
disabled in the configuration. This protects the flush and close calls with a
check for watcher enabled to avoid a NullPointerException

Resolves #38798
