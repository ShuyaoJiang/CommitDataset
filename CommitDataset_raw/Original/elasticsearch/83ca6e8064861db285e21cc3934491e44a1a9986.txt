[ML] Report errors back to listener in DeleteExpiredDataAction (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3072)

Currently, any errors that occur during the DeleteExpiredDataAction are logged and the deletion proceeds to the next job. The user will get no indication in the response that something went wrong although nothing should really go wrong unless the cluster is messed up.

This commit changes this so that errors are reported back to the action.
