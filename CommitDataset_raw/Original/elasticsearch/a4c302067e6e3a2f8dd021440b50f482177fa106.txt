HLRC: Create/Update role mapping API (#34171)

We added support for role mapper expression DSL in #33745,
that allows us to build the role mapper expression used in the
role mapping (as rules for determining user roles based on what
the boolean expression resolves to).

This change now adds support for create/update role mapping
API to the high-level rest client.
