Do not alloc full buffer for small change requests (#35158)

Today we always allocate a full buffer (1024 elements) in a
LuceneChangesSnapshot even though the requesting size is smaller.
With this change, we will use the requesting size as the buffer size if
it's smaller than the default batch size; otherwise uses the default
batch size.
