Use hostname instead of IP with SPNEGO test (#32514)

This change updates KerberosAuthenticationIT to resolve the host used
to connect to the test cluster. This is needed because the host could
be an IP address but SPNEGO requires a hostname to work properly. This
is done by adding a hook in ESRestTestCase for building the HttpHost
from the host and port.

Additionally, the project now specifies the IPv4 loopback address as
the http host. This is done because we need to be able to resolve the
address used for the HTTP transport before the node starts up, but the
http.ports file is not written until the node is started.

Closes #32498
