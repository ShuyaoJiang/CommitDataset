Improve explanation in rescore (#30629)

Currently in a rescore request if window_size is smaller than
the top N documents returned (N=size), explanation of scores could be incorrect
for documents that were a part of topN and not part of rescoring.
This PR corrects this, but saving in RescoreContext docIDs of documents
for which rescoring was applied, and adding rescoring explanation
only for these docIDs.

Closes #28725
