Don't disable tasks based on the plugin (#36045)

Some times the test fixtures plugin did not correctly disable tasks
from the build plugin as it should.
The plugin manager and tasks both use domain name collections so
the previus conde should have worked.
I did not have trime to track it down, but suspect there's some race
condition in Gradle causing this. The plugin manager is still incubating.
Since the tasks are on the cp even if the plugin is not applyed, we
don't really  need to involve the plugin at all.

Closes #36041
