Skip Shrink when numberOfShards not changed (#37953)

Previously, ShrinkAction would fail if
it was executed on an index that had
the same number of shards as the target
shrunken number.

This PR introduced a new BranchingStep that
is used inside of ShrinkAction to branch which
step to move to next, depending on the
shard values. So no shrink will occur if the
shard count is unchanged.
