Fix byte size value equals/hash code test (#29643)

This commit fixes two issues with the byte size value equals/hash code
test.

The first problem is due to a test failure when the original instance is
zero bytes and we pick the mutation branch where we preserve the size
but change the unit. The mutation should result in a different byte size
value but changing the unit on zero bytes still leaves us with zero
bytes.

During the course of fixing this test I discovered another problem. When
we need to randomize size, we could randomly select a size that would
lead to an overflow of Long.MAX_VALUE.

This commit fixes both of these issues.
