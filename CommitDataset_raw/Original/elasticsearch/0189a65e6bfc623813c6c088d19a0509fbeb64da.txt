Fail rest tests on yaml files (#24740)

We've switched to supporting only `yml` files but anyone who didn't
notice will commit a `yaml` file which won't be executed
which is bad because it is easy not to notice. The test to catch this is
simple enough that I think it is worth adding just to warn folks about
their mistake.
