Use ILM for Watcher history deletion (#37443)

* Use ILM for Watcher history deletion

This commit adds an index lifecycle policy for the `.watch-history-*` indices.
This policy is automatically used for all new watch history indices.

This does not yet remove the automatic cleanup that the monitoring plugin does
for the .watch-history indices, and it does not touch the
`xpack.watcher.history.cleaner_service.enabled` setting.

Relates to #32041
