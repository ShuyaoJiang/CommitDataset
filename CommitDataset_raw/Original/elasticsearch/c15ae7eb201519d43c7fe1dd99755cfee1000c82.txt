Build: Add release flag to groovy compilation (#28277)

The build-tools project (ie buildSrc) has groovy code. The -source
option was set to java 8, but this is not correct on java 9, and
actually causes a warning about not setting boot classpath. This commit
adds the --release option to groovy compilation, just like is done for
java compilation.
