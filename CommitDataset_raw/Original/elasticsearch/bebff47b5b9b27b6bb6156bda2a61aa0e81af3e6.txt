File Discovery: Remove fallback with zen discovery (#26667)

When adding file based discovery, we added a fallback when the discovery
type was set to zen (the default, so everyone got this warning). This
commit removes the fallback for 6.0. Setting file discovery should now
happen explicitly through the hosts_provider setting.

closes #26661
