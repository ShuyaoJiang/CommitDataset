Remove ElasticsearchQueryCachingPolicy (#27190)

We have an hidden setting called `index.queries.cache.term_queries` that disables caching of term queries in the query cache.
Though term queries are not cached in the Lucene UsageTrackingQueryCachingPolicy since version 6.5.
This makes the es policy useless but also makes it impossible to re-enable caching for term queries.
This change appeared in Lucene 6.5 so this setting is no-op since version 5.4 of Elasticsearch
The change in this PR removes the setting and the custom policy.
