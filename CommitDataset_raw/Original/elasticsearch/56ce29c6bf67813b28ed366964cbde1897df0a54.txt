Security tests for SQL's CLI and JDBC (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2770)

Add security tests for SQL's CLI and JDBC features. I do this by factoring out all the "actions" from the existing REST tests into an interface and implement it for REST, CLI, and JDBC. This way we can share the same audit log assertions across tests and we can be sure that the REST, CLI, and JDBC tests cover all the same use cases.
