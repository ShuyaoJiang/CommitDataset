Initialize primary term for shrunk indices

Today when an index is shrunk, the primary terms for its shards start
from one. Yet, this is a problem as the index will already contain
assigned sequence numbers across primary terms. To ensure document-level
sequence number semantics, the primary terms of the target shards must
start from the maximum of all the shards in the source index. This
commit causes this to be the case.
