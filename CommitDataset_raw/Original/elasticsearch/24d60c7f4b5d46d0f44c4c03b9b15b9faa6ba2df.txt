Fix from_range in search_after in changes snapshot (#33335)

We can have multiple documents in Lucene with the same seq_no for
parent-child documents (or without rollback). In this case, the usage
"lastSeenSeqNo + 1" is an off-by-one error as it may miss some
documents. This error merely affects the `skippedOperations` contract.

Closes #33318
