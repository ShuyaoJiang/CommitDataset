[Monitoring] Register affixed Header Setting (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3893)

This adds the `HEADERS_SETTING` as setting reported by the Monitoring plugin, which was changed in 6.2.

It also adds an IT to ensure that it is not missed in the future (existing integration tests were passing in the Settings and not being validated by the cluster!).
