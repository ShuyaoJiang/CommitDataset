Watcher: Fix SmokeTestWatcherWithSecurityIT test (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#4140)

These tests were configured to run every second, some of the watch
history entries could have an execution state throttled, when two
executions happened while waiting. The tests who were affected by 
this are now explicitely searching for the watch history entry with 
the correct state.
