Remove LocalCheckpointTracker#resetCheckpoint (#34667)

In #34474, we added a new assertion to ensure that the
LocalCheckpointTracker is always consistent with Lucene index. However,
we reset LocalCheckpoinTracker in testDedupByPrimaryTerm cause this
assertion to be violated.

This commit removes resetCheckpoint from LocalCheckpointTracker and
rewrites testDedupByPrimaryTerm without resetting the local checkpoint.
