Indices PUT Mapping API docs: Remove mapping type user and rephrase first sentence (#28998)

The current docs on [Indices APIs: PUT Mapping](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-put-mapping.html) suggests that a having number of different mapping types per index is still possible in elasticsearch versions > 6.0.0 although they have been [removed](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/removal-of-types.html). The console code has already been updated accordingly but notes (2) and (3) on the console code still name the `user` mapping type.

This PR updates the list with notes after the console code, as well as the first sentence of the docs
to avoid confusion. Also, I have removed the second command from the console code as it no
longer holds any value if the docs are solely on the `_doc` mapping.
