TEST: Avoid triggering merges in FlushIT

In testSyncedFlushSkipOutOfSyncReplicas, we reindex the extra documents
to all shards including the out-of-sync replica. However, reindexing to
that replica can trigger merges (due to the new deletes) which cause the
synced-flush failed. This test starts failing after we aggressively
trigger merges segments with a large number of deletes in LUCENE-8263.
