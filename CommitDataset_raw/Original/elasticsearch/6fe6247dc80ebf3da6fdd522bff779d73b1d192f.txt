Ignore script fields when size is 0 (#31917)

This change adds a check so that when parsing the search source, script fields are 
ignored when the requested search result size is 0. This helps with e.g. clients like 
Kibana that sends a list of script fields that they may need for convenience, but they
don't require any hits. Before this change, user sometimes ran into confusing behaviour, 
e.g. the script compilation limit to breaking although no hits were requested.

Closes #31824
