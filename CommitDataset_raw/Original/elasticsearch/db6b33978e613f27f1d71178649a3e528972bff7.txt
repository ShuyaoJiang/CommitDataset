Configurable password hashing algorithm/cost (#31234)

Make password hashing algorithm/cost configurable for the 
stored passwords of users for the realms that this applies
(native, reserved). Replaces predefined choice of bcrypt with
cost factor 10.
This also introduces PBKDF2 with configurable cost
(number of iterations) as an algorithm option for password hashing
both for storing passwords and for the user cache.
Password hash validation algorithm selection takes into
consideration the stored hash prefix and only a specific number
of algorithnm and cost factor options for brypt and pbkdf2 are 
whitelisted and can be selected in the relevant setting.
