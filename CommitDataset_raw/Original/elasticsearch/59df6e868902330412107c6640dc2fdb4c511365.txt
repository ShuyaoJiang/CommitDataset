Test: Lookup node versions on rest test start (#34657)

This is a forward port of a change made to clean up backwards
compatibility for the rollup cleanups. It makes the version of each node
available very early on in test execution. The 6.x version of the change
used those versions to control the cleanup backwards compatibility but
that isn't needed in this branch. But having the versions around *is*
useful. So this makes them available.

Closes #34629
