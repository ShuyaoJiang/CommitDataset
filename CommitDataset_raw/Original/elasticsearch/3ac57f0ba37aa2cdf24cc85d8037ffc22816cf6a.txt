Fix ordering of bootstrap checks in docs (#32417)

In the section of the bootstrap checks docs for the maximum map count
check, we refer to max size virtual memory check and explicitly call out
the maximum size virtual memory check as being the previous
point. However, this is not correct as the previous point is currently
the max file size check. It does make sense for these two checks to be
proximate to each other in the docs so this commit reorders the checks
so that the maximum size virtual memory check indeed comes before the
maximum map count check. This makes the sense in the maximum map count
check correct.
