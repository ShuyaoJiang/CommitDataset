Refactors ClientHelper to combine header logic (#30620)

* Refactors ClientHelper to combine header logic

This change removes all the `*ClientHelper` classes which were
repeating logic between plugins and instead adds
`ClientHelper.executeWithHeaders()` and
`ClientHelper.executeWithHeadersAsync()` methods to centralise the
logic for executing requests with stored security headers.

* Removes Watcher headers constant
