Disable dynamic mapping in testSimpleGetFieldMappingsWithDefaults (#38045)

Since #31140 we no longer require acking on the dynamic mapping of index
requests. Thus, a returned mapping from a get mapping request does not
necessarily contain the dynamic updates from the index request. This
commit replaces the dynamic mapping update with a manual put mapping.
