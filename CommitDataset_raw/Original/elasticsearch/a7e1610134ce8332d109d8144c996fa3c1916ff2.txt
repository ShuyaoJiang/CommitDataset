Add support for auto_generate_synonyms_phrase_query in match_query, multi_match_query, query_string and simple_query_string (#26097)

* Add support for auto_generate_synonyms_phrase_query in match_query, multi_match_query, query_string and simple_query_string

This change adds a new parameter called auto_generate_synonyms_phrase_query (defaults to true).
This option can be used in conjunction with synonym_graph token filter to generate phrase queries
when multi terms synonyms are encountered.
For example, a synonym like "ny, new york" would produce the following boolean query when "ny city" is parsed:
((ny OR "new york") AND city)

Note how the multi terms synonym "new york" produces a phrase query.
