X-Pack: Remove deprecated handlers, remove watcher restart action (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2133)

The deprecated handlers should have been removed earlier, but are now
going to to away finally.

Also the watcher restart action has been removed, mainly because users
should not blindly restart, but always make sure, that watcher is
stopped correctly before restarting. This had been removed from the
transport action previously.
