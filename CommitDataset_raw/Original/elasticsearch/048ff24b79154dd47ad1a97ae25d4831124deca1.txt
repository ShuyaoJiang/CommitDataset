[TEST] Wait for correct template version in rolling upgrade tests (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1682)

We wait for index templates to be installed before running tests, but
these can get upgraded when the master node is upgraded.  If we don't
wait again in this case then tests can fail due to the cleanup code
being overwhelmed by pending cluster state updates that weren't waited
for before the test.
