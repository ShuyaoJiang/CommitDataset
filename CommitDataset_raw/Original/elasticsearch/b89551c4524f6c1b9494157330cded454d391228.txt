[ML] Display integers without .0 in file structure field stats (#33947)

Previously numeric values in the field_stats created by the
find_file_structure endpoint were always output with a
decimal point.  This looked unfriendly and unnatural for
fields that clearly store integer values.  This change
converts integer values to type Integer before output in
the file structure field stats.
