Put mapping and index template requests do not need content type detection for 5.3.0+ (#24835)

This change cleans up some missed TODOs for content type detection on the source of put mapping and
put index template requests. In 5.3.0 and newer versions, the source is always JSON so the content
type detection is not needed. The TODOs were missed after the change was backported to 5.3.
