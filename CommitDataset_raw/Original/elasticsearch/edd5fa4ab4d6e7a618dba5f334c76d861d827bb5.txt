Watcher: Allow unmet action conditions to reset action status (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1859)

The logic of resetting acknowledgements is only executed, if the watch
wide condition is not met. However, if you dont specify a condition
(which makes it always true), but create a condition in your action
(this might make sense because it allows you to execute a transform and
then execute the condition), then after acking this action, it will
never get be unacked, because the watch wide condition is always met.
