Add option to force load term dict into memory (#39741)

Lucene added an optimization to leave the term dictionary on disk
for non-id like fields. This change happened very late in the release
processes such that it's better to have an escape hatch if certain
use-cases are hurt by this optimization. This setting might be
removed in the future if it turns out to be unnecessary.
