[CCR] Sync mappings between leader and follow index (#30115)

The shard changes api returns the minimum IndexMetadata version the leader
index needs to have. If the leader side is behind on IndexMetadata version
then follow shard task waits with processing write operations until the
mapping has been fetched from leader index and applied in follower index
in the background.

The cluster state api is used to fetch the leader mapping and put mapping api
to apply the mapping in the follower index. This works because put mapping
api accepts fields that are already defined.
