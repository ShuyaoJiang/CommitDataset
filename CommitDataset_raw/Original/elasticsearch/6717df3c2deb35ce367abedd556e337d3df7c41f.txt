[Test] Modify assert statement for ssl handshake (#32072)

There have been changes in error messages for `SSLHandshakeException`.
This has caused a couple of failures in our tests.
This commit modifies test verification to assert on exception type of
class `SSLHandshakeException`.
There was another issue in Java11 which caused NPE. The bug has now
been fixed on Java11 - early access build 22.
