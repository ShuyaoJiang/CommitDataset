Don't mark shard as refreshPending on stats fetching (#40458)

Completion and DocStats are pulled from internal readers
instead of external since #33835 and #33847 which doesn't require
us to refresh after a stats call since refreshes will happen internally
anyhow and that will cause updated stats on ongoing indexing.
