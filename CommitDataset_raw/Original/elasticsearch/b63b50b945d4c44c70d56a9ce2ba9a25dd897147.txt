Give precedence to index creation when mixing typed templates with typeless index creation and vice-versa. (#37871)

Currently if you mix typed templates and typeless index creation or typeless
templates and typed index creation then you will end up with an error because
Elasticsearch tries to create an index that has multiple types: `_doc` and
the explicit type name that you used.

This commit proposes to give precedence to the index creation call so that
the type from the template will be ignored if the index creation call is
typeless while the template is typed, and the type from the index creation
call will be used if there is a typeless template.

This is consistent with the fact that index creation already "wins" if a field
is defined differently in the index creation call and in a template: the
definition from the index creation call is used in such cases.

Closes #37773
