MapperService to wrap a single DocumentMapper. (#29511)

This refactors MapperService so that it wraps a single `DocumentMapper` rather
than a `Map<String, DocumentMapper>`. We will need follow-ups since I haven't
fixed most APIs that still expose collections of types of mappers, but this is
a start...
