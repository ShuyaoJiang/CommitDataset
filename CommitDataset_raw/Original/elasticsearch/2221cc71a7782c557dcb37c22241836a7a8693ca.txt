SQL: Fix getTime() methods in JDBC (#40484)

Previously, `getTime(colIdx/colLabel)` and
`getObject(colIdx/colLabel, java.sql.Time.class)` methods were computing
the time from a `ZonedDateTime` by applying day in millis modulo on the epoch millis
of the `ZonedDateTime` object. This is wrong as we need to keep the time
related fields at the timezone of the `ZonedDateTime` object and just
set the date info to the epoch date (01/01/1970).

Additionally fixes a testing issue as the original timezone id is converted
to an offset string when parsing the response from the server.
