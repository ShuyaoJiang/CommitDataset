Add a shallow copy method to aggregation builders (#28430)

This change adds a shallow copy method for aggregation builders. This method returns a copy of the builder replacing the factoriesBuilder and metaDada
This method is used when the builder is rewritten (AggregationBuilder#rewrite) in order to make sure that we create a new instance of the parent builder when sub aggregations are rewritten.
