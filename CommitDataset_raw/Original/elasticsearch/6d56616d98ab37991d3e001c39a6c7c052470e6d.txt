SQL: Ignore environment in CliFixture

If the currenct environment contains `JAVA_TOOLS` then the cli tests
will fail because they do not expect the notification about `JAVA_TOOLS`
that java prints to stdout. The clears the environment before starting
the CLI subprocess in an effort to remove the unexpected output.
