Watcher: Add support for actions in slack attachments (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3355)

In order to support buttons that can be clicked on within a slack
message, this commits adds support for so called actions within
attachments. This allows to create buttons, that are clicked and execute
a GET request, so actions must be idempotent according to the official
slack documentation.

Official slack documentation is available at
https://api.slack.com/docs/message-attachments#action_fields
