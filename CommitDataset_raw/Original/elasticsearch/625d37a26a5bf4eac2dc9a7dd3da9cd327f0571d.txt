Introduce retention lease background sync (#38262)

This commit introduces a background sync for retention leases. The idea
here is that we do a heavyweight sync when adding a new retention lease,
and then periodically we want to background sync any retention lease
renewals to the replicas. As long as the background sync interval is
significantly lower than the extended lifetime of a retention lease, it
is okay if from time to time a replica misses a sync (it will still have
an older version of the lease that is retaining more data as we assume
that renewals do not decrease the retaining sequence number). There are
two follow-ups that will come after this commit. The first is to address
the fact that we have not adapted the should periodically flush logic to
possibly flush the retention leases. We want to do something like flush
if we have not flushed in the last five minutes and there are renewed
retention leases since the last time that we flushed. An additional
follow-up will remove the syncing of retention leases when a retention
lease expires. Today this sync could be invoked in the background by a
merge operation. Rather, we will move the syncing of retention lease
expiration to be done under the background sync. The background sync
will use the heavyweight sync (write action) if a lease has expired, and
will use the lightweight background sync (replication action) otherwise.
