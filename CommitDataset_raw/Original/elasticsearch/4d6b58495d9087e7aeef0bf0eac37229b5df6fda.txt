SQL: Simplify expression ID generation (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3466)

Replaces the `ExpressionIdGenerator` class with a static method and drops
the `jvmId` field from the `ExpressionId` altogether because it isn't needed.

We still have the potential to roll over expression ids if the server lives for
a long time but it is quite unlikely and rolling over only matters if we roll
over in the same query. So long as each expression id is unique to a
particular query we're fine.
