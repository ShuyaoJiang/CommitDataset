Remove logging from elasticsearch-nio jar (#30761)

This is related to #27260. The elasticsearch-nio jar is supposed to be
a library opposed to a framework. Currently it internally logs certain
exceptions. This commit modifies it to not rely on logging. Instead
exception handlers are passed by the applications that use the jar.
