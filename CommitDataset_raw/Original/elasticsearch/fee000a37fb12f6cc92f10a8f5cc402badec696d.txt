[TEST] Redirect links to new locations (#30179)

We had a number of awaitsFix links that weren't updated after the xpack
merge.

Where possible I changed the links to the new locations, but in some
circumstances the original ticket was closed (suggesting the awaitsfix
should be removed) or was otherwise unclear the status.
