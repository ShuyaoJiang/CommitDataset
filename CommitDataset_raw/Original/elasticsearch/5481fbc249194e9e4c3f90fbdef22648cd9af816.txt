Handle missing values in painless (#30975)

* Handle missing values in painless

Throw an exception for `doc['field'].value`
if this document is missing a value for the `field`.

For 7.0:
This is the default behaviour from 7.0

For 6.x:
To enable this behavior from 6.x, a user can set a jvm.option:
 `-Des.script.exception_for_missing_value=true` on a node.
If a user does not enable this behavior, a deprecation warning is logged on start up.

Closes #29286
