HLRC: Forbid all Elasticsearch logging infra (#32784)

All of the Elasticsearch logging infrastructure relies on log4j but we
don't want the high level rest client to rely on log4j2. All of its
logging goes through commons-logging because our dependencies drag in
commons logging already. Anyway, this bans direct use of Elasticsearch's
logging infrastructure in the high level REST client. It is still
possible to use it indirectly though and there isn't anything we can
really do about that until we split the high level rest client from
Elasticsearch's server jar.
