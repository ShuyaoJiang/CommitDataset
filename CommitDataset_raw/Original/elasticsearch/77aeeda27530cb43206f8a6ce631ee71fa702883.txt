Correctly handle PKCS#11 tokens for system keystore (#33460)

* Correctly handle NONE keyword for system keystore

As defined in the PKCS#11 reference guide
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/p11guide.html
PKCS#11 tokens can be used as the JSSE keystore and truststore and
the way to indicate this is to set `javax.net.ssl.keyStore` and
`javax.net.ssl.trustStore` to `NONE` (case sensitive).

This commits ensures that we honor this convention and do not
attempt to load the keystore or truststore if the system property is
set to NONE.

* Handle password protected system truststore

When a PKCS#11 token is used as the system truststore, we need to
pass a password when loading it, even if only for reading
certificate entries. This commit ensures that if
`javax.net.ssl.trustStoreType` is set to `PKCS#11` (as it would
when a PKCS#11 token is in use) the password specified in
`javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword` is passed when attempting to
load the truststore.
