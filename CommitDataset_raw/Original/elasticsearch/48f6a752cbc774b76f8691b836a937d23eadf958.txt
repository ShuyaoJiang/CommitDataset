Watcher: Fix proxy scheme to default to HTTP (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3844)

This fixes a regression introduced in Elasticsearch 6.0, when switching
from HttpURLConnection to the Apache HTTP Client.

In the old implementation there was no way to specify if you wanted to use HTTP
or HTTPS for your proxy, only HTTP. If people needed to use HTTPs, they
could just use the CONNECT feature of the proxy.

The new implementation used the scheme of the request that was about to
be sent out as the proxy scheme to be used. So if the request was HTTPS
but the proxy server was HTTP this created a problem.

This commit changes the default scheme to be just HTTP, so that then the
standard CONNECT procecure is taken care off.

Without a real proxy server this is super hard to test. I have verified
this with the following test against a tinyproxy running on port 8888,
but I do not have a great idea how to test this in a unit testable way using a real proxy.
