TESTS: Stabilize Renegotiation Test (#33943)

* TESTS: Stabilize Renegotiation Test

* The second `startHandshake` is not synchronous and a read of only
50ms may fail to trigger it entirely (the failure can be reproduced reliably by setting the socket timeout to `1`)
=> fixed by retrying the read until the handshake finishes (a longer timeout would've worked too,
but retrying  seemed more stable)
* Closes #33772
