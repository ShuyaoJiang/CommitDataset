Fix NDCG for empty search results (#29267)

Fixes and edge case where DiscountedCumulativeGain can return NaN as
result of the quality metric calculation. This can happen when the
search result set is empty and normalization is used. We should return 0
in this case. Also adding related unit tests to the other two metrics.
