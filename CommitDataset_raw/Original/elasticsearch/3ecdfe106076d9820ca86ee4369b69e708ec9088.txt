Enable trace log in FollowerFailOverIT (#38148)

This suite still fails one per week sometimes with a worrying assertion.
Sadly we are still unable to find the actual source.

Expected: <SeqNoStats{maxSeqNo=229, localCheckpoint=86, globalCheckpoint=86}>
but: was   <SeqNoStats{maxSeqNo=229, localCheckpoint=-1, globalCheckpoint=86}>

This change enables trace log in the suite so we will have a better
picture if this fails again.
