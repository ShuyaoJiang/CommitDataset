TEST:  Retry synced-flush if ongoing ops on primary (#30978)

When the last indexing operation is completed, we will fire a global
checkpoint sync. Since a global checkpoint sync request is a replication
request, it will acquire an index shard permit on the primary when
executing. If this happens at the same time while we are issuing the
synced-flush, the synced-flush request will fail as it thinks there are
in-flight operations. We can avoid such situation by retrying another
synced-flush if the current request fails due to ongoing operations on
the primary.
