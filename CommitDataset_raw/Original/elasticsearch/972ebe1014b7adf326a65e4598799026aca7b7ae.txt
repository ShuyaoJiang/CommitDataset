More Verbose Assertion in testSnapshotWithStuckNode (#39893)

* The test failure in #39852 is caused by a file in the initial repository when there should not be any
  * It seems that on a normal consistent file system no left-over file should exist ever here after the validation finishes and I can't reproduce or see any other path to a dangling file in the fresh respository
=> added a more verbose and strict assertion that will log what file is left over next time
* Relates #39852
