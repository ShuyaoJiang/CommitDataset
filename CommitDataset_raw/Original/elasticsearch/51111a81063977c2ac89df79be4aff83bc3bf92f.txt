CCR: Stop FollowExistingIndexAction after report failure (#4111)

We check for the existence of both leader and follower index, then properly 
report to the caller. However, we do not return after reporting failure. This
causes the caller receive exception twice: IllegalArgumentException then
NullPointerException. This commit makes sure to stop the action after reporting
failure.
