[TEST] Use `ensureYellowAndNoInitializingShards` in monitoring test (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3768)

Monitoring creates indices concurrently to the test execution. In that
case ensureYellow might not be enough and will cause test-failures when shards
are not active etc. This change uses a new method added in core to ensure shards
are not initializing anymore.
