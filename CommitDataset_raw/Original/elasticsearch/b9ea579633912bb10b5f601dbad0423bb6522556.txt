Allow plugins to register pre-configured tokenizers (#24751)

Allows plugins to register pre-configured tokenizers. Much
of the decisions are the same as those in #24223, #24572,
and #24223. This only migrates the lowercase tokenizer but
I figure that is a good start because it proves out the features.
