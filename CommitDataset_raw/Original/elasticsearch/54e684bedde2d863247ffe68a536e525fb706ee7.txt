testHlrcFromXContent() should respect assertToXContentEquivalence() (#38232)

Tests can override assertToXContentEquivalence() in case their xcontent
cannot be directly compared (e.g. due to insertion order in maps
affecting the xcontent ordering).  But the `testHlrcFromXContent` test
hardcoded the equivalence test to `true` instead of consulting
`assertToXContentEquivalence()`

Fixes #36034
