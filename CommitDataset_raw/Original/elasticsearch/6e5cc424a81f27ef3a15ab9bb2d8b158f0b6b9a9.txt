Switch indices read-only if a node runs out of disk space (#25541)

Today when we run out of disk all kinds of crazy things can happen
and nodes are becoming hard to maintain once out of disk is hit.
While we try to move shards away if we hit watermarks this might not
be possible in many situations. Based on the discussion in #24299
this change monitors disk utilization and adds a flood-stage watermark
that causes all indices that are allocated on a node hitting the flood-stage
mark to be switched read-only (with the option to be deleted). This allows users to react on the low disk
situation while subsequent write requests will be rejected. Users can switch
individual indices read-write once the situation is sorted out. There is no
automatic read-write switch once the node has enough space. This requires
user interaction.

The flood-stage watermark is set to `95%` utilization by default.

Closes #24299
