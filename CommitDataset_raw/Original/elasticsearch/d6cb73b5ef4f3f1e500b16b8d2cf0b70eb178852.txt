Build: Pin the random seed at startup (#24990)

Pins the random testing seed at build start rather than letting
it vary with every randomized testing invocation. This is useful
for projects where random decisions in one randomized testing run
can effect the outcome of a second randomized testing run such as
the full cluster restart tests.

The goal isn't for tests to be able to assume that random decision
will be the same in both tests. It is more to make sure that the
seed printed when a test fails reproduces the appropriate random
decisions. And pinning the seed at startup should do just that.

This works by taking the key passed as a system property if one
is passed, otherwise picking a random long and getting it into
appropriate key format. The build just calls
`new Random().nextLong()` to get the seed while randomized testing
uses a Murmur3 hash of `System.nanoTime`.
