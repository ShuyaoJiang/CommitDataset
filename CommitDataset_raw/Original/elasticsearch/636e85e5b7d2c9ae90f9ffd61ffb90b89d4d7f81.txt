percolator: Hint what clauses are important in a conjunction query based on fields

The percolator field mapper doesn't need to extract all terms and ranges from a bool query with must or filter clauses.
In order to help to default extraction behavior, boost fields can be configured, so that fields that are known for not being
selective enough can be ignored in favor for other fields or clauses with specific fields can forcefully take precedence over other clauses.
This can help selecting clauses for fields that don't match with a lot of percolator queries over other clauses and thus improving performance of the percolate query.

For example a status like field is something that should configured as an ignore field.
Queries on this field tend to match with more documents and so if clauses for this fields
get selected as best clause then that isn't very helpful for the candidate query that the
percolate query generates to filter out percolator queries that are likely not going to match.
