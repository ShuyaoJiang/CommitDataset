[ML] Refactor job deletion logic into the transport action (#33891)

The job deletion logic was scattered around a few places:
the transport action, the job manager and the deletion task.
Overloading the task with deletion logic also meant extra
dependencies in the core package which should be unnecessary.

This commit consolidates all this logic into the transport action
and replaces the deletion task with a plain one that needs not be
aware of deletion logic.
