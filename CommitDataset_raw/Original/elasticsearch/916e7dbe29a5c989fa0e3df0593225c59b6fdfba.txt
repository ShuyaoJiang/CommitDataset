Add NioGroup for use in different transports (#27737)

This commit is related to #27260. It adds a base NioGroup for use in
different transports. This class creates and starts the underlying
selectors. Different protocols or transports are established by passing
the ChannelFactory to the bindServerChannel or openChannel
methods. This allows a TcpChannelFactory to be passed which will
create and register channels that support the elasticsearch tcp binary
protocol or a channel factory that will create http channels (or other).
