Log [initial_master_nodes] on formation failure (#36466)

Today we log a slightly cryptic "cluster bootstrapping is disabled on this
node" message if bootstrapping hasn't been configured. Since there is today
only one way to bootstrap the cluster it seems preferable to spell out exactly
which setting is missing.
