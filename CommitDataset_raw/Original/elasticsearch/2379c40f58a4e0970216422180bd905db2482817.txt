Add basic integration test for /_sql endpoint (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2109)

Similar to my work in elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2106, this adds a basic integration test for the rest sql action. We can add more as we go. Specifically, I'd like to add testing around handling of invalid SQL and a test for timezones, but neither work particularly well yet.
