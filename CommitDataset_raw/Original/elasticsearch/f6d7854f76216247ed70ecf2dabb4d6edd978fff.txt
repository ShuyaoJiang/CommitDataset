Remove indication of future multi-homing support (#32187)

We do not support intra-cluster connections on multiple interfaces, but the
documentation indicates that we will in future. In fact there is currently no
plan to support this, so the forward-looking documentation is misleading. This
commit

- removes the misleading sentence
- fixes that a transport profile affects outbound connections, not inbound ones
- tidies up some nearby text
