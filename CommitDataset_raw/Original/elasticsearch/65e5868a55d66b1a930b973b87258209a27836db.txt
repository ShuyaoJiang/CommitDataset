[test] add java packaging test project (#30161)

[test] add java packaging test project

Adds a project for building and running packaging tests written in java
for portability. The vagrant tasks use jars on the packagingTest
configuration, which are built in the same project. No tests are added
yet.

Corresponding changes are not made to :x-pack:qa:vagrant because the
java packaging tests will all be consolidated into one project.
