Log flush_stats and commit_stats in testMaybeFlush

This test failed a few times over the last several months. It seems that
we triggered a flush, but CI was too slow to finish it in several
seconds. I added the flush stats and commit stats and unmuted this test.
We should have a good clue if this test fails again.
