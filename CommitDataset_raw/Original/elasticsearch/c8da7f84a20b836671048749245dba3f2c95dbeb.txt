WrapperQueryBuilder should also rewrite the parsed query.

Failing to do so can cause other errors later on during query execution.
For example if  `WrapperQueryBuilder` wraps a `GeoShapeQueryBuilder` that fetches the shape from an index then it will skip the shape fetching
and fail later with the error that no shapes have been fetched.
