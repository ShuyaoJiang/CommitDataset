Ensure to generate identical NoOp for the same failure (#33141)

We generate slightly different NoOps in InternalEngine and
TransportShardBulkAction for the same failure.

1. InternalEngine uses Exception#getFailure to generate a message
without the class name: newOp [NoOp{seqNo=1, primaryTerm=1,
reason='Contexts are mandatory in context enabled completion field
[suggest_context]'}].

2. TransportShardBulkAction uses Exception#toString to generate a
message with the class name: NoOp{seqNo=1, primaryTerm=1,
reason='java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Contexts are mandatory in
context enabled completion field [suggest_context]'}.

If a write operation fails while a replica is recovering, that replica
will possibly receive two different NoOps: one from recovery and one
from replication. These two different NoOps will trip
TranslogWriter#assertNoSeqNumberConflict assertion.

This commit ensures that we generate the same Noop for the same failure.

Closes #32986
