Reenable LiveVersionMapTests.testRamBytesUsed on Java 9. (#29063)

I also had to make the test more lenient. This is due to the fact that
Lucene's RamUsageTester was changed in order not to reflect `java.*`
classes and the way that it estimates ram usage of maps is by assuming
it has similar memory usage to an `Object[]` array that stores all keys
and values. The implementation in `LiveVersionMap` tries to be slightly
more realistic by taking the load factor and linked lists into account,
so it usually gives a higher estimate which happens to be closer to
reality.
