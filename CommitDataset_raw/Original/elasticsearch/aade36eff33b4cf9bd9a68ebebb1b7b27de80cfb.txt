Fix failing CLI tests

This commit fixes some failing CLI tests. The failure here is that a
guard against the system property es.path.conf was added yet these tests
were not adapted for this change. This commit implements this adapation
which overrides the createEnv method where the problematic guard is
invoked. We do this to avoid having to set es.path.conf in tests.
