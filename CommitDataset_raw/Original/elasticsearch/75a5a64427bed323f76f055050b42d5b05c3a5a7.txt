Add test for HTTP and Transport TLS on basic license (#40714)

This adds a new security/qa test for TLS on a basic license.

It starts a 2 node cluster with a basic license, and TLS enabled
on both HTTP and Transport, and verifies the license type, x-pack
SSL usage and SSL certificates API.

It also upgrades the cluster to a trial license and performs that
same set of checks (to ensure that clusters with basic license
and TLS enabled can be upgraded to a higher feature license)
