[ML] Switch state to use _type "doc" (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1552)

This commit means that newly created ML state indices will have a single
type named "doc", and newly persisted state documents will have type
"doc" too.

Retrieving state is only supported for type "doc".

When deleting state, documents with the old types are deleted in addition
to those with type "doc".  This means jobs created by the beta can be fully
deleted.
