Fix ASN.1 encoding of "cn" OtherName in CertGen/CertUtil (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2858)

Certgen was generating "other name" SANs without the explicit [0] tag that is required.
This was masked by the fact that the JRE X.509 classes always wrap the "other name" name-value in a [0] tag  (even if it already has one)

Also switched to a UTF8 String from an IA5 string to match the configuration being used for testing in openssl.
