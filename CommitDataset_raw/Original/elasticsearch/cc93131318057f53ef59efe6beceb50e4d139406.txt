Forbid expensive query parts in ranking evaluation (#30151)

Currently the ranking evaluation API accepts the full query syntax for
the queries specified in the evaluation set and executes them via multi
search. This potentially runs costly aggregations and suggestions too.
This change adds checks that forbid using aggregations, suggesters, 
highlighters and the explain and profile options in the queries that are 
run as part of the ranking evaluation since they are irrelevent in the 
context of this API.
