Core: Parse floats in epoch millis parser (#34504)

In order to stay BWC compatible with joda time, the epoch millis date
formatter needs to parse dates with a dot like `123.45`. This
adds this functionality for the epoch millis parser in the same way as
for the epoch seconds parser. It also adds support for scientific
notations like `1.0e3` and fixes parsing of negative values for epoch
seconds and epoch millis.
