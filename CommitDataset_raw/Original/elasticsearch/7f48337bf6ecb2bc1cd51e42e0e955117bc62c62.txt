Watcher: Remove index template configuration via cluster settings (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1680)

Watcher had an undocumented feature to configure the settings of any
index template via updating the cluster settings. Instead of changing
the template one could add a setting during runtime that overwrote
what is written in the index template.

As index template are created once and not overwritten, users should
just change the index template - or the concrete index settings like
number of replicas.

This feature was not exposed in our documentation at all.
