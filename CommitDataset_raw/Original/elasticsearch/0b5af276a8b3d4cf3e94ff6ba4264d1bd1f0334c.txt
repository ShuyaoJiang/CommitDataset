Allow system privilege to execute proxied actions (#37508)

Currently all proxied actions are denied for the `SystemPrivilege`.
Unfortunately, there are use cases (CCR) where we would like to proxy
actions to a remote node that are normally performed by the
system context. This commit allows the system context to perform
proxy actions if they are actions that the system context is normally
allowed to execute.
