Circuit-break based on real memory usage

With this commit we introduce a new circuit-breaking strategy to the parent
circuit breaker. Contrary to the current implementation which only accounts for
memory reserved via child circuit breakers, the new strategy measures real heap
memory usage at the time of reservation. This allows us to be much more
aggressive with the circuit breaker limit so we bump it to 95% by default. The
new strategy is turned on by default and can be controlled  with the new cluster
setting `indices.breaker.total.userealmemory`.

Note that we turn it off for all integration tests with an internal test cluster
because it leads to spurious test failures which are of no value (we cannot
fully control heap memory usage in tests). All REST tests, however, will make
use of the real memory circuit breaker.
