Remove dead code for checking exclusive options

Previously we manually checked if mutually exclusive options are passed
on the command line. Yet, after an upgrade to our option parser
dependency, we were able to use built-in functionality to establish
these mutually exclusive options and the parser would take care of
checking if such options are passed on the command line. However, the
previous manually checking code is now dead and was left behind. This
commit removes that dead code.

Relates #19278
