SetupPasswordTool handle url cmd option correctly (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2899)

Fixes bug when the url option had trailing slashes. The URL built
was invalid (consecutive fwd slashes) but the failure errors of
the subsequent requests were ignored.

URL is built correctly from the option spec.
True HTTP errors and Exceptions are logged and the cmd fails.
