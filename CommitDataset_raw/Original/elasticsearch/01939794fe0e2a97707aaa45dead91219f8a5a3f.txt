Introduce Maintenance Mode to ILM (#31164)

This PR introduces a concept of a maintenance mode for the
lifecycle service. During maintenance mode, no policies are
executed.

To be placed into maintenance mode, users must first issue a
request to be placed in maintenance mode. Once the service
is assured that no policies are in actions that are not to be
interrupted (like ShrinkAction), the service will place itself
in maintenance mode.

APIs to-be introduced:

- POST _xpack/index_lifecycle/maintenance/_request
   - issues a request to be placed into maintenenance mode.
     This is not immediate, since we must first verify that
     it is safe to go from REQUESTED -> IN maintenance mode.
- POST _xpack/index_lifecycle/maintenance/_stop
   - issues a request to be taken out (this is immediate)
- GET _xpack/index_lifecycle/maintenance
   - get back the current mode our lifecycle management is in
