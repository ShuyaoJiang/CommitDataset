SQL: Re-enable matrix aggregations (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3977)

Remove functions without a backing matrix agg

MatrixAgg works across multiple fields and exposing it directly in SQL
does not work. Instead isolated functions are exposed which get folded
and optimized into one matrix agg per field. Thus not all matrix 
functions can be exposed in SQL, at least at this time.

Instead of depending on the plugin directly, depend on the plugin client
jar (matrix-agg-client)

Remove outdated test
