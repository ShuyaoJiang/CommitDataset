Add ability to automatically adjust search threadpool queue_size

This PR adds a new thread pool type: `fixed_auto_queue_size`. This thread pool
behaves like a regular `fixed` threadpool, except that every
`auto_queue_frame_size` operations (default: 10,000) in the thread pool,
[Little's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little's_law) is calculated and
used to adjust the pool's `queue_size` either up or down by 50. A minimum and
maximum is taken into account also. When the min and max are the same value, a
regular fixed executor is used instead.

The `SEARCH` threadpool is changed to use this new type of thread pool. However,
the min and max are both set to 1000, meaning auto adjustment is opt-in rather
than opt-out.

Resolves #3890
