Add SSL Configuration Library (#37287)

This introduces a new ssl-config library that can parse
and validate SSL/TLS settings and files.

It supports the standard configuration settings as used in the
Elastic Stack such as "ssl.verification_mode" and
"ssl.certificate_authorities" as well as all file formats used
in other parts of Elasticsearch security (such as PEM, JKS,
PKCS#12, PKCS#8, et al).
