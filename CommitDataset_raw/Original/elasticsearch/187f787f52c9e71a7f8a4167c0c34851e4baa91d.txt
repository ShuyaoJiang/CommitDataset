[Zen2] Introduce LeaderChecker (#33024)

It is important that follower nodes periodically check that their leader is
still healthy and that they remain part of its cluster. If these checks fail
repeatedly then followers should attempt to find and join a new leader,
possibly electing one in the process. The LeaderChecker, introduced in this
commit, performs these periodic checks and deals with retries.
