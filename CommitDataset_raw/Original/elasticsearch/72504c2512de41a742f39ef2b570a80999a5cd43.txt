Do not recommend to use the _id field in search_after docs (#35370)

The documentation of `search_after` recommends to use the `_id`
field as a tiebreaker for the sort without warning against
the additional memory required. This change changes the recommandation
to use a copy of the `_id` field with doc_values enabled.
