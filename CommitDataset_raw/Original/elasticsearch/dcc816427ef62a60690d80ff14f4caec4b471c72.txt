Expose whether or not the global checkpoint updated (#32659)

It will be useful for future efforts to know if the global checkpoint
was updated. To this end, we need to expose whether or not the global
checkpoint was updated when the state of the replication tracker
updates. For this, we add to the tracker a callback that is invoked
whenever the global checkpoint is updated. For primaries this will be
invoked when the computed global checkpoint is updated based on state
changes to the tracker. For replicas this will be invoked when the local
knowledge of the global checkpoint is advanced from the primary.
