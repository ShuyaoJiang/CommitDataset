Build: Allow deps to be a direct jar (#28096)

Currently the code which disable transitive dependencies assumes all
deps are a "module dependency" in gradle. But a jar file dep is not.
This commit relaxes the closure signature to allow any dependency and
only enforce the transitive disabling for module dependencies.
