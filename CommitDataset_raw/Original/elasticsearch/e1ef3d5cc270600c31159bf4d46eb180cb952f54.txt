Add debug logging for refresh REST tests

We are chasing a test failure in the "refresh=wait_for waits until
changes are visible in search" test yet the logs currently give us no
indication what is happening. This commit adds debug logging for this
test, and cleans up this logging in a teardown section. We can remove
this additional logging after we chase the test failure down.
