[CCR] Added history uuid validation (#33546)

For correctness we need to verify whether the history uuid of the leader
index shards never changes while that index is being followed.

* The history UUIDs are recorded as custom index metadata in the follow index.
* The follow api validates whether the current history UUIDs of the leader
  index shards are the same as the recorded history UUIDs.
  If not the follow api fails.
* While a follow index is following a leader index; shard follow tasks
  on each shard changes api call verify whether their current history uuid
  is the same as the recorded history uuid.

Relates to #30086
