LDAP calls that create a new connection use privilegedConnect (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2018)

This change fixes some cases where calls to the LDAP library can result in a new connection being
created that were not wrapped in privileged connect calls. This would result in permission denied
errors when trying to make the connection.
