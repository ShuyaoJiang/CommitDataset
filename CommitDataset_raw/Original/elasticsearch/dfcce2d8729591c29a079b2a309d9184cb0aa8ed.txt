Speed up some of our slowest unit tests. (#29414)

`BaseRandomBinaryDocValuesRangeQueryTestCase.testRandomBig` should only run with
nightly tests. It doesn't make sense to make it part of every test run.

`UUIDTests` had a slow test for compression, which I made a bit faster by
decreasing the number of indexed docs.
