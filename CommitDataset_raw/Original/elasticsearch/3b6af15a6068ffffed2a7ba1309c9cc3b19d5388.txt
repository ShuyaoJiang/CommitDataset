XContent: Factor deprecation handling into callback (#28449)

Factors the way in which XContent parsing handles deprecated fields
into a callback that is set at parser construction time. The goals here
are:
1. Remove Log4J as a dependency of XContent so that XContent can be used
by clients without forcing log4j and our particular deprecation handling
scheme.
2. Simplify handling of deprecated fields in tests. Now tests can listen
directly for the deprecation callback rather than digging through a
ThreadLocal.

More accurately, this change begins this work. It deprecates a number of
methods, pointing folks to the new versions of those methods that take
`DeprecationHandler`. The plan is to slowly drop these deprecated
methods. Once they are entirely removed we can remove Log4j as
dependency of XContent.
