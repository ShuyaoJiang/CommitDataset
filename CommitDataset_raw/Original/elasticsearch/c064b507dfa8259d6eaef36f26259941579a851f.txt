Encapsulate Translog in Engine (#31220)

This removes the abstract `getTranslog` method in `Engine`, instead leaving it
to the abstract implementations of the other methods that use the translog. This
allows future Engines not to have a Translog, as instead they must implement the
methods that use the translog pieces to return necessary values.
