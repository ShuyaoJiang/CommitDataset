Never corrupt fully deleted segments in tests (#36741)

Today we might corrupt a fully deleted segment which is then pruned
once a snapshot is taken. This causes random test failures in CorruptedFileIT.
This change hardens the selection of files to corrupt and removes some fragile
code preventing fully deleted segments to be taken into account.

Closes #36526
