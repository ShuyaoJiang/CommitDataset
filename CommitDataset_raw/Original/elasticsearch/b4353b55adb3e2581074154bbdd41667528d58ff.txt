Allow build to directly run under JDK 9 (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2320)

With Gradle 4.1 and newer JDK versions, we can finally invoke Gradle directly using a JDK9 JAVA_HOME without requiring a JDK8 to "bootstrap" the build. As the thirdPartyAudit task runs within the JVM that Gradle runs in, it needs to be adapted now to be JDK9 aware.

Relates to elastic/elasticsearch#25859
