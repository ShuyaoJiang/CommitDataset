Deprecate types in get field mapping API (#37667)

- Add deprecation warning to RestGetFieldMappingAction
- Add two new java HRLC classes GetFieldMappingsRequest and
GetFieldMappingsResponse. These classes use new typeless forms
of a request and response, and differ in that from the server
versions.

Relates to #35190
