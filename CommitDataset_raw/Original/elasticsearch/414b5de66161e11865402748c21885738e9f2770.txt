TEST: Lower num of shards in testShrinkIndexPrimaryTerm

In some cases testShrinkIndexPrimaryTerm creates then 'mutates' 210
shards. If each shard opens more than 10 files (translog, lucene index),
we exceeded the maximum allowed file handles. In our test, the number of
file handles is limited to 2048 by HandleLimitFS. This commit reduces
the number of shards in testShrinkIndexPrimaryTerm to avoid such errors.

Closes #28153
