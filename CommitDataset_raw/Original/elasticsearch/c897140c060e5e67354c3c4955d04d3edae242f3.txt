Add cause to assert_no_failure when replay translog (#39333)

We tripped this assertion three times for the last two weeks. However,
it only says "this IndexWriter is closed" without the actual cause.

```
[2019-02-14T11:46:31,144][ERROR][o.e.b.ElasticsearchUncaughtExceptionHandler] [node-1] fatal error in thread [elasticsearch[node-1][generic][T#2]], exiting

java.lang.AssertionError: unexpected failure while replicating translog entry: org.apache.lucene.store.AlreadyClosedException: this IndexWriter is closed
```

This change replaces an assert with an AssertionError so that we will
have the actual cause in the next build failures.
