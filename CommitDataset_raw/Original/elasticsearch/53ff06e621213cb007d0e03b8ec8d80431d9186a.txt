Upgrade to Lucene-7.5.0-snapshot-608f0277b0 (#32390)

The main highlight is the removal of the reclaim_deletes_weight in the TieredMergePolicy.
The es setting index.merge.policy.reclaim_deletes_weight is deprecated in this commit and the value is ignored. The new merge policy setting setDeletesPctAllowed should be added in a follow up.
