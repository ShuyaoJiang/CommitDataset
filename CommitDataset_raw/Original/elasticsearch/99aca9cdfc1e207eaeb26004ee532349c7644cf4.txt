Enhances exists queries to reduce need for `_field_names` (#26930)

* Enhances exists queries to reduce need for `_field_names`

Before this change we wrote the name all the fields in a document to a `_field_names` field and then implemented exists queries as a term query on this field. The problem with this approach is that it bloats the index and also affects indexing performance.

This change adds a new method `existsQuery()` to `MappedFieldType` which is implemented by each sub-class. For most field types if doc values are available a `DocValuesFieldExistsQuery` is used, falling back to using `_field_names` if doc values are disabled. Note that only fields where no doc values are available are written to `_field_names`.
