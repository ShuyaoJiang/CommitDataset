[ML] Correctly ignore extra aggregation buckets (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#2530)

The problem here is that the code was ignoring buckets
whose start time was before the start time of the extractor.
However, this is not a good enough condition. For example,
when there are no data in the bucket extra bucket that is
being queried, the first bucket will be the one containing
the start time.

This commit fixes the issue by changing the condition to
ignore buckets before the first bucket that includes the
start time of the extraction.
