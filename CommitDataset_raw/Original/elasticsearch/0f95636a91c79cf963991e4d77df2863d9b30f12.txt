Build: Remove rest tests on archive distribution projects (#28952)

This commit removes running rest tests on the full zip and tar
distributions in favor of doing a simple extraction check like is done
for rpm and deb files. The rest tests are still run on the integ test
zip, at least for now (this should eventually be moved out to a different
location).
