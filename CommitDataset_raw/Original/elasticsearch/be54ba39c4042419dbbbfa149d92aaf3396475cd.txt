Add expected mapping type to `MapperException` (#31564)

Currently if a document cannot be indexed because it violates the defined 
mapping for the index, a MapperException is thrown. In some cases it is 
useful to expose the expected field type in the exception itself, 
so that the user can react based on the error message. This change adds 
the expected data type to the MapperException.

Closes #31502
