Merge branch 'master' into 'zen2'

Conflicts during the merge:
1. >=140 chars line length fixed for a lot of project files and warnings
for those files are no longer suppressed
2. Node name is removed from AbstractComponent, itâ€™s no longer taken
from settings, but is explicitly passed as constructor argument and
there were quite a few new classes on zen2 branch that require this
change
3. TransportResponseHandler interface changed (new method added) and
Zen2 makes a lot of subclasses in tests
4. Deprecated way of obtaining logger was changed
