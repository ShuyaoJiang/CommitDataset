Add rollover-creation-date setting to rolled over index (#31144)

This commit introduces a new property to IndexMetaData called
RolloverInfo. This object contains a map containing the aliases
that were used to rollover the related index, which conditions
were met, and at what time the rollover took place.

much like the `index.creation_date`, it captures the approximate time
that the index was rolled over to a new one.
