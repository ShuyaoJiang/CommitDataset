Fix RareClusterStateIT on MacOS (#40203)

Today RareClusterStateIT#testAssignmentWithJustAddedNodes fails on my Mac
because it waits for the default connection timeout of 30 seconds to connect to
a fake node with IP address 0.0.0.0. This connection attempt fails much more
quickly on Linux so the test passes.

This commit fixes this by reducing the connection timeout for this test.
