Adds support for persistent actions

A persistent action is a transport-like action that is using the cluster state instead of transport to start tasks. This allows persistent tasks to survive restart of executing nodes. A persistent action can be implemented by extending TransportPersistentAction. TransportPersistentAction will start the task by using PersistentActionService, which controls persistent tasks lifecycle.  See TestPersistentActionPlugin for an example implementing a persistent action.
