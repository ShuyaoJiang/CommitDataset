Clarify using time_zone and date math in range query (#40655)

Currently, the docs correctly state that using `now` in range queries will not
be affected by the `time_zone` parameter. However, using date math roundings
like e.g. `now\d` will be affected by the `time_zone`. Adding this example
because it seems to be a frequently asked question and source of confusion.
