[Security] Include doc-type in _id for tokens (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1473)

In preparation for the removal of types, new security types like invalidated-tokens are stored in the .security
index under the generic "doc" type, with a query filter on `doc_type`.

In order to avoid id clashes, we also need to use that doc_type as part of the document id.
