REST high-level client: fix _cluster/settings endpoint

The recent addition of the _cluster/settings API was merged together with another change that added encoding of the different URL parts. That broke the cluster PUT settings API straight-away. This commit fixes this problem. The '/' that's part of the /_cluster/settings endpoint should not be encoded.
