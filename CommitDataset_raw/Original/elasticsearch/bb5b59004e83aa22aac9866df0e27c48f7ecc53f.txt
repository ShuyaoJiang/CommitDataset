[TEST] Manually trigger resource watching (#34893)

SSLTrustRestrictionsTests.testRestrictionsAreReloaded checks that the
SSL trust configuration is automatically updated reapplied if the
underlying "trust_restrictions.yml" file is modified.

Since the default resource watcher frequency is 5seconds, it could
take 10 second to run that test (as it waits for 2 reloaded).

Previously this test set that frequency to a very low value (3ms) so
that the elapsed time for the test would be reduced. However this
caused other problems, including that the resource watcher would
frequently run while the cluster was shutting down and files were
being cleaned up.

This change resets that watch frequency back to its default (5s) and
then manually calls the "notifyNow" method on the resource watcher
whenever the restrictions file is modified, so that the SSL trust
configuration is reloaded at exactly the right time.
