Remove deprecated `useDisMax` from MultiMatchQuery (#36488)

The getters and setters for useDisMax() have been deprecated since at least 6.0,
also there hasn't been any reference to the query parameter in the
documentation. Removing it from the builder and tests and replacing it with
`tieBreaker(1.0f)` where necessary.
