Docs: Skip xpack snippet tests if no xpack (#31619)

Skips tests the require xpack if we run the doc build without xpack. So
this should work:
```
./gradlew -p docs check -Dtests.distribution=oss-zip
```

This is implemented by detecting parts of the doc that look like:
```
[testenv="basic"]
```

Relates to #30665
