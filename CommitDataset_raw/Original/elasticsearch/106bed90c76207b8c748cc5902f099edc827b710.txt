Add `coordinating_only` node selector (#30313)

Today we can execute cluster API actions on only master, data or ingest nodes
using the `master:true`, `data:true` and `ingest:true` filters, but it is not
so easy to select coordinating-only nodes (i.e. those nodes that are neither
master nor data nor ingest nodes). This change fixes this by adding support for
a `coordinating_only` filter such that `coordinating_only:true` adds all
coordinating-only nodes to the set of selected nodes, and 
`coordinating_only:false` deletes them.

Resolves #28831.
