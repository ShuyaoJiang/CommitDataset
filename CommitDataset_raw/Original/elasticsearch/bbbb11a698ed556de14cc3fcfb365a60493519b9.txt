Painless: Fix Bindings Bug (#33274)

When the change was made to the format for in the whitelist for bindings, parameters from
both the constructor and the method were combined into a single list instead of separate 
lists. The check for method parameters was being executed from the start of the combined 
list rather than the correct position. The tests for bindings used a constructor and a method 
that only used the int types so this was not caught. The test has been changed to also use 
a double type and this issue is fixed.
