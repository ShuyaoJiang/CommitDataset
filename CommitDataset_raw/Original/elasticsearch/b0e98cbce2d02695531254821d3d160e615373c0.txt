Pass the host name on as `server_name` if proxy mode is on (#34559)

In remote cluster setup if we see a configured proxy we should set
the seed nodes host name as the `server_name` to trigger SNI based
routing even for seed nodes. Since remote cluster connections are
plain TCP connections we have to set the host manually since the other
side can't take it from the request URL like in the HTTP case.
This also adds some more informative logging to remote cluster connection.
