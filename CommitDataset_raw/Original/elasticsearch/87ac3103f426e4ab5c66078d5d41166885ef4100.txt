Do not mutate RecoveryResponse (#37204)

Today we create a global instance of RecoveryResponse then mutate it
when executing each recovery step. This is okay for the current
sequential recovery flow but  not suitable for an asynchronous recovery
which we are targeting. With this commit, we return the result of each
step separately, then construct a RecoveryResponse at the end.
