Use ByteBuffer#slice in BytesReference wrapper (#36862)

Currently the ByteBufferReference does not duplicate the buffer.
This means that any changes to the buffer's limit or position will
impact the reference. This can lead to unexpected behavior. This commit
uses the ByteBuffer#slice method to ensure that the reference retains
its own ByteBuffer.
