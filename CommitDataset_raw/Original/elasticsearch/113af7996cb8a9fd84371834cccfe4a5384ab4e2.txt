Make limit on number of expanded fields configurable (#35284)

Currently we introduced a hard limit of 1024 to the number of fields a query can
be expanded to in #26541. Instead of using a hard limit, we should make this
configurable. This change removes the hard limit check and uses the existing
`max_clause_count` setting instead.

Closes #34778
