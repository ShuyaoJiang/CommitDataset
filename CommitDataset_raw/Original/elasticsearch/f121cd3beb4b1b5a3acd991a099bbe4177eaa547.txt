Fix pre-6.0 response to unknown replication actions

When sending replica requests for replication operations, we skip
sending the request to pre-6.0 nodes for operations that such nodes
would not be aware of (e.g., the background global checkpoint sync, or
the primary/replica resync) since they would not know what to do with
these requests. Yet, we simulate that we received responses from these
nodes. Today, this is done by simulating that they sent us that their
local checkpoint is unassigned sequence number. However, for pre-6.0
nodes we have introduced a special local checkpoint used in the global
checkpoint tracker for such nodes and that is what we should use here
too. This commit fixes this issue.
