[ML] Map new fields as keywords in results index (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#1387)

Each job introduces new fields to the results index matching
the analysis terms. When the job is created, mappings for those
are added explicitly. However, when rollover is introduced, that
will not be the case. This commit prepares for that by adding
dynamic mapping of new fields as keyword.
