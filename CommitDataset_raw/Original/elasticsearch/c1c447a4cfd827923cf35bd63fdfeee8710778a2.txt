Check stemmer language setting early (#34601)

Currently the StemmerTokenFilterFactory checks the validity of the language
setting only when the first TokenStream is processed. Instead we should throw an
error earlier at mapping creation time. This change adds a check to the
StemmerTokenFilterFactory constructor that checks for a valid `language` setting
by trying to create a new TokenStream from an empty input stream. This will
throw errors about wrong language settings early on.

Closes #34170
