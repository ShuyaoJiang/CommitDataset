Enhancements to IndicesQueryCache. (#39099)

This commit adds the following:
 - more tests to IndicesServiceCloseTests, one of them found a bug in the order
   in which `IndicesQueryCache#onClose` and
   `IndicesService.indicesRefCount#decRef` are called.
 - made `IndicesQueryCache.stats2` a synchronized map. All writes to it are
   already protected by the lock of the Lucene cache, but the final read from
   an assertion in `IndicesQueryCache#close()` was not so this change should
   avoid any potential visibility issues.
 - human-readable `toString`s to make debugging easier.
