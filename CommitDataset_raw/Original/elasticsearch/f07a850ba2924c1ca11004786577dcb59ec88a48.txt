[SAML] add security permission to get the classloader (elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3720)

This adds the security permission to get the thread context classloader to the security
plugin after it was inadvertently removed in elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3651. This was not caught as there is a
dependency on monitoring for security and monitoring has the getClassLoader permission.

relates elastic/x-pack-elasticsearch#3719
