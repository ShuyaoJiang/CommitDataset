DISCOVERY: Use Realistic Num. of Min Master Nodes (#34854)

* DISCOVERY: Use Realistic Num. of Min Master Nodes

* With all 3 nodes starting in parallel 2 nodes can win a master election and
start waiting for nodes to join when started in parallel. We wait for 30s on the
rest tests for the cluster health endpoint to show 3 nodes which breaks if
one of the master nodes itself waits for 30s for joining nodes, waiting for 5 seconds
fixes the issue and allows us to run with `minimum master nodes < node count`
* relates #33675
