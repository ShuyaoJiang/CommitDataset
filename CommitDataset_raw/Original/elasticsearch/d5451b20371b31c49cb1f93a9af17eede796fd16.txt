Die with dignity while merging

If an out of memory error is thrown while merging, today we quietly
rewrap it into a merge exception and the out of memory error is
lost. Instead, we need to rethrow out of memory errors, and in fact any
fatal error here, and let those go uncaught so that the node is torn
down. This commit causes this to be the case.
