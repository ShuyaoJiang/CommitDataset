Add implicit this for class binding in Painless (#40285)

This change allows class bindings to add as their first argument, the base script 
class. The this reference to the base script class will be implicitly passed into a 
class binding as the first constructor argument upon initialization when 
specified as the first argument in whitelist entry for the class binding. This 
allows a class binding access to additional information added to the base script 
class such as more information about the current document or current shard. 
One extra requirement for this to work is the appropriate script base class 
must be whitelisted (should be empty).
