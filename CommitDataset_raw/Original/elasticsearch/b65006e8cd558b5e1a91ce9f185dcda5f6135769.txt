[ML] Fix ML memory tracker for old jobs (#37311)

Jobs created in version 6.1 or earlier can have a
null model_memory_limit.  If these are parsed from
cluster state following a full cluster restart then
we replace the null with 4096mb to make the meaning
explicit.  But if such jobs are streamed from an
old node in a mixed version cluster this does not
happen.  Therefore we need to account for the
possibility of a null model_memory_limit in the ML
memory tracker.
