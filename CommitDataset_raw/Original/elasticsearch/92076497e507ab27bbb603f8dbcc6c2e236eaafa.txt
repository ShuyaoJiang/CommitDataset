Use a dedicated ConnectionManger for RemoteClusterConnection (#32988)


This change introduces a dedicated ConnectionManager for every RemoteClusterConnection
such that there is not state shared with the TransportService internal ConnectionManager.
All connections to a remote cluster are isolated from the TransportService but still uses
the TransportService and it's internal properties like the Transport, tracing and internal
listener actions on disconnects etc.
This allows a remote cluster connection to have a different lifecycle than a local cluster connection,
also local discovery code doesn't get notified if there is a disconnect on from a remote cluster and
each connection can use it's own dedicated connection profile which allows to have a reduced set of
connections per cluster without conflicting with the local cluster.

Closes #31835
