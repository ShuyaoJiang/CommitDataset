[ingest] geo-ip performance improvements (#33029)

Re-implement the cache to avoid jackson JSON de-serialization for
every IP lookup. The built in maxmind cache caches JsonNode objects.
This requires de-serialization for every lookup, even if the object
is found in cache. Profiling shows that is very expensive (CPU).

The cache will now consist of the fully de-serialized objects.
Profiling shows that the new footprint for the CityDB is ~6KB per cache
entry. This may result in ~6MB increase with the 1000 entry default.
The  performance has been measured up to 40% faster on a modern 4 core/8 thread
CPU for an ingest (minimal indexing) workflow.

Further, the since prior implementation cached the JsonNode objects,
and there is not a 1:1 relationship between an IP lookup / JsonNode
object, the default cache size was most likely too small to be very
effective. While this change does not change the 1000 default cache
size, it will now cache more since there is now a 1:1 relationship between
an IP lookup and value in the cache.
