Remove `Tracer` from `MockTransportService` (#40237)

Currently we have a piece of infrastructure that allows tests to add
tracers to the MockTransportService. However, this functionality can
be implemented using the underlying transport message listener. This
commit removes the tracer. Additionally it modifies the tracer logger
tests to actually test the log messages.
