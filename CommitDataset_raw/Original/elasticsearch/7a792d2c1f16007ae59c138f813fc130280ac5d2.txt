Timed runnable should delegate to abstract runnable

If timed runnable wraps an abstract runnable, then it should delegate to
the abstract runnable otherwise force execution and handling rejections
is dropped on the floor. Thus, timed runnable should itself be an
abstract runnable delegating all methods to the wrapped runnable in
cases when it is an abstract runnable. This commit causes this to be the
case.
