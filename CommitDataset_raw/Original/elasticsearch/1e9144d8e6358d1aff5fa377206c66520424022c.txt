Switch remaining x-pack tests to new style Requests (#33108)

In #29623 we added `Request` object flavored requests to the low level
REST client and in #30315 we deprecated the old `performRequest`s. This
changes all calls in the `x-pack/qa/saml-idp-tests` and
`x-pack/qa/security-setup-password-tests` projects to use the new
versions.
