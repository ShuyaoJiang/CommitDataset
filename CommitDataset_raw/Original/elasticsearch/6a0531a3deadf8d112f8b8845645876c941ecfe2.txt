Fix intermittent failure in ApiKeyIntegTests (#38627)

Few tests failed intermittently and most of the
times due to invalidated or expired keys that were
deleted were still reported in search results.
This commit removes the test and adds enhancements
to other tests testing different scenario's.

When ExpiredApiKeysRemover is triggered, the tests
did not await its termination thereby sometimes
the results would be wrong for a search operation.

DELETE_INTERVAL setting has been further reduced to
100ms so we can trigger ExpiredApiKeysRemover faster.

Closes #38408
