Change the implementation of Futures.combine to be faster!

Also, replace all uses of sameThreadExecutor with a cheaper implementation. (IMHO, this should be _the_ implementation of sameThreadExecutor with a new sameThreadExecutorService for those who want it, but since that wouldn't be backwards compatible.... sadness)
