Next batch of pent-up fixes.

Visible changes:
- Add ImmutableSortedSet.copyOf(Collection) which is safe for concurrent
  modification.
- Make ImmutableSet.copyOf(Collection) public.
- Various Futures javadoc improvements (also use <V> and <X> over <T> and <E>).
- Revamp javadoc for Function, Predicate and related classes. Highlight the
  issue about consistency with equals, as this problem has been noticed with
  utilities like Sets.filter() (issue 363).

Less-visible changes:
- Add a few missing @Nullable annoations.
- In Iterables.concat impl, create an Iterator<Iterator> directly rather than via transform().
