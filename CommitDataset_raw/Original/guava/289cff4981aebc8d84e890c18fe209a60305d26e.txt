Attempt to fix bugs where objects that are incompatible with eachother are tested for equality (generally: Lists and Sets, or Classes of incompatible types).

In order to facilitate enhancements to an existing compile-time error check ([] it's necessary to fix existing issues before updating the static analysis.

If I've gotten the fix incorrect, please let me know here, or, if you'd prefer, I can add a suppression on the existing buggy code for you or your team to pick up later.
