Add some functionality to SerializingExecutor and rework its code.

Add functionality to suspend the execution. Intended primarily for cases where we want to wait
for an rpc before continuing execution.

Add functionality to prepend a task to the queue, intended primarily for cases where
a continuation of the current task is needed to run immediately afterwards. This
may happen if we need to send an rpc and suspend the queue before retrying the current task.

Use case: [] there named ExecutionQueue
