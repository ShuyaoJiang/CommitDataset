Make Graphs.oppositeNode() slightly more efficient. It performs the same number of equals checks (1 in self-loop case, 2 otherwise) but without the additional call to contains() - while still providing the incidence check.

Also, make it work on the base Graph type. This will be necessary in order to call it from our base abstract graph implementation.

And finally, add test coverage, for which there was apparently none!
