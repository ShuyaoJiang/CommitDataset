Assorted cleanup of cancellation:
- Eliminate our overrides of interruptTask() (other than one in a test of interruptTask()).
- Make cancel() final under GWT.
- Simplify a few tests.
- Add or improve boilerplate comments about visibility of fields.

We will likely not be able to make cancel() final in general (even if it weren't for our backward-compatiblity guarantees), thanks to certain usages.
I had hoped that maybe we could in FluentFuture. I suppose that we still could, since we'll offer FluentFuture.from(ListenableFuture), and anyone who needs to override cancel() could override it in the delegate.
