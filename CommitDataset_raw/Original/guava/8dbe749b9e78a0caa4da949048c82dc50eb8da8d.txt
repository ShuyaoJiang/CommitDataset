Properly handle input cancellations in Futures.catching[Async]

Currently, if input future is cancelled and the fallback handler does not handle CancellationException, the output future will end up as failed with CancellationException. Instead, the more logical result should be that output future ends up as cancelled as well.

RELNOTES=`concurrent`: When the input to `Futures.catching*` is cancelled, cancel the output, rather than failing the output with a `CancellationException` (unless the exception is caught).
