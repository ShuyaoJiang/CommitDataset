Miscellaneous cleanups:
- Remove unused ImmutableSortedMultiset.Builder.comparator.
- Change @link to @linkplain where appropriate, and fix a couple busted @link tags seen along the way (based on a search for '{@link\b[^}]*([ *]+[^ *}]*[^ *}]*[^ *},]){3}'). (Change one @link in ServiceManager to @code.) In a couple cases (TimeUtil, ServiceModule), the text ought to be *partially* code font, but I haven't taken further action
- Strip Converter.from implementation from Guava, since Converter.from itself is stripped.
- Run trivial RunnablesTest under GWT.
- Remove a few instances of "$inheritDoc," which should have been "@inheritDoc" and wasn't necessary anyway.
- Remove per-method @GwtIncompatible annotations from SmallCharMatcher, which is entirely @GwtIncompatible.
- Remove stray blank line in AbstractMapBasedMultimap.
- Insert missing space in UninterruptiblesTest failure message.
- Remove extra space in WrappingExecutorService.wrapTask Javadoc.
