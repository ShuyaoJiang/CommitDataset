Avoid referencing ContiguousSet directly in Range, instead just using SortedSet.  This actually constitutes a general optimization, since we make it O(1) for all SortedSets and not just ContiguousSets, but it also makes a big difference to ProGuard:

91546 bytes => 59989 bytes
42 classes => 15 classes
328 methods => 114 methods
