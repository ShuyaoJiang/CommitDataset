Fix for Android crash caused by mis-aligned call of Unsafe.getLong on a 4-byte aligned field offset.

Any use of Unsafe to read java arrays of "another type" is dangerous
and unsupported (by Unsafe), so fall back to safe java more
conservatively, unless we are running 64-bit java with 8-byte aligned
byte array offset.  This leaves the Big Java Server optimizations in place.
