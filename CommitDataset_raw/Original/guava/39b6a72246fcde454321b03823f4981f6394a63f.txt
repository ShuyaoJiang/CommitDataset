Rewrite TreeRangeSet.complement() to be implemented in the same way as TreeRangeSet itself -- as a NavigableMap<Cut<C>, Range<C>> mapping lower bounds to ranges.

This is a prelude to implementing TreeRangeSet.subRangeSet, which -- itself implemented as a NavigableMap<Cut<C>, Range<C>> -- will be chainable with complement() operations.
