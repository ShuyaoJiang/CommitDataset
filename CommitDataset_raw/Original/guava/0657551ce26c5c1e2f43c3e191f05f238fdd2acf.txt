Changes to the LinearTransformation API: add inverse(), remove transformY(y), and rename transformX(x) to transform(x). Note that inverse().transform(y) is the new transformY(y).

The inverse is lazily initialized, following the pattern used in Converter. (This doesn't to any double-checked locking or anything, which is presumably okay because in the unlikely event of a race, constructing it twice is not the end of the world.)

TGP appears to show nothing but flakes: [][]
