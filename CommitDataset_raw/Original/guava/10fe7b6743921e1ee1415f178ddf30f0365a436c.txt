Skip GWT tests by default.

The fact that they "hang" (i.e., take ~8 hours) confused the reporter of http://stackoverflow.com/q/43040327/28465, and I suspect he's not the first.
Plus, I mean, who wants to wait 8 hours? :)
I've updated our release docs to explicitly turn on GWT tests during the main test command.
