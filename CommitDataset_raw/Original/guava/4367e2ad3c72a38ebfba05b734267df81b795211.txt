Use SortedMapTestSuiteBuilder and NavigableMapTestSuiteBuilder more widely.
This requires two improvements:
- Generalize NullsBeforeB, intended for use with test elements "a", "b", "c", etc., to introduce NullsBeforeTwo, intended for use with test elements "one", "two", "three", ....
- Do not require SortedMap keySet() to be a SortedSet (as the interface doesn't require this).
