Annotate some flaky slow tests as @AndroidIncompatible.

These tests appear to have become flakier around CL 148237028 -- probably mostly because it removed @AndroidIncompatible from one method but perhaps because of the changes in implementations of some of the other methods. (I even wonder if changes to the implementations of some tests are causing other tests to fail, given the number of new failures I saw in unrelated tests in my "After" run. Or maybe that's just an artifact of small sample size.)
