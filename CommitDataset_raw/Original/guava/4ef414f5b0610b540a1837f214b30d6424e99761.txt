Add AbstractPackageSanityTests.UNDERSCORE_IN_NAME to make it easy to exclude generated classes like AutoValue_Foo from testing. The issue is that these classes typically do not apply @Nullable to the argument of equals(Object), so that they will work when Nullable is not on the classpath. But NullPointerTester requires @Nullable on this argument because otherwise it will fail when equals(null) follows its contract and does not throw an exception.
