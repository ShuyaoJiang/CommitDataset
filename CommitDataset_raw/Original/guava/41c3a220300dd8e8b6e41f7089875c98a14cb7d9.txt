Fix buggy test identified by CollectionIncompatibleType.
The test was calling get(class) instead of get(typeToken).
The test still passes, since it was expected a null return value -- exactly what it gets for a key that isn't present.
I've also added containsKey() and entrySet().contains() checks to verify that the null value really is present.
