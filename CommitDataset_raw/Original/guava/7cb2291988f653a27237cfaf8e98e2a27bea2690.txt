Instead of using the SortedLists utility class, go straight to Collections.binarySearch in the implementation of RegularImmutableSortedSet.

SortedLists is a much nicer API, but it carries a decent chunk of code weight that we can lose without a problem, and we don't need its fancier features of dealing with multiple elements comparing as equal -- the point of a SortedSet is that we don't have to worry about those.
