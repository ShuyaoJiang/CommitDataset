Javadoc improvements:
- Emphasize that an empty SetMultimap and an empty ListMultimap are equal.
- ListenableFuture listeners can also run in the thread that cancels the future (hat tip to <https://plus.google.com/114212977194801425439/posts/eFxZv6ibkM9>, which tipped me off to this by describing a related bug)... plus other minor improvements.
- ListeningExecutorService can throw RejectedExecutionException.
- Subclasses of AbstractListeningExecutorService must implement execute() and the shutdown/termination methods.
Also, fix a comment in AbstractListeningExecutorServiceTest.
