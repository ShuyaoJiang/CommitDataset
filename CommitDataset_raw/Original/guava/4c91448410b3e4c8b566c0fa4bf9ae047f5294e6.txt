Some documentation improvements for Ascii.truncate.

Also remove the overload that used "..." as a default truncation indicator because:
- Some people might assume that it used no truncation indicator ("")
- It's easier to understand when reading if the indicator is passed explicitly
- No need to warn people about "..." not being what they want to use for some locales
