Optimize the GWT TimeUnit library in terms of performance.

Background:
Long divisions in GWT are expensive because there is no "long" type in Javascript and the GWT emulates them. When the TimeUnit library is used in a hot loop, it causes perfomance issues.

Solution:
The long divisions are extracted into precomputed constants.
