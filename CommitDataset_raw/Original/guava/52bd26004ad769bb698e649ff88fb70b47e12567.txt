Standardize that Functions.foo().toString() returns "Functions.foo()." (I've preserved two existing exceptions: compose(b, a) (which returns "b(a)") and forMap(map, default) (which returns "Functions.forMap(map, defaultValue=default)"). I don't know whether that's ideal, but it doesn't feel worth spending too much time worrying about.)
This matches what Predicates.foo().toString() and Ordering.foo().toString() return.

(Also, remove some unnecessary toString() calls from Predicates.java. Those changes would have been made in CL 58115976 (successor to CL 56242188) except that that change was made concurrently with a CL just like the one you're reading but for Predicates (CL 59050444).)
