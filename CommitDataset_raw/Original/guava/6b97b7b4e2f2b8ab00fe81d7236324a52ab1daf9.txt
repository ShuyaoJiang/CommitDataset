Added new API to allow filtering methods by return types:

new ClassSanityTester()
.forAllPublicStaticMethods(Iterables.class)
.thatReturn(Iterable.class)
.testNulls();

This better targets the tests against methods that need to be tested, and avoid pointless failures for methods that don't need to be tested.
