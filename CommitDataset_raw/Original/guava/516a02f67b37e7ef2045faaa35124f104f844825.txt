Enable tests that are newly runnable under GWT:

- some immediateFailedFuture tests, which we missed when making immediateFailedFuture work under GWT.
- some tests that uses TestLogHandler now that TestLogHandler works under GWT.

Also, rename a logger variable to reflect the recent CombinedFuture->AggregateFuture rename.
