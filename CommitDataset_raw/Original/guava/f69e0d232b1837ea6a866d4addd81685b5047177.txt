Create PriorityQueue with internal capacity 2 instead of estimating the size from the number of inputs.
This is simpler, and it might be faster than iterating twice.
It might be slower if the input (a) is a Collection (so that size() is available) and (b) is larger than size 2 (so that growing the array is necessary), but I'm not too concerned.
Only 2 of ~8 callers have a chance of passing in more than 2 inputs, anyway.
