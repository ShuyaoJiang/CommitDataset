Disable doclint when building under JDK8.

Because it complains about everything and fails the build.

Also fix something that my IDE was marking as an error: the <overWrite> element from the configuration for the maven-dependency-plugin isn't valid for the unpack-dependencies goal (there's <overWriteIfNewer>, but it's true by default), so I removed it.
