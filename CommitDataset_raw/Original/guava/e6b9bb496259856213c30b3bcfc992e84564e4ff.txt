Fix bug where Multiset.elementSet.remove did not propagate changes to Multiset.size.

This fix is not the most efficient, and incurs unnecessary allocation in Multiset.elementSet iteration, but is a tolerable workaround until we do something more sophisticated.

RELNOTES=Fixed bug in Multiset.elementSet.remove in Android branch.
