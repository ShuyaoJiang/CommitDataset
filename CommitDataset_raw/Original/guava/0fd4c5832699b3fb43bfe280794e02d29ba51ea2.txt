Collect all resource URLs in the ResourceInfo objects.

Essentially ResourceInfo.url() is analogous to Class.getResource() and now
ResourceInfo.urls() provides analogous support for Class.getResources() with the benefit that it is significantly faster (ClassPath was already calculating these as part of scanning).

This is yet another attempt at trying to add a way to see alternate resources to classpath.
