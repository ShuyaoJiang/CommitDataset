Re-enable compilation of benchmarks in Guava now that caliper 1.0-beta-2 is out.

Fix some things this turned up:

- Remove a couple benchmarks for APIs that aren't public in Guava.
- Remove LoadingCache benchmarks that compare a LoadingCache to MapMaker.makeComputingMap, which is package-private now.
- Fix a usage of diamond operator that snuck in.
- Remove CombinedFuture from Futures, since the methods that use it are internal-only.
