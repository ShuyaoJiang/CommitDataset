When displaying the actual class name, use the simple name.
(Note that GWT has supported getSimpleName() since 2.6.0.)

We started doing this for the expected class name in CL 115380685 by passing literal strings like "IllegalStateException" to the constructor.
But I also made some changes to make this more obvious.
