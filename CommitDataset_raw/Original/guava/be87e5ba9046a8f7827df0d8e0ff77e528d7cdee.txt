Annotate AbstractFuture with @DoNotMock.

Ideally we'd annotate ListenableFuture itself, but I don't want to go down the road of fixing or suppressing all existing violations right now.
I'm doing even AbstractFuture only because it will soon become a subclass of FluentFuture, which we want to be @DoNotMock.
