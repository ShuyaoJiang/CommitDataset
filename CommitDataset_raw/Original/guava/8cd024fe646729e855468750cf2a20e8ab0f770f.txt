Make Collections2.orderedPermutations work under GWT again.
To do so, make the minimal (I think) subset of common.math required work under GWT.
This requires suppressing a few cases in the divide() tests due to GWT's non-compliant int implementation (which, for example, occasionally believes that 2147483648 is a valid int).
