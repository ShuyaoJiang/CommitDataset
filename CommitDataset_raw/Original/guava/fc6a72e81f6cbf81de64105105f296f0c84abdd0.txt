- Fix scheduleWithFixed(Delay|Rate). As originally implemented, scheduleWithFixed(Delay|Rate) would submit a Callable/Runnable wrapped in a FutureTask to the delegate ScheduledExecutorService and fail to run more than once due to run-once nature of FutureTask.
- Implement cancel(boolean) on the returned LSFuture.
- Omit FakeScheduledExecutorService changes.
