Adds a small clarifying comment to the Javadoc of common.cache.RemovalListener.

My team was previously assuming that calls to CacheLoader.load and RemovalListener.onRemoval would always be paired, but we found out this is not the case.

In retrospect, the existing Javadoc already hints at this, but I think it can be made a bit more explicit.
