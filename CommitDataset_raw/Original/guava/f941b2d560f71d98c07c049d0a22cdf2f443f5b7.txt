An optimization for Graphs and Networks, inspired by Michael. Introduce "MapIteratorCache" and "MapRetrievalCache". MapIteratorCache is extremely light-weight and optimizes the follow case:

for (N node : graph.nodes()) {
  graph.foo(node);
}

while MapRetrievalCache is slightly heavier and additionally optimizes the following cases:

graph.foo(node);
graph.bar(node);

OR

graph.foo(node1);
graph.foo(node2);
graph.bar(node1);
graph.bar(node2);
