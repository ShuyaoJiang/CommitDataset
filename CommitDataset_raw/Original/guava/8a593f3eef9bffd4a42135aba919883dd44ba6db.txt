Refer to the old names of transformAsync and catchingAsync from their @since tags.

We have done this elsewhere, e.g., "@since 9.0 (in 1.0 as {@code compose})"
It should make migration easier for anyone who skips over the version of Guava in which the old method was deprecated.
It should also help both internal and external users who go looking for the old name.
