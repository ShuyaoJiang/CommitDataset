Graph.java: break out mutation- and edge-specific methods into subinterfaces:
* Network.java: edge-specific methods (extends Graph)
* MutableGraph.java: mutation methods for Graph (extends Graph)
* MutableNetwork.java: mutation methods for Network (extends Network)
Graph<N, E> becomes Graph<N>.

Consequential changes:
* adding various new Network-specific classes (NetworkBuilder, AbstractNetwork, etc.)
* adapted Graph-specific classes to remove edge-related code

Note: Graph does not currently support parallel edges.

Motivations:
* Make graphs without explicit, first-class edge objects available.
* Remove mutation methods from the top-level interfaces so that Graph/Network objects supplied as their parameters don't (contractually) support modifications.  (And so that the slightly differing signatures for Graph and Network mutation methods don't cause user confusion.)
