Define equality for Graphs so that a Graph never equals a ValueGraph. This allows ValueGraphs to have the expected behavior when you query valueGraphA.equals(valueGraphB) (i.e. values are taken into account as well).

Since ValueGraph now defines its own equals/hashcode, add AbstractValueGraph to facilitate clients getting this behavior.

Add ValueGraph versions of copyOf() and inducedSubgraph().

Add a package-private ForwardingGraph class for the non-value graph classes (ConfigurableMutableGraph, ImmutableGraph) to use.

Rename AbstractConfigurable* classes to Configurable* (and make non-abstract).
