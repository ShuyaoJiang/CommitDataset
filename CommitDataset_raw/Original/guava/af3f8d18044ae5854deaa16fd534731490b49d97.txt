This CL fixes null annotations in com.google.common.primitives

The annotations on the tryParse() methods are inconsistent. Many of them don't have @Nullable annotations. This is problematic, because: a) the method can return null; and b) the package itself is annotated with @ParametersAreNonnullByDefault. This causes Eclipse to display dead code warnings when checking the return value from these methods.

I've included the @CheckForNull annotation, since I saw you guys using it already. Technically, this isn't required and @Nullable by itself should be fine. But it doesn't hurt to have both. Also Eclipse doesn't understand @CheckForNull.

I also threw in a few @Nullable on equals() methods that were missing.
