Prevent fail() from being ignored by the surrounding catch() block by throwing new Error().

Tests of a testing API often look like this:

try {
  runATestThatShouldFail();
  fail();
} catch (AssertionError expected) {
}

However, the catch() block can catch not only the expected failure from runATestThatShouldFail() but also the "test did not fail when it should have" failure from fail().

This an automated fix using Error Prone ([]

We intend to make this a compilation error in []'s Java compiler,
so it is necessary to fix existing occurrences first to avoid breaking
builds.
