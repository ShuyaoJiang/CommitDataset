"subType" -> "subtype"
"superType" -> "supertype"

"Subtype" is one word, according to various dictionary and to our usage in public methods on TypeToken and MediaType.
"Supertype" is not as 100% clear in the dictionary, but when a dictionary or other document mentions it, I see it as one word. I also see precedent in "Class.getSuperclass."
