Recognize @NullableDecl in NullPointerTester and friends.

Also, migrate common.testing to itself be annotated with @NullableDecl, rather than @Nullable.
I could claim that I did this as a small-scale test, but honestly I just didn't feel like pulling the "real" changes of this CL out from the @NullableDecl migrations already present in my client :)
