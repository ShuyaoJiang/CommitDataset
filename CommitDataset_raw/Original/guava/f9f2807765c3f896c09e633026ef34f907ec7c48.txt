Add FluentFuture.from(FluentFuture) factory method.

This follows the steps of FluentIterable.from(FluentIterable) and other
“migration aid” methods that are deprecated from inception and are just here to
point out code that is no longer needed.

RELNOTES=Added deprecated `FluentFuture.from(FluentFuture)` to point out redundant code.
