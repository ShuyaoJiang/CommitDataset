Make Javadoc output quieter.

The important stuff is still there: See below. (I inserted the ERROR from an earlier version of []it's not present at HEAD or that in CL.)

[INFO] --- maven-javadoc-plugin:2.10.4:javadoc (default-cli) @ guava ---
[ERROR] Error fetching link: https://checkerframework.org/api//package-list. Ignored it.
[INFO]

I think you had silenced some other plugins not too long ago. Maybe it just wasn't clear how to silence this one, since it uses a Javadoc-specific flag? But if there's a reason to avoid quiet here, let me know.
