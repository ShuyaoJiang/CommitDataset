Suppress tests under Android:
- EasyMock, since class extension doesn't work there
- BloomFilter tests where Android runs out of memory
- a couple other tests where Android appears to disagree about String.format rounding

(These tests don't actually run on Android at HEAD yet, but they will soon.)
