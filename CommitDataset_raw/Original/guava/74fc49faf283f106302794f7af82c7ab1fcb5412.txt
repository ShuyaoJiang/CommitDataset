Use J2ObjC's @RetainedWith annotation instead of @Weak on
ImmutableMap.entrySet() to prevent crashes on iOS.

TESTED=Created a map inside an autorelease pool and saved a reference to the
entry set. Checked that the entry set functions correctly outside the
autorelease pool. Checked that both the entry set and the are deallocated by the
autorelease pool when not holding a strong reference to the entry set. Did this
test with the following constructions to cover all entry set implementations:
- ImmutableMap.of(<2 entries>)
- ImmutableMap.copyOf(<EnumMap with 2 entries>)
- ImmutableSortedMap.of(<2 entries>)
- ImmutableBiMap.of(<2 entries>).inverse()

RELNOTES=J2ObjC: Fixes crashes from use of ImmutableMap.entrySet().
