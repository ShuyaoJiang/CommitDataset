Add AtomicDouble and friends.

All derived from code originally written by Doug and friends
for AtomicLong and friends.

This version has marginally less efficient, but more portable
implementation (doesn't directly use sun.misc.Unsafe).

Updates JSR166TestCase to get latest Doug/Martin infrastructure.

Currently, AtomicDouble seems unlikely to get into upstream
java.util.concurrent.atomic, (so guava is likely to be its
permanent public home) but I'd like to continue to keep the
door open forever.
