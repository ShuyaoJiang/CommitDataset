De-@Beta Stopwatch.

See https://github.com/google/guava/issues/1312 (we were holding off on the
de-@Beta'ing because we wanted to remove the public constructors).

The only other API change we might want to make is to add toString(TimeUnit)
(https://github.com/google/guava/issues/2007) but that shouldn't stop us from
de-@Beta'ing it now, right?
