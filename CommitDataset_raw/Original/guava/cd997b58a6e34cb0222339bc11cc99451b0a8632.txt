Disable incorrect @GuardedBy annotations.

The @GuardedBy annotations in this CL did not follow the JCIP semantics: either
they referred to locks that did not exist, or they were being used for general
documentation.

The annotations are being replaced with comments in preparation for enabling
static analysis of @GuardedBy annotations.

Tested:
TAP presubmits for global presubmit queue
[]Some tests failed; test failures are believed to be unrelated to this CL
