Remove deprecated methods that had been hanging around without specified removal dates / Guava versions:
- ImmutableSet.of(E[]), which has been replaced by copyOf(E[]) and which was removed from the "plain Java" code long ago but has hung around in the GWT version.
- InternetDomainName.fromLenient() and name(), which have been replaced by from() and toString().
