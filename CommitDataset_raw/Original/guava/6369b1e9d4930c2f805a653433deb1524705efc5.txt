Remove Platform.charBufferFromThreadLocal layer of indirection, which existed for GWT purposes.
It hasn't been used from GWT code since the escapers were moved from common.base to common.escape.
Its one remaining (Google-internal) caller was never GWT compatible, so the caller didn't actually need to use the method (though it has done so since its creation back in CL 24637091).
