Make KNOWN_ORDER significant for Map tests.
(There are no direct Map tests using KNOWN_ORDER, but we now pass KNOWN_ORDER on to our keySet, entrySet, and values sub-suites.)
Start using KNOWN_ORDER in various tests, including automatically in all SortedMap and SortedSet tests.
Introduce TestStringSortedMapGenerator to save us from having to write "sort(insertionOrder, Helpers.<String, String>entryComparator(Ordering.natural().nullsFirst()));" as an order() implementation over and over.
