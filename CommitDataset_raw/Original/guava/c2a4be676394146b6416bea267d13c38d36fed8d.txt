This CL fixes invalid self-referential collection operations (c.addAll(c), c.removeAll(c), c.retainAll(c), and c.containsAll(c)). Such cases are either no-ops, undefined behavior, or unnecessarily complicated, and often reveal bugs. This an automated fix using error-prone.

We intend to make this a compilation error in Google's Java compiler, so it is necessary to fix existing occurrences first to avoid breaking builds.
