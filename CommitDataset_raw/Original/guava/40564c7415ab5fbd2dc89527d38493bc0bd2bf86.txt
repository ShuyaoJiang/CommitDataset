[guava concurrent] Upstreamed a modified form of the modified interruption behaviour from a fork of SerializingExecutor. Documented and tested the behaviour thoroughly.

RELNOTES=Adjusted the interruption behaviour of MoreExecutors.sequentialExecutor() to run tasks without a Thread interrupt marked (previously, interrupts leaked between tasks). If the Thread was interrupted when the Executor received it or during execution of its tasks, the thread will be re-interrupted before being yielded. Expanded the documentation of MoreExecutors.sequentialExecutor() to cover interruption and rejected execution behaviour in detail.
