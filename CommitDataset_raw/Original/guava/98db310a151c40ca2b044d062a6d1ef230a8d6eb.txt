Fix Guava GWT module:
- Issue 961: Release java.nio.charset.Charset module to Guava.
- Remove bogus @GwtCompatible annotation from ForwardingDeque... and remove commented annotation from MinMaxPriorityQueue.  (IIRC, we have a hack in one of our many levels of processing that just looks for the literal string "@GwtCompatible.")
