Fix #1190

Before this fix, splitting a single character input string with a
Splitter.onPattern instance created with a zero-width regex pattern,
would have caused the input string to be dropped from the output,
resulting in an empty iterable being returned rather than a single
element one.

This fix ensures that the input passes through untouched.

For example, whereas before in this code snippet, 'words' would have
been initialized as an empty iterable...

   String string = "f";
   Iterable<String> words =
       Splitter.on(Pattern.compile("\\b")).split(string);
   // words is empty!

Fixes #2615, #2086
