Add the methods Graphs.reachableNodes() and Graphs.transitiveClosure(). Three teams have already implemented similar logic! Also, looking through the remaining uses of the legacy Digraph, the only thing preventing many from being converted to common.graph is the lack of transitive closure. So I'd say there's very high demand for this.
