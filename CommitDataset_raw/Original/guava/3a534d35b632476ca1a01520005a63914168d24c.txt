Actually fix tearDown handling that was made worse in CL 50062431.
- The behavior before that CL was to ignore exceptions thrown by tearDown.
- The behavior currently is to exceptions thrown by tearDown unless there was another exception thrown by the test itself, in which case we overwrite the test's exception with the tearDown's exception.
- The new behavior is to respect the exception from tearDown unless an exception from the test itself exists to override it. This matches the JUnit behavior. Really.

This time, I've added (internal-only) tests.
I also improved some error logging in the tests while I was debugging.
