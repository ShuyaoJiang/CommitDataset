Swap the parameter order of the Collections.disjoint call in Sets.intersection

Collections.disjoint is implemented in such a way that it has better
performance if its 2nd parameter is the smaller of the two when both params are
instances of Set. The Sets.intersection javadoc says it has better performance
when set1 is the smaller set, but that is currently not the case for the
isEmpty operation specifically.

Our team ran into a pathological case of this where we check for an empty
intersection of two sets, one being ~5 orders of magnitude larger than the
other.

RELNOTES=Update isEmpty operation of intersection to follow the smaller set first advice in the javadoc.
