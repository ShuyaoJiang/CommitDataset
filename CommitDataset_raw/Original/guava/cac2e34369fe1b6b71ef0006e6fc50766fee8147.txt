Have ImmutableMaps for zero and one element use RegularImmutableMap instead of {Empty,Singleton}ImmutableBiMap, avoiding pulling in ImmutableBiMap and all its dependencies.

The increase in the size of singleton maps does require an increase in the constant overhead in MemoryTester for immutable multimaps and tables, but a constant overhead isn't worth that much concern.  (We might come back to work on these when we start trying to improve multimap and table size, though.)

Effects on ImmutableMapProGuard: ([]59284 bytes => 52710 bytes
64 classes => 57 classes
363 methods => 312 methods
