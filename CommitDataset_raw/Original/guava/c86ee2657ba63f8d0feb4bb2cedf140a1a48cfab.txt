Remove unused configuration of load factor

This allows removal of loadFactor/threshold which saves 8 bytes per object.

While here:
- Reduce diff between Map/Set classes
- Make base forEach() work for Linked classes

Shallow object size (bytes):
- CompactHashMap: 64 -> 56
- CompactLinkedHashMap: 80 -> 72
- CompactHashSet: 40 -> 32
- CompactLinkedHashSet: 56 -> 48
