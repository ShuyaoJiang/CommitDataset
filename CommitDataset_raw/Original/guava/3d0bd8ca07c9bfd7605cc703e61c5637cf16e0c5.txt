Trivial cleanups:
- Remove stray paren in Ordering Javadoc.
- Fix runnable/executor confusion in ExecutionQueue Javadoc.
- Fix MockingModuleTester and FastStackTracer links that refer to type parameter T instead of its valid name, the erased type Object. Fix a few @see errors while there.
- Remove "This class is GWT compatible" comments, which have been redundant since we began using @GwtCompatible in testlib code.
- "unreasonable slow" => "unreasonably slow"
- Fix continued-line indent in Invokable.
- Insert spaces in cast expressions.
- Add missing spaces before open braces.
