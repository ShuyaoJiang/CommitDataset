Simplify ImmutableCollection implementation and related code.  Specifically:

* Redirect ImmutableCollection default serialization to ImmutableList, which it was basically emulating before
* Factor out "handwritten ArrayList" logic from Immutable{List,Set}.Builder
* Be more organized in ImmutableList creation pathways about where and when null validation is done
* Use default List iterator implementation in ImmutableList.ReverseImmutableList
* Use default List implementations for RegularImmutableList.{equals, toString}
* Push down ArrayImmutableSet logic to its one and only subclass, RegularImmutableSet
* Optimize ImmutableSortedSet creation paths, e.g. to avoid creating any garbage in duplicate-free common case
