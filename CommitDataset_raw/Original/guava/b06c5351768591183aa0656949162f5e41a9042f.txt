Migrate calls of to-be-deprecated Futures.java APIs to their equivalents:
- Migrate calls from transform(...AsyncFunction...) to transformAsync().
- Migrate calls from withFallback(future, new FutureFallback<V>) to catching(future, Throwable.class, new AsyncFunction<Throwable, V>()) (or occasionally a slight variant of that).
