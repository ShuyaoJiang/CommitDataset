*** Original change description ***

Automated g4 rollback of changelist 108184450.

*** Reason for rollback ***

Change no longer needed, j2cl transpiler was updated.

*** Original change description ***

Remove import for java.util.Formatter since it's needed only for the javadoc.
This class is not supported by GWT and in the new version of GWT (J2CL) we plan to strip not needed imports only if the class/method is marked with @GwtIncompatible.
