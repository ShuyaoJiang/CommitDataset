Make mutable directed graphs about 40% smaller. Another nifty benefit: directedGraph.adjacentNodes(node).size() is now O(1). Remove (unused) equals/hashcode impl from NodeAdjacencies.

Interestingly, this does make immutable directed graphs slightly larger. The exact % depends on the degree of the nodes. inDegree == 1 and outDegree == 1 is a particularly large increase because two SingletonImmutableSets is much smaller than one ImmutableMap with two entries.
