Avoid mentioning ImmutableSortedSet in the ImmutableSet implementation.

I'm not sure why ProGuard couldn't strip this out already, but ImmutableSortedSet and several of *its* dependencies were getting retained when ProGuard stripped ImmutableSet, and this fixes it.

Effects on ImmutableSetProGuard: ([]37524 bytes => 31249 bytes
34 classes => 28 classes
263 methods => 198 methods
