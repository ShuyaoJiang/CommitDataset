Store the CancellationException.class (as we do in other tests), not the cause of the CancellationException.

The cause is null nowadays, so we were presumably never taking the if() branch at line 467.
That meant that we weren't actually checking isCancelled().
A comment also suggests that we could theoretically have seen test failures because it was possible for setFuture to also succeed, but I don't think we've seen that in practice. I have spent 0 seconds thinking about whether there's anything deeper to ponder here.

(I noticed this while migrating to multicatch. This CL also adopts multicatch in one place where it does make sense.)
