Migrate Caliper benchmarks from the old, superclass-based API to the new, annotation-based API.

More information: LSC: Caliper Benchmark API migration (https://docs.google.com[]document/d/15KUhmIsTVn0EA9u2S5es4Otn5k3Lo_ZHhkDsT9LYRKc)

ATTENTION REVIEWERS: This is a (mostly) scripted, behavior-preserving change. It should have the following effect:
- No longer extend c.g.caliper.legacy.Benchmark
- setUp method overrides are now annotated with @BeforeExperiment
- tearDown method overrides are now annotated with @AfterExperiment
- time methods are now annotated with @Benchmark and the time prefix has been removed

Tested:
ran test_all_benchmarks
