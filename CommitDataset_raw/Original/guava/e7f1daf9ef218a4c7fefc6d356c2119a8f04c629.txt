Reimplement legacy RateLimiter as a passthrough to its reimplementation under the new RateLimiter API.
I've mostly attempted to leave the behavior untouched, but there are a few changes:
- Fixed a bug that would arise with a negative nanoTime() (probably unlikely, but it could happen).
- Removed logging.
- Stop swallowing interrupts.
