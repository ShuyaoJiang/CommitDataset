Switching to non-power-of-2 bloom filter sizes, and making serialization more
future-proof.
Unfortunately, this changes the serialized form, since hashBitsPerFunction was
hardwired
to the BloomFilter, and that really assumed power-of-two tables.
Also, this fixes a nasty exponential-slowdown bug that was in the previous version of BloomFilter (that code was added to support serialization, and deleted as part of the new strategy for serialization)
