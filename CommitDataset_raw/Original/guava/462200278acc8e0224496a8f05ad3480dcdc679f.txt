Suppress tests under Android.
- ByteStreamsTest.testNewDataOutput_writeChars may show a legitimate bug, whether in our code or in the Android library.
- CloserTest.testCreate looks up the JDK version. We should update this to look up the Android version if applicable.
- Android seems to have trouble with:
  - nested test classes
  - test classes without default constructors (which are necessarily constructed in suite() methods).

I've also improved some failure messages in ByteStreamsTest.

(Note that we don't actually run these tests on Android at HEAD. This will be changing soon.)
