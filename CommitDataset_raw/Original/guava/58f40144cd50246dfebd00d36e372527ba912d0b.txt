Add ValueGraph.edgeValues(). Remove ValueGraph.edgeValueOrDefault(node, node).

There's a few nice things we get out of this. An easy way to address all the values in a ValueGraph as a single collection (edgeValues().values()). An easy way to get an edge value if you're dealing with "EndpointPair"s. And if you're on Java 8+, Map has getOrDefault() plus some other nifty methods.
