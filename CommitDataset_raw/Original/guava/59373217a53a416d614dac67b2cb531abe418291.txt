Add a more efficient implementation of Sets.symmetricDifference.

Background: was looking through the Guava code and came upon a TODO.

An even more efficient implementation could involve using a special consuming iterator to first return the items that are in set 1 but not in set 2, and then add the items from set 2 that weren't consumed (because they aren't in set 1); however, that would either modify the original set or have to use more space.
