Rollforward [] which was rolled back in [] because it
caused some tests using appengine to fail with IOExceptions when calling
FileInputStream.available().  The workaround in the rollforward is to not call
the method.  The one case where we were calling it we had actually already
called a similar method, so trying again doesn't seem valuable anyway.

*** Original change description ***

Implement ByteSource.asCharSource(charset).read() using the decoding string
constructor instead of streaming the contents into a StringBuilder.

this allows us to avoid a number of copies that are currently happening for
each character (1. into a temporary CharBuffer, 2. into a StringBuilder, 3 into
the String char[]) and replace it with simply whatever is required by
ByteSource.read() and the String(byte[], charset) constructor.  For certain
ByteSource implementations (like FileByteSource) ByteSource.read() can often
presize the byte[] correctly and the string constructor can also do some things
to guess at the correct array sizes and avoid copies in the common case.

Benchmarks have shown that this should improve the speed of Files.toString
significantly.
