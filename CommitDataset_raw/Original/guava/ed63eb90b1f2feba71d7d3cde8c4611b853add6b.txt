Completely overhaul top-level javadoc for common.graph interfaces in light of the new interface hierarchy. Spend a lot of time answering what I think will be the #1 question users have: should I use a Graph or a Network? Spend a lot less time defining graph theory terms, that's what wikipedia is for :) plus the method-level javadoc defines terms as necessary. Overall, make it a lot more concise. Javadoc that's too long for anyone to bother reading is just as good as javadoc that doesn't exist!

Also, ran g4 fix on these files.
