Miscellaneous cleanups.
- Remove "final" from "static final" methods, as it has little meaning there.
- In "Expired entries may be counted in Cache.size,", change "in" to "by" to match similar change to MapMaker.
- Remove line-starting @ so that AbstractInvocationHandler code snippet isn't truncated.
- Insert some spaces after casts in PopulatedCachesTest.
