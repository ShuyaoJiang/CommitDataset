Fix test that will fail in an upcoming patch to GWT.

The semantics for String.toUpperCase() are that of the JavaScript browser implementation and might not conform to their JRE specification.

In FF "pa\u00dfword".toUpperCase() is not "PASSWORD"; however the test was succeeding in GWT due to a pass of static evaluation that was done in the GWT compiler. The GWT compiler is removing all optimizations from -draftCompile and in that scenario the test fails.
