Remove incorrect Javadoc.

It looks like we got this wrong back in CL 62226066 (from https://codereview.appspot.com/58760044/patch/1/10006): The tests aren't identical. One tests a null key; the other, a null value. Does that sound right?

(Motivation: The @link in the Javadoc is broken, so we're getting warnings from the Guava build.)
