Added TypeVisitor to make it easier to navigate type hierarchy, and used it to replace a few code duplications.

TypeVisitor might be able to become something that's releasable for users to check on individual sub-components of a Type. Or, if after learning use cases, all that's needed are hasTypeVariables() and hasWildcards(), we'll just add the higher level APIs.
