Wrap the Method.setAccessible call in Types.TypeVariableInvocationHandler in try/catch so that it is not an error for it to fail.

Usually setAccessible won't be necessary: we only added it because of App Engine's unusual execution environment. TypesTest now runs with a SecurityManager so we can detect this and similar problems.
