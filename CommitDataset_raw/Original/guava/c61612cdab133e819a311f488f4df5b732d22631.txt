Add ByteSource, ByteSink, CharSource and CharSink abstract classes and factory methods for creating various implementations of them.

These classes are intended to replace the InputSupplier and OutputSupplier interfaces, providing advantages such as: no generics, a more consistent interface that reduces the need for static methods, and better discoverability.

This helps pave the way for JDK7 by making it extremely easy to provide the same features for the new file APIs (Path) that we currently provide for Files, etc. All it will require is adding new factory methods to create Sources and Sinks wrapping a Path.
