Makes copyNodes() and copyEdges() @GoogleInternal. kevinb mentioned earlier that he thinks those methods should be @GoogleInternal for now.

Also, change copyOf() slightly to have separate impls for the predicate and non-predicate versions. The non-predicate version can be slightly more efficient by avoiding incident node containment checks when adding edges.
