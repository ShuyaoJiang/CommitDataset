Make the copying done for guava-gwt not verbose.

This is the only thing I haven't been able to suppress by using -q or a flag to suppress output for specific plugins. It might be there's some flag for the antrun plugin that could be used in some way to make this not verbose, but I'm not sure what (and to me it doesn't seem like there's much need to see this output anyway).
