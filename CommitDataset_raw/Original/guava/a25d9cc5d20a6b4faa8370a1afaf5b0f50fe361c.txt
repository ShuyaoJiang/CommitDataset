Specify behavior with self-loops in degree() javadoc.

Wikipedia states: "the degree (or valency) of a vertex of a graph is the number of edges incident to the vertex, with loops counted twice". I've found several primary sources that also state the same. But Wolfram has this definition: "The degree of a graph vertex v of a graph G is the number of graph edges which touch v" with no mention of self-loops.

With directed graphs it would be easy to get this behavior (just return inDegree + outDegree), but with undirected graphs you would either need to store more information than we currently do or make this an O(D) method instead of O(1). Overall I'm not sure how many people care so probably not worth changing, but at least worth calling out in the javadoc.
