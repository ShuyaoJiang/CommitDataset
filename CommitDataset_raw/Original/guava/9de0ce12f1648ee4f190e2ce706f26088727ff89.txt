In the FinalizableReferenceQueue code, remove the unnecessary nested exception
class Finalizer.ShutDown, which could cause problems if the URL for the
classfile of Finalizer was not related in the obvious way to the URL for the
classfile of Finalizer.ShutDown. This is Guava issue 1505
<https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/issues/detail?id=1505> reported by
Jesse Glick <jglick@cloudbees.com>, and the fix is based on the patch he linked
to there.

Also add a test to ensure that Finalizer doesn't acquire other nested classes
in the future.
