Clear FallbackFuture.running, this used to be the behavior but it was lost when updating this method to use setFuture.

This fixes: https://github.com/google/guava/issues/1937

In addition to not pinning the input future, i also changed it so that a call to cancel() prior to the input completing, does not trigger a CancellationException in the listener.
