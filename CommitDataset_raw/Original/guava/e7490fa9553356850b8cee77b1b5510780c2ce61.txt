For APIs that require Java 7, strip them from Guava-Android entirely, not just from our internal copy of Guava-Android.
This prevents a third-party library from using them, only to fail when used with our internal Guava-Android.

To accomplish that, we use @GoogleInternal instead of @AndroidIncompatible, but we use it only on the Java 7 branch.

For context, see my belated comment on CL 138100073.
