Stop using ByteArrayOutputStream in ByteStreams.toByteArray methods.

They were using ByteStreams.copy to copy the source to the BAOS. This meant reading from the source into a buffer, then copying from that buffer to a different buffer in the BAOS. Additionally, the way BAOS operates is not great: whenever it needs more space, it creates a new array twice as large as the previous, copies all bytes from the previous array to the new one, and discards the previous array.

Instead, read directly from the source into a sequence of buffers. When a buffer fills up, don't discard it, but instead create a new, twice as large, buffer and start reading into it.
