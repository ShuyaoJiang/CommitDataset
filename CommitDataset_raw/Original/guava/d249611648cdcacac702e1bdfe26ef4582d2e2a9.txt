Add maven metadata and a faux maven project hierarchy for multi-module support to build this as several smaller maven modules, as well as the monolithic jar.

Also, add a README.maven to talk about this in general

Lastly, add a note in README about needing a 1.5 JDK that includes the @Overrides patch, since we use @Overrides to override interface methods, not just concrete/abstract class methods.
