Fix REE handling in SerializingExecutor.

The old implementation had two bugs:
1. Tasks that threw RejectedExecutionException on submission would still execute later
2. Two threads submitting to an idle SequentialExecutor might see one submission succeed, even if the delegate threw REE. The submitted task wouldn't run until someone else successfully submitted another task.

This costs a possible extra lock acquisition  (to solve #2) and an allocation (to solve #1) when submitting to a SequentialExecutor that doesn't already have worker scheduled or running.
