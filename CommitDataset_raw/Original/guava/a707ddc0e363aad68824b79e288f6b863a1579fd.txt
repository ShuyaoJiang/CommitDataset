Update link to GWT docs that died with Google Code.

The best substitute I've found is a commit diff email.

The copy of the page carried over from Google Code to Github doesn't include the relevant information, and it didn't come with history:
https://github.com/gwtproject/old_google_code_wiki/commits/master/ResourceOracle.wiki.md
