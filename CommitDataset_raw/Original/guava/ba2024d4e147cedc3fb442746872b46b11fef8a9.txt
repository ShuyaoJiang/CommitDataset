Fixes, standardizations, and noise reduction in Futures tests.

- Run more tests under GWT (and fix some @GwtIncompatible reason documentation). This required no actual changes to the tests except...
- Make testSuccessfulAsList_resultCancelledRacingInputDone look at the correct logger now that we've moved most listener execution to AbstractFuture.
- Retrieve that logger with getLogger() rather than from the class under test's `log` field.
- Use TestLogHandler instead of our custom throwing handler.
- Move RuntimeExceptionThrowingFuture out of FutureCallbackTest, and use it in FuturesTest instead of our hacked up solutions that happen to work today.
- Test both overloads of get() for some immediate*Future() implementations.
- Go crazy with static imports, even by my standards.
- Rename expected exceptions to "expected," and remove comments about their expectedness.
- Remove descriptions from fail() calls.
- Remove a redundant immediateFuture() test.
- Use Truth in a few places.
- Use getDone() for various reasons:
  - It will let tests work under GWT if I remove get() there.
  - It sometimes saves us an isDone() assertion.
  - It prevents some tests from hanging in the case of a bug.
  - It doesn't declare `throws InterruptedException`, so in theory, we might be able to remove some `throws` clauses. (But I haven't done so.)
- Add a getDoneFromTimeoutOverload() with a custom GWT implementation to prepare for losing timed get() there.

Left for later CLs:
- reformatting everything
- splitting FuturesTest into separate classes
