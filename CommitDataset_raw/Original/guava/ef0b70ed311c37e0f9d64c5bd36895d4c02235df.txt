Mark methods in Graphs that take a Predicate as @GoogleInternal until we can migrate to JDK 8's Predicate. Rename the merge*From() methods to copy*(). Change the behavior of copyEdges from copying over all edges (and adding incident nodes as necessary) to only copying over edges where the incident nodes are already present (and thus not adding any additional nodes), as was discussed in API review.
