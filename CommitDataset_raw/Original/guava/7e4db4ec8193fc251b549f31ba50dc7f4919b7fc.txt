To generate random hashable things, use Random instead of Object hash codes.

Apparently Object hash codes are not particularly random on Gingerbread, under which we run our tests (though they're better by Marshmallow).
Perhaps the "best" hash functions can deal with this, but we've seen a few hash functions that sometimes generate more collisions than our tests permit.

This made their tests flaky.

I couldn't identify any particular reason for the use of hash codes over Random.
