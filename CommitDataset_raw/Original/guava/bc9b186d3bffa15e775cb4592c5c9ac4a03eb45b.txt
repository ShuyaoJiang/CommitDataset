Fix comment bug.

The comment suggests that the cause of an ExecutionException is passed
in to 'mapper', but that isn't the case according to:
https://cs.[]/#[]/java/com/google/common/util/concurrent/AbstractCheckedFuture.java&l=84

It would actually be nice if the comment were true, but I don't know
the consequences of updating the code in AbstractFuture.
