Reduce differences between "when is the next permit available?" and "request a permit":
- Standardize the method name format.
- Standardize on returning the next available time (rather than the wait time that one of the two currently returns).
- Standardize on allowing the return value to indicate a time in the past (rather than requiring it to be a present/future time as one of the two currently does).

Also, improve tests and documentation around all this, particularly the "in the past" part.
