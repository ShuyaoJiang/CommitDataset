Remove the array copy from Fingerprint2011.hashBytes(byte[], int, int) method.

Conclusion: for hashFunctionWithOffset the improvements are visible in terms of bytes used, but also in terms of execution speed (before: 297,340; after: 173,506). Interestingly enough, there are small improvements for the hashBytes without offset version (before: 184,860; after: 164,804).
