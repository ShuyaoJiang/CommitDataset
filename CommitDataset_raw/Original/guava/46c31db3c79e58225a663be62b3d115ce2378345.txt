Upgrade GWT version to 2.8.2, plus:

Automated g4 rollback of changelist 173434289.

*** Reason for rollback ***

The bug isn't in HtmlUnit; it's in the old version of GWT (2.8.0) we were running against externally.

*** Original change description ***

Detect HtmlUnit's broken sorting, and skip our tests that depend on proper sorting, at least when running our GWT tests in the open-source build.
