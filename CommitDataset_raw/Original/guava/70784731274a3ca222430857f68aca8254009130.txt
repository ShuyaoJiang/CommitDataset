Mark DoubleMath as @GwtCompatible, allowing these methods to be used from GWT code:
- log2(double x)
- factorial(int n)
- fuzzyEquals(double a, double b, double tolerance)
- fuzzyCompare(double a, double b, double tolerance)
The other methods are marked as @GwtIncompatible due to aspects of their implementations not being GWT-compatible.
