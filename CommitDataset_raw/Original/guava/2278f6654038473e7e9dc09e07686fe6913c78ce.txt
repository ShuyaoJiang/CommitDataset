Remove some TODOs I added a while ago that probably shouldn't be TODONE.

Regarding Java 8: we'll want to minimize the code differences between the two versions of Guava, and avoiding repeating a 3 line static method doesn't really seem worth the difference.

Allowing users to specify the expected degree is in direct opposition with specifying expected edge count, since given two out of (node count, edge count, degree) you can always derive the third. Specifying node/edge count seems like the most reasonable combination, and it's what's already implemented.
