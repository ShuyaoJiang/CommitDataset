Avoid duplication of code in ImmutableValueGraph. Surprised I didn't realize this sooner :-/ the backing graph is a ValueGraph, so we can just call through. This also let's us do some other nice things:

1) Get rid of the static methods in AbstractValueGraph.
2) Get rid of the static method in AbstractGraph. That was actually for a different reason (because of ForwardingObject), but the only thing ForwardingObject did for us was forward the toString() method which we actually *don't* want.
3) Allow us to "cache" the edge value map, and have both the mutable and immutable implementations inherit that behavior. If someone is calling e.g. graph.edgeValues().get(...) in a loop this should be a noticeable improvement.
