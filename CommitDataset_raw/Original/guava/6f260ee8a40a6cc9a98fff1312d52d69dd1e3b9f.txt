Go back to avoiding AssertionError(String, Throwable), which isn't available in Gingerbread.
http://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/AssertionError.html#AssertionError%28java.lang.String,%20java.lang.Throwable%29

This rolls back CL 111609121, which AFAIK didn't break any tests but would have made broken tests run under Gingerbread throw NoSuchMethodError instead of the proper, descriptive AssertionError.

I had noted this compatibility issue previously but had dismissed it because we were not running our tests on Android at the time.
