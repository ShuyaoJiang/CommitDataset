Interrupt the producer thread instead of assuming it will exit naturally.
If the SynchronousQueue producer doesn't try to put() in time for the consumer to accept the value, it hangs forever.
The result is a flaky test.

As part of this, I've removed the producer's ability to fail the test if it's interrupted.
That's because I need to be able to interrupt the SynchronousQueue put() operation.
I could find a way to continue to fail on interrupts in other cases, but it doesn't seem valuable enough to be worth the trouble.
