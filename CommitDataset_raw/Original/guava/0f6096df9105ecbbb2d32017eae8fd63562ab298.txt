ValueGraph.edgeValue*: change from
* V edgeValue(), V edgeValueOrDefault()
to
* Optional<V> edgeValue(), V edgeValueOrNull()

Fixed Graphs.inducedSubgraph() implementations so that it appropriately specifies the # of nodes in the induced subgraph as being the size of the supplied node Iterable.

Fixed MoreGraphs.inducedSubgraph() implementations so that the filtered nodes are being returned as Lists rather than Iterators, so that calculating their size doesn't exhaust the Iterator.

Fixed the graph *Builder from() methods so that they are all uniformly enforcing types (this was causing MOE problems in conjunction with the expectedNodes() call.
