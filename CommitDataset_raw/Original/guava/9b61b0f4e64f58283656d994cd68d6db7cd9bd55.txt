For clarity, re-apply @Beta to the CharMatcher constants.

We deprecated the CharMatcher constants back when they were @Beta. Then we removed @Beta from the class. Because these methods were never present as non-@Deprecated, non-@Beta APIs, and because they are expensive to initialize on Android, we'll still remove them.

Since we're removing them, it makes sense to put our "We might remove this" annotation them. Doing so should make things clearer to humans, and it should allow tools to identify usages of these APIs to warn about possible breakages.
