Fix calls to contains(Object) and get(Object) that pass a value of apparently the wrong type.
Tighten up some generics in other cases to make the type, which was correct after all, look more correct.

BUGS:

AbstractBiMapTester:
- Fix inv.entrySet().contains(...) check, which was using the forward entry instead of the reverse.
- Fix getMap().get(v) call to be an inv.get(v) call.
- Use |reversed| instead of |entry| consistently for clarity.

TypeToken:
- Call map.get(K) instead of map.get(TypeCollector).
(Presumably this was just an optimization and not necessary for correctness?)

SIMPLIFICATIONS:

TypeResolver:
- forLookup always returns a (nullable) TypeVariableKey. Declare that return type instead of plain Object.
(benyu@: I feel like we may have talked about this, with your expressing a preference for the Object type. But I can find no record of the discussion, so I could be making that up. If you do prefer Object, I won't push for the change.)
