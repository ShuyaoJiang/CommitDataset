Remove "SetView" from all graph implementations. See [] for why it should be killed with fire. In particular, it made the returned Sets have O(N) (in both time and memory) size() and contains() methods, and in one case, O(N^2) iteration!

To facilitate this change, create "NodeConnections" to replace "IncidentEdges". This class stores not only the incident edges but also the adjacent nodes for each origin node.
