Take advantage of new GWT AbstractFuture tests to enhance overall AbstractFuture testing:
- Run the tests not just under GWT but also under "normal Java."
- Run the test as part of our open-source build (which happens mostly "automatically" as part of the above change).
- Expand the tests to run with a TrustedFuture input and a non-TrustedFuture input. Currently this matters only in non-GWT mode, but I expect that to change in time.
