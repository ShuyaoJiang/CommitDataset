Delete WellBehavedMap.

The bug it worked around was fixed in Java 7:
https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6312706

And I don't believe it was ever present under Android:
https://android.googlesource.com/platform/libcore/+/fdb2704414a9ed92394ada0d1395e4db86889465/luni/src/main/java/java/util/EnumMap.java#146

I haven't looked for the absolute first version ever of GWT, but the still very old GWT file doesn't have the bug, either.

Deleting this class will simplify some work I'm doing around our EnumMap usage for j2cl.
