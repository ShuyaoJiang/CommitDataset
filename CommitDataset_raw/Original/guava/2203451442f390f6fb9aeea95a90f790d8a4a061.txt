For constant field declarations, you should use the immutable type (such as ImmutableList) instead of the general collection interface type (such as List). This communicates to your callers important semantic guarantees.

This change replaces constants (static final CONSTNAT_CASE) declaration type which use the general collection interface (e.g. List) with an immutable type (e.g. ImmutableList).
