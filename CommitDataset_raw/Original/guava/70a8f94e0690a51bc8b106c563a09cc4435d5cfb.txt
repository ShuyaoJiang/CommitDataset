Ensure that ByteStreams.skipFully/skipUpTo don't skip more bytes than remain in the stream.

This is a horrible thing that is possible with FileInputStream in JDK7, despite that it violates the contract of InputStream.skip. The solution (which we were already doing in our method for counting a stream via skip) is to never ask to skip more bytes than the stream reports as available().

This does unfortunately change skipFully to skip by reading when the InputStream always returns 0 from available() (the default behavior if it isn't overridden), but as far as I can tell it's necessary to ensure correct behavior.

This issue is causing test failures under JDK7 with the recent change to the behavior of ByteSource.slice.
