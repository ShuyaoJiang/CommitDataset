SerializableTester.reserializeAndAssert checks that original.getClass() == copy.getClass().
Fix EmptyContiguousSet serialization using cgdecker's patch (which also removes a redundant "implements Serializable" from RegularContiguousSet).
Also, stop using reserializeAndAssert for the few instances in which the reserialized version of an object is a different class.
