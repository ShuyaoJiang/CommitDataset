Reconcile the cancellation semantics for Futures.combine, successfulAsList, allAsList, and withFallback to be consistent with Futures.transform.  Now, all cancellations are back-propagated to the input futures.  We also expose the interruption state in AbstractFuture with a protected method.  To ensure the interruption state is correct and threadsafe, we add an additional state to AbstractFuture's inner Sync class to atomically distinguish between cancelled and interrupted.
