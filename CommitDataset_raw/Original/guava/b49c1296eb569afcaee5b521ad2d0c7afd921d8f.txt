Add extensive tests for simplifyPath that aren't prefixed with /b/c.
These tests caught the "." -> "" problem (though I initially ignored it... oops) and would have caught the if->while problem raised during review.
I suspect they would also have caught the existing bugs, but I haven't yet confirmed this.
