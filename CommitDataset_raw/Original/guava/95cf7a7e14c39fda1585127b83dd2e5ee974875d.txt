It's January 2013!
- Remove MapMaker.softKeys.
- Remove AsynchronousComputationException (slated for November 2012 deletion).
- Change Unsigned* methods' expiration from a month to a version, since "one version" is what we try to do, anyway, and we had scheduled them for "January" rather than "15.0."
