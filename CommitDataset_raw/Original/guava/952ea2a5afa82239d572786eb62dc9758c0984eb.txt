Rewrite the Tld Pattern generator, take 2.
This CL adds the possibility to reuse the pattern generator for other template files. Also now the generator keeps track about which tld patterns are from the official ICANN list, and which patterns are private.
(Roll forward of CL 56906311, which was rolled back in CL 56996630, with a fix for the multiple internal-only GWT modules in com.google.common.net.)
