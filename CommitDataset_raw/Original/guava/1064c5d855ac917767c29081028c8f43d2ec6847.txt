Deprecate mutator methods on immutable/unmodifiable classes in common.collect.  It can't possibly be correct to invoke a method that mutates a collection on an immutable object and this will help catch those errors at compile time.  It also has the benefit that IDEs set up to filter deprecated methods from the auto-complete suggestions will filter out the unsupported methods.
