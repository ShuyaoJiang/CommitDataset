3 days of pent-up improvements:
- Make setException(null) throw NullPointerException instead of silently 
  setting the future to succeeded (with a result value of null).
- Remove unnecessary type parameter from transformExceptions() and its 
  implementation class.
- New ConcurrentHashMultiset factory method that takes a MapMaker. This allows 
  using soft/weak keys and expiration on the backing map.
- Turns out it's annoying to not know whether it's the key or value that was
  null in an ImmutableMap.
- Tiny javadoc fixes, mostly concerning code snippets.
- Introduce a package-private Iterables.toArray(Iterable) method as a
  GWT-compatible alternative to the public Iterables.toArray(Iterable, Class),
  and achieve a marginally more efficient implementation of the GWT emulation
  for ImmutableSet's Builder and copyOf methods.
- Make EnumBiMap and EnumHashBiMap GwtCompatible.
