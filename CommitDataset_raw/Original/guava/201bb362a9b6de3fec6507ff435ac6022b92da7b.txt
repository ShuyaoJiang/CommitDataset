Add and use helper methods like assertDone() in tests.
This found no bugs -- well, maybe one if you count the inconsistent propagation of interruption from the delegate, though I had suspected as much already.

Add another "misbehaving listener" test, this one for the case in which the Future is already done.
This found a bug, which I've fixed.
