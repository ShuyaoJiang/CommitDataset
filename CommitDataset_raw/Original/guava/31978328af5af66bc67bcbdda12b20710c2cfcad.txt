Run "normal" GWT tests in public Guava.
We still don't run the suite-builder tests, so the run is incomplete, but at least it's fairly quick:
Tests run: 6667, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 155.218 sec

Among the steps of this process covered by this CL:
- Export the generated GWTTestCase files into Guava.
- Add dependencies in guava-gwt on the guava (and guava-testlib) test sources.
- Treat the GWT portion of guava-testlib as though it is part of the guava-gwt tests (to sidestep the issue that we should really have a separate guava-testlib-gwt artifact analogous to the separate guava-gwt project). (Mainly this means putting its files under guava-gwt/tests.)
