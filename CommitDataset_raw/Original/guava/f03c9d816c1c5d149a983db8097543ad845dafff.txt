Use the renamingDecorator to ensure that Services always run in appropriately named threads.

AbstractIdleService and AbstractScheduledService encode the current state in the name so you should see something like

MyService (STARTING|RUNNING|STOPPING)

AbstractExecutionThread service just uses the serviceName() (so it would be "MyService")  I could additionally try to encode the state but it didn't seem worth it.
