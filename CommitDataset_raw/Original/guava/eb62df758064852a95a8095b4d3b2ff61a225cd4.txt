Optimize directed graphs to consume less memory, at the cost of additional code complexity. Some very rough benchmarks also seem to indicate this has slightly faster runtime. I suspect this is due to improved cache performance/locality when using a single Map.

Memory: Directed mutable graphs consume less memory across the board, with graphs of small degree benefiting the most (memory consumption around 75% of previous). Directed immutable graph memory consumption is more of a wash - going down slightly for graphs of small degree and up for graphs of large degree.

Runtime: Adding a few million edges seems to be about 10% faster.
