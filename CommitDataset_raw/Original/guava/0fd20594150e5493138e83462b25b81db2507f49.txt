Move the the static constant empty iterator to live in its implementation class, ArrayItr.

This removes the only static constant field from c.g.c.c.Iterators, which allows ProGuard to eliminate it and move its methods to another common location.  Additionally, if we don't reference emptyIterator() or forArray(...) in future, we'll eliminate ArrayItr too.
