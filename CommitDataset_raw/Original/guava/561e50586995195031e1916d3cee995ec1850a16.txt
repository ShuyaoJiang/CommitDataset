Make MapTestSuiteBuilder (also BiMapTestSuiteBuilder) work under GWT, and then use it there (as well as the non-GWT ImmutableSortedMapTest, where it should have been used already).

This primarily involves making more derived suites (e.g., keySet(), values(), entrySet()) work under GWT.
The GWT test suites are produced with code generation, so, in order to work under GWT, a derived suite must be recognized by GwtTestSuiteGenerator so that we know how to generate code for it.
I've generalized the existing DerivedTestIteratorGenerator support to support any DerivedGenerator (each of which should have a one-arg constructor accepting its inner generator as an argument).

Now that we run MapTestSuiteBuilder tests, we can remove the individual, manually generated "derived" test suites.

The MapTestSuiteBuilder tests did encounter a couple problems:
- I had to move NullsBeforeB from MultisetCollectionTest to Helpers so that it could be used more widely (for reasons that its Javadoc hopefully makes clear).  (This was a problem in the test, not the production code.)
- I had to support null queries in the GWT ImmutableSortedMap.  (While I was there, I also prevented us from double-wrapping any submaps with unmodifiableSortedSet, since we know that the original map was already unmodifiable.  This is a tiny optimization.)  The null-query behavior was a "bug," albeit a very small one.
