Extracted FreshValueGenerator from ForwardingWrapperTester to a stand-alone class so it can be reused for automated equals testing.

Fixed a bug in freshCurrency() because apparently no all Locale's can be passed to Currency.getInstance().

Also added Parameter.getInvokable(). I find that not having it forces me to pass around the Invokable together with the Parameter, which is inconvenient. And the backward reference isn't unprecedented, Method.getDeclaringClass() does it too.
