Provide ExecutorService decorators that will rename the threads in which its tasks run for the duration of the task.

Open issues:
1. should any of these be public?  Currently I am only planning on using them for some of the Service base classes so package private is fine, but we may want to make them public.
2. I needed/wanted to use WrappingExecutorService but it was marked GoogleInternal, so i removed @GoogleInternal.  Is this ok? or should i use a similar private class? moe-strip public from it?
