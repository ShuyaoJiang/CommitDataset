Fix after rollback changelist 84974387.

Added documentation and test that SerializingExecutor ignores interrupts,
since javatests/com/google/apps/framework/concurrent/ListenableStreamTest.java assumes
that should be the case.

I am not convinced that this is correct because it effectively disables the normal mechanism for shutting down an executor.

*** Original change description ***

Add some functionality to SerializingExecutor and rework its code.

Add functionality to suspend the execution. Intended primarily for cases where we want to wait
for an rpc before continuing execution....
