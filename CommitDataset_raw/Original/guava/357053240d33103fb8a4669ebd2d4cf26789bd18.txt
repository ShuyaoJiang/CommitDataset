Make GwtPlatform available to server-side applications.
It's not actually used there, but dev mode clients do use it, and it won't be available to them unless it's compiled by javac as part of our GWT targets.

One complication: The obvious way of doing this requires the server-side code to depend on the GWT target containing @GwtScriptOnly.
This might be OK (though we'd have to check with at least one project, whose tests flag the new dependency), but it turns out to be unnecessary:
@GwtScriptOnly has an effect only on the supersource class (which makes sense, since it's the supersource version that's the one being used in JavaScript only -- the GwtPlatform files I'm editing here are more like @UseThisInsteadIfNotGwtScript).
Thus, I can remove it from these versions of GwtPlatform.
