Remove the "? super" from the return type of the nodeOrder/edgeOrder methods. It doesn't actually provide any additional functionality for the user, just a mild annoyance. Also this is in line with the recommendation here:

In partiular:

"In return types

Avoid using wildcards in return types and constants. You should almost never need to do this, and it puts a burden on the user."
