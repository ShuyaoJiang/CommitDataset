Update javadoc. The previous sample code was not actually doing what the comment describes. In particular, it was calling adjacentNodes() instead of successors(). The comment says "all nodes reachable from node", but adjacentNodes() will also travel AGAINST the direction of the edge (not necessarily "reachable" in the directed case).
