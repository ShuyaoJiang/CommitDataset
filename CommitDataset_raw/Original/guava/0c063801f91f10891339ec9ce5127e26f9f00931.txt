Fix 6-year-old test bug.

The bug is:

  try {
    somethingThatShouldFail();
    fail();
  } catch (AssertionFailedError expected) {
  }

The fail() is masked by the catch() block.
I've requested an enhancement to Error Prone to catch this: https://github.com/google/error-prone/issues/393

Additionally, I improved IteratorTester under GWT: IteratorTester couldn't catch wrong-exception bugs there because of GWT's lack of reflection. This was a known, documented limitation, but the tests still attempted to verify its ability to do so. When I fixed the test bug, they broke. I then realized that I could just fix IteratorTester to work under GWT. It's probably even a simplification.

Tested:
global TAP
