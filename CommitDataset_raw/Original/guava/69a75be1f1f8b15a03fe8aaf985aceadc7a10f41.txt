Reformat much of util.concurrent.

I squeezed in a few other changes:
- for (;;) => while (true), since our formatting rules require(?) weird formatting for the former
- removal of some "@throws NullPointerException if x is null" clauses, since that is our default policy
- adding {} to some if() statements or loops or something
- maybe other things I forgot?
