Add ByteStreams.readBytes(InputStream, ByteProcessor). It was requested by a Guava user and I actually already added the equivalent to CharStreams for LineProcessor. It also is a case where we should provide an InputStream equivalent so that users don't create single use InputSuppliers/ByteSources.

Also add a missing @since tag and fix a few line lengths.
