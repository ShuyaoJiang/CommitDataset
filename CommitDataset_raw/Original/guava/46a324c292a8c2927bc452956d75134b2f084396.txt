Avoid mentioning ImmutableSortedMap in the ImmutableMap implementation.

I'm not sure why ProGuard couldn't strip this out already, but ImmutableSortedMap and several of *its* dependencies were getting retained when ProGuard stripped ImmutableMap, and this fixes it.

Effects on ImmutableMapProGuard: ([]87770 bytes => 59284 bytes
93 classes => 64 classes
601 methods => 363 methods
