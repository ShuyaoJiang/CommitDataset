@since tweaks:
- ForwardingSet.standardRemoveAll is an override of ForwardingCollection.standardRemoveAll, so, as binary compatibility goes, it "inherits" @since 7.0 from its parent.  Still, it's good document what we changed.
- ImmutableSortedMap changed to implement NavigableMap.  That seems worth documenting.
