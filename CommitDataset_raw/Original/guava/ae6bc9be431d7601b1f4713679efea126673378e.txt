- Move close of <pre>{@code} blocks (i.e. "}</pre>") that are on a separate line up to the last line of the block contents, eliminating an extra blank line between the pre block and what follows.
- Change a number of <pre> blocks to <pre>{@code} blocks.
- Remove @Override from methods inside several <pre>{@code} blocks. When they're preceded by a {, they cause javadoc to screw up by thinking they're an invalid javadoc tag, even though it doesn't interpret tags inside {@code} blocks....
