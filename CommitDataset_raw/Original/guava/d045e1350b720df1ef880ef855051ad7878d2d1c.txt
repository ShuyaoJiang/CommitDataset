Move c.g.c.collect.testing.GwtPlatform to guava-gwt.
Eventually it may end up in a new guava-testlib-gwt.
For the moment, though, let's just get it out of guava-testlib so that we don't need a GWT dependency there.
This CL also removes that dependency.

I've edited the MOE config to emphasize putting GWT stuff in guava-gwt over all other priorities.
This moves some .gwt.xml files, which likewise would live in a guava-testlib-gwt area.
It makes a special case for Testing.gwt.xml irrelevant, so I've removed it, though we'll want an analogous special case in a guava-testlib-gwt future.

This CL also adds missing JUnit inherits.
