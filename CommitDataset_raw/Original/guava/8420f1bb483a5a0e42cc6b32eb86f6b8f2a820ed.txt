Eliminate references to ImmutableAsList in ImmutableMultiset.

ImmutableMultiset, for once, doesn't have a specialized asList(), so this does the right thing on both server side and Android: on Java 7, it returns a normal ImmutableList, on server-side it returns an ImmutableList whose contains() method delegates to the backing ImmutableMultiset.

80423 bytes => 78313 bytes
34 classes => 31 classes
257 methods => 240 methods
