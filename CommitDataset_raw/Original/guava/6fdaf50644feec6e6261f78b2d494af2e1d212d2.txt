Add a new HostAndPort.fromHost() factory, which behaves like fromParts()
without the port number.  This is useful for converting a host into
possibly-bracketed form, so that a port may be appended afterward.

Also, the correct buffer size is "length + 8", due to the 5-digit port,
two brackets, and a colon.
