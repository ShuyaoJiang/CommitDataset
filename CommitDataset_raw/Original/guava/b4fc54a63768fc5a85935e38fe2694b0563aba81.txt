In 4 files, manually include a TestCase in its own suite().
This lets the open-source build run those tests.

Details: Our internal test runner, given a TestCase with a suite() method, always runs the TestCase in addition to the suite(), even if the suite() doesn't include it.
The external Maven test runner, by contrast, skips the TestCase itself unless the suite() includes it.
That's led us to add the suite manually: https://github.com/google/guava/blob/fac8339c87815fb7deca0cf01d61a5146355723f/guava-tests/test/com/google/common/collect/SetsTest.java#L116
But we missed it in a few recent cases.

I noticed one of these cases when I ran the open-source GWT tests and they failed (because we're using an old Truth version externally, which I'm also fixing).
This raised the question of why the non-GWT tests weren't failing in the same way, and the answer is that this suite() business was skipping them.
I identified other affected tests with:

$ grep -rl '^  public static Test suite[(][)]' */test/ > /tmp/files
$ grep '^  public void test' -l $(for F in `cat /tmp/files`; do BASE=$(basename $F .java); grep "addTestSuite($BASE.class)" -L $F; done)

Note that, with this solution, we run the tests *twice* internally.
This is unfortunate but probably livable.
An alternative that we've employed is to move the tests into a nested class, which we then don't need to add to the suite:
https://github.com/google/guava/blob/fac8339c87815fb7deca0cf01d61a5146355723f/guava-tests/test/com/google/common/collect/ImmutableListTest.java#L127
That way, we run the test only once internally.
The downside is that we don't run it externally at all :(
I should fix the external problem for the existing tests, but that's a problem for another CL (CL 157852006, pending).

Another alternative is to move all our suites out of the main test files.
This is possibly a good idea, anyway, as it's a prerequisite for running the suites under GWT and Android, which would have caught problems like []But again, one thing at a time...
