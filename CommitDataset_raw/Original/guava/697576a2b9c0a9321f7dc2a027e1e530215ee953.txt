Add the most basic portion of our testing infrastructure required to make the Guava tests pass, and add a replacement for Assert.* so we can have the assertions available to the tests in this core library, without forcing a dependency on JUnit or any other testing framework.  The tests, themselves, of course, can remain dependent on JUnit.
