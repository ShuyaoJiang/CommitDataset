Some changes to the Guava README.

Move most information about the latest release to the release badge at the top, which now links to the GitHub release page for the latest release and automatically displays the latest release version number.

Note: I probably would have removed explicit references to the latest version number entirely (meaning no changes to it need to be made when a new release is created) except for the fact that the release process currently relies on there being *some* change made when prepare_release is run so that the release script knows what commit to create the release from. There are ways we could deal with that, but I didn't want to deal with that yet.
