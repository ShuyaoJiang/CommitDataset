Use J2ObjC's @RetainedWith annotation instead of @Weak on ImmutableMap.keySet
to prevent crashes on iOS.

TESTED=Created a map inside a autorelease pool and saved a reference to the
keyset. Checked that the keyset functions correctly outside the autorelease
pool. Checked that both the keyset and the map are deallocated by the
autorelease pool when not holding a reference to the keyset. Did this test with
both ImmutableMap.of(<2 entries>) and ImmutableBiMap.of(<2 entries>).

RELNOTES=J2ObjC: Fixes crashes from use of `ImmutableMap.keySet()`.
