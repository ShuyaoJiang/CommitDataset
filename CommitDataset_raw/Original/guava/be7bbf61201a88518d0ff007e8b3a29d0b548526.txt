*** Reason for rollback ***

Removing the rest of the .gwt.xml references to java.* breaks open-source compilation of files like Suppliers, so Suppliers probably needs the java.* references; it just happens to be getting them now from other targets also on the classpath.

*** Original change description ***

Cleanup unnecessary gwt.xml's from c/g/common/base and c/g/common/collect.
