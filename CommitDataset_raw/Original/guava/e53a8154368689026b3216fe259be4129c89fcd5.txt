Make a couple of optimizations to UnsignedLongs.toString(x, radix):

* If x > 0, use Long.toString. The JDK code is essentially the same for radices other than 10, and is much faster for 10.

* If radix is a power of two, use shifting and masking instead of division and remainder.

* If radix is even, simplify the initial division that extracts the last digit.
