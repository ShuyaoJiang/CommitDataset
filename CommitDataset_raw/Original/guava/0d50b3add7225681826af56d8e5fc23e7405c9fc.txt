Fix https://github.com/google/guava/issues/1982 by adding some preconditions

The error behavior isn't really changing, since it would still fail, it is just
that now it will fail slightly sooner and the stack trace when it does will
point to the users buggy scheduler() method, which i believe is all the bug was
asking for.
