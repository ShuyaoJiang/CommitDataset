MOE stripping fixes:
- Put "MOE:{begin,end}_intracomment_strip" in HTML comments so that it does not appear in internal Javadoc.
- Turn scrub_sensitive_comments off so that MOE gives errors instead of silently stripping comments that contained sensitive words.
- Where necessary, manually strip out sensitive words, remove them, or replace them with non-sensitive words.
