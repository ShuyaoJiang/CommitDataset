Add a state transition listening mechanism to Service and implement in AbstractService.

This is the first of several CLs that will change the Service interface. The basic plan is:
1. add the listener interface (this cl)
2. add some utility methods for doing timed waits via the listener apis.
3. migrate users of start() and stop() to void versions of those methods.
