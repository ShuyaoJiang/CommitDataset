Delete the existing Hypergraph interface. We're pretty much 100% sure this is not where we want it in the interface hierarchy, and leaving it there as a public interface isn't helping anyone.

Also, remove references to "hyperedges" and "hypergraphs" in the javadoc/g3doc. No proposal that we're considering will Graph/Network support hyperedges.
