Suppress new CollectionIncompatibleType Error Prone check by casting
incompatibly-typed argument to query methods in generic collection types.
This will enable us to make this pattern an error in [], preventing
future occurrences of this bug.

REVIEWERS TAKE NOTE: We are *not* fixing this bug.  Fixing it requires making
a behavioral change, and we need your team to assume any risks associated
with that. Please approve this CL, so we can enable the new compiler error
and prevent future occurrences of this bug.

Background:

Various generic collection types have methods that take Object rather than the type parameter you would expect, e.g. Collection#contains. Consider a
Collection<String>.  If someone invokes contains() on that collection and
passes in an argument of type Integer, it can never return true because the
Collection cannot contain any Integers.

This CL changes places where these methods are called with an incompatible
type by casting the argument to the declared type of the method, such as
Object or Collection<?>.  **This does not fix the bug.**  It is
semantically-equivalent code that bypasses the Error Prone check so that the
code will continue to compile after we enable the check in the compiler.
Fixing the bug mechanically is not feasible because the fixes are too complex,
but we want to prevent more instances of this bug from entering the codebase.
