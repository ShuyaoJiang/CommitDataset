Automated (partial) g4 rollback of changelist 100047098.
(only the testlib parts, and excluding UnmodifiableCollectionTests, where we still need a workaround for Android's toArray() bug)

*** Reason for rollback ***

No longer a problem now that we put test infrastructure in a separate dex (CL 100842219) and suppress searching for tests in that dex (CL 100849889).

*** Original change description ***

Spray @SuppressUnderAndroid on everything related to suite builders and nested test classes.
Also:
- Work around Android toArray() bug in UnmodifiableCollectionTests.
- Stop referring to NavigableMapTestSuiteBuilder / ListTestSuiteBuilder in comments of ForwardingNavigableMapTest.java / ListsTest.java. The reference impedes the import stripper.
