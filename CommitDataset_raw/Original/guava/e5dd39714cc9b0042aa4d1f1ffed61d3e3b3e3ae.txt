Avoid referencing any Ordering methods except natural() in ImmutableSortedSet.

This is a behavior change, but kevinb@ and I agreed that this shouldn't really be detectable -- the handful of users of SortedSet.comparator() don't seem likely to actually do much introspecting on the comparator, and the comparator is equivalent, just no longer an Ordering.

Effects on ImmutableSortedSetProGuard:
81478 bytes => 78328 bytes
32 classes => 29 classes
307 methods => 287 methods
