Miscellanous followup to CL 177814345:

- Make inverse() thread-safe in the mainline, as it is in the backport.
- Remove an inaccurate comment: http://[]
- Eliminate a couple spurious diffs between branches. (That said, if you don't want @RetainedWith in the java7 branch, I don't mind keeping it out. I just happened to notice it.)
