Fix documentation for checkArgument and checkState

Both claim

@throws NullPointerException if the check fails and either {@code
errorMessageTemplate} or {@code errorMessageArgs} is null (don't let this
happen)

but this doesn't actually happen - the message is created using
Precondition.format that handles null values without throwing.

This is more of a concern for the "don't let Args be null" because having
potential null args is in fact a legitimate usecase.
