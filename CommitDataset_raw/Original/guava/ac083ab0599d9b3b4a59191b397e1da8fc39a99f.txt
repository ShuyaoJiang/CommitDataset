Removes @WeakOuter from AggregateFuture.RunningState and subclasses. The weak
outer reference causes a dangling pointer if the RunningState outlives its
Future. Furthermore, the @WeakOuter wasn't necessary to maintain leak-free
behavior because AggregateFuture nulls it's runningState reference in
afterDone().
