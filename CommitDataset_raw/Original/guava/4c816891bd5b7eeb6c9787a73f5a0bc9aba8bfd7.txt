More safety checks when adding and removing edges, plus simplify the code. Rather than return a boolean, addEdge now asserts that it *always* add an edge (we avoid calling it at all if it wouldn't). Similarly for removing edges, removeEdge() now asserts that it always removes an edge - unless the graph is undirected and it's a self-loop edge.
