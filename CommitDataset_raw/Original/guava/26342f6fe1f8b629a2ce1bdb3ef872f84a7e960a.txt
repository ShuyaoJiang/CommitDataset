Work around a type inference change in javac

The javac compiler's behavior when handling wildcards and "capture" type
variables has been improved for conformance to the language specification. This
improves type checking behavior in certain unusual circumstances. It is also a
source-incompatible change: certain uses of wildcards that have compiled in the
past may fail to compile because of a program's reliance on the javac bug.
