Added default-value auto generation to NullPointerTester, for interfaces (and
got rid of the manual registration of Function, Predicate and BinaryPredicate).

went ahead and just made it @Beta and apache and everything. If we don't think
it's worth releasing, I can move it to the common/testing package and make it
package-private.
