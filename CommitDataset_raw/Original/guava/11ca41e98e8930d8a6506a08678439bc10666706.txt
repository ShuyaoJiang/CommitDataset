Changed NullPointerTester to test inherited methods.

We only cover inherited methods from superclasses of the same package. This is
because we don't want to step into classes the author doesn't own.

For example, one may inherit from AbstractList, even though
AbstractList#equals() doesn't use @Nullable.

While for classes of the same package, we consider moving a method from subclass
to superclass a refactoring with no behavioral change. We don't want to silently
lose coverage just because of a "extract to superclass" refactoring.

Also, remove @GoogleInternal from getPackageName.
