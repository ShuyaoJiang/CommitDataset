Add a first pass to InetAddresses.forString() that validates the
characters, and decides which address family's parser to call.

Rewrite textToNumericFormatV6 so that it allocates fewer temporary
strings, and correctly rejects IPv6 addresses like "0:1:2:3::4:5:6:7".

Also remove some validation from parseOctet/parseHextet, because
that's now handled by the first pass.
