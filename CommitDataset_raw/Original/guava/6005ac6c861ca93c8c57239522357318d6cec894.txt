Added null check from NullPointerTester-generated proxies.

It should be reasonable for the follow method to check null through a collaborator:

public void foo(String a, RejectNull b) {
b.rejectNull(a);
}

interface RejectNull {
void rejectNull(String s);
}

Because RejectNull *should* throw NPE by contract.

If NPT generates this proxy, it should make sure the proxy checks nulls mandated by the method signature.
