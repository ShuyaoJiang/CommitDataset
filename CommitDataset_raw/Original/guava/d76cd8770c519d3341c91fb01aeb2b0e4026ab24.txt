Automated g4 rollback of changelist 105235264.

*** Reason for rollback ***

It turns out this doesn't fix the Guava issue. As such, I think it's probably preferable to keep the count != 0 check as it prevents unnecessary work when there are no entries in the segment. I have another fix in progress that seems to work.

*** Original change description ***

Attempt to address https://github.com/google/guava/issues/2131 by removing the if (count != 0) check.
