Disable some tests externally until GWT releases a version with the problematic bug fixed.

The tests work fine in non-GWT mode, but we don't have a trivial way to say "run this everywhere except externally under GWT," so I'm just stripping them entirely.
(In particular, I don't think "// MOE:insert @GwtIncompatible" works because we would stil generate a StreamsTest_gwt that refers to the removed methods, so it would fail to compile.)
This ensures that we still run them internally in both modes, which seems more important than running them internally+externally but never under GWT (as @GwtIncompatible would do).
