*** Original change description ***

Make common.reflect build and pass tests against both Java 7 and Java 8.

In particular, Java 7 had both the TypeVariable and AnnotatedElement interfaces, which were unrelated.  In Java 8, TypeVariable extends AnnotatedElement, and gained a method getAnnotatedBounds(), returning an AnnotatedType[], where AnnotatedType was an interface introduced in Java 8...
