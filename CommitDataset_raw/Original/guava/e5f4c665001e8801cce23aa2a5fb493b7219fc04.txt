Optimize PairedStatsAccumulator.addAll(PairedStats). If we update the xStats before we update sumOfProductsOfDeltas, instead of after, so that we use the new value of (values.xStats().mean() - xStats.mean()) instead of the old value, then we absorb two of the factors in the product, and save ourselves a multiplication and a division.

This seems like a straight win, and also makes the code look more like that in the add(double, double) method.
