Add @CheckReturnValue to the com.google.common.util.concurrent package. This forces the caller of these APIs to "do something" with the result of the call.

If you want to use transform() to perform an action on a successful Future without returning a result, use addCallback(). (addCallback() brings the added bonus that any exceptions will be logged.)
Similarly, if you want to use catching() to perform an action on a failed Future without return a result, use addCallback().
