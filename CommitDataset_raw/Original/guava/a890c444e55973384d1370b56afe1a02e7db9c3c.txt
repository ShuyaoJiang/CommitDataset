Annotate checkNotNull's input and output as @NonNull.

We don't want to go down the road of annotating most things @NonNull, as we eventually want to use tools that assume that that's the default. However, it's pretty weird for checkNotNull() to return a @Nullable value in the minds of some tools, so let's annotate just that method and see how it goes.
