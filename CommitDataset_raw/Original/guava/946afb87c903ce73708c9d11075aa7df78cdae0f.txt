Print the actual output of failed tests.

Luckily, last time I was able to guess at the cause specifically because it was an "error" and not a "failure."
And typically we'd be able to reproduce the failure by running locally, though I'm not sure if that's the case here because it depends on test ordering... which is currently dependent on the filesytem's order of files, but I'll deal with that in a separate CL.

This appears to be the best solution: https://stackoverflow.com/a/19685036/28465
