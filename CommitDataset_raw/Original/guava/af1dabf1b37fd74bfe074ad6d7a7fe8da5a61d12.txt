NullPointerTester should not require @Nullable on the param of an equals() override

This is currently being worked around with things like:

new NullPointerTester()
    .ignore(AutoValue_MyValueType.class.getMethod("equals", Object.class))
    ...

The work-arounds prevent AutoValue from being treated as a pure implementation-generating processor.

Fixes #1819
