Add a direct dependency from guava-gwt to checker-qual.

The GWT sources (specifically, GwtSerializationDependencies) use @Nullable directly, so we shouldn't rely on relying on it indirectly through guava-jre.

However, what actually prompted this is a strange behavior in Compile-Testing, which Truth uses. This CL should help, though it might not be a fully solution.
