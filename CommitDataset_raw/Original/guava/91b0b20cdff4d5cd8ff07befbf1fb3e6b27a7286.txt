Fix the serialization of sparse immutable tables.

The 'cellColumnIndices' fields of DenseImmutableTable and SparseImmutableTable
appeared to serve the same purpose, but were actually slightly different. This
broke serialization of sparse immutable tables. Additionally, our serialization
tests did not cover sparse immutable tables.

Rename the SparseImmutableTable field for clarity, and add tests covering
sparse immutable tables.
