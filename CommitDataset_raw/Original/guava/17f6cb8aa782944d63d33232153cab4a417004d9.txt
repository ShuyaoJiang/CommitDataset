Extracted part of NullPointerTester and Stub into NullValues;
Added code to call default constructor if all else failed;

Some potential incompatibility from previous version:
1. Use ImmutableList.of() in place of Collections.emptyList(), ImmutableSet.of() in place of Collections.emptySet(). I don't anticipate issues here.
2. Use ImmutableSortedSet.of() in place of new TreeSet(). mutable -> immutable.
3. Use a Comparator that always returns 0, instead of reverseOrder() which requires T extends Comparable.

If this sounds reasonable, I'll send it through global TAP queue to make sure it doesn't break builds.
