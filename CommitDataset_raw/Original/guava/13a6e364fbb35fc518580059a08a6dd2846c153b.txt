Don't construct thousands of strings.

Test timings aren't 100% consistent, even when I run the Maven tests locally (rather than the internal tests in some random cluster), so don't take this as definite truth, but I'm seeing some apparent improvements from this CL, even after my earlier CL to decrease the iteration count. Here are the numbers for all tests to take >=10 seconds:

Before:
00:11 testCorrectOrdering_smallHeapsPollFirst
00:11 testCorrectOrdering_smallHeapsPollLast
00:16 testHeapIntact
00:17 testRandomAddsAndRemoves_duplicateElements
00:19 testRemoveAt
00:25 testRandomAddsAndRemoves
00:48 testCorrectOrdering_mediumHeapsPollFirst
00:52 testCorrectOrdering_mediumHeapsPollLast
02:02 testCorrectOrdering_randomAccess

After:
00:08 testCorrectOrdering_smallHeapsPollFirst
00:08 testCorrectOrdering_smallHeapsPollLast
00:15 testHeapIntact
00:17 testRandomAddsAndRemoves_duplicateElements
00:18 testRemoveAt
00:27 testRandomAddsAndRemoves
00:46 testCorrectOrdering_mediumHeapsPollLast
00:50 testCorrectOrdering_mediumHeapsPollFirst
01:14 testCorrectOrdering_randomAccess
