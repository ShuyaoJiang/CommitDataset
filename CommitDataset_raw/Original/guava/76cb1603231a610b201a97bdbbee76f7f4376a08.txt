GWT/Guava maintenance:
- Rename com.google.common.collect.testing.testing-gwt to com.google.common.collect.testing.Testing, and actually use the existing Testing.gwt.xml file.
- Annotate classes with @GwtCompatible.
- Open-source GWT files.
- Stop stripping some GWT modules that have since become open-sourced.
