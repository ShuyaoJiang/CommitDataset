The fact that ClassPath does a lot of I/O in its creation makes the two added methods unnecessarily expensive.  They still make sense, but perhaps not on this class.

Rollback: Update ClassPath to expose the URIs that comprise the classpath.  Also add an asClassPathString method that lets you quickly go from ClassLoader to a classpath suitable for Java's -classpath flag.
