Update open-source Guava to Truth 0.13, and tighten up tests from allOf->exactly and allFrom->exactlyAs.

I started with an unconditional textual substitution.
Then I went back and reverted false positives: EnumSet.allOf, EnumFilter.allOf, Matchers.allOf, IterablesTest.testSkip_allOf*.
Then I reverted any tests that failed (all of which looked like they ought indeed to stay as allOf/allFrom.)
I gave all the remaining automated changes a sanity check, and they all passed.
