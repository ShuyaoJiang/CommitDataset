Test no-arg get() on pending Futures, even in a non-GWT setting.
To prevent from hanging forever, of course, we need to spin up another thread to make the call.
Conveniently, we already have the code for this lying around. The main thing I did to it was change it to call getUninterruptibly, since we handling interrupts isn't worth the trouble here.
