In open-source Guava, completely skip trying to discover pluggable PatternCompiler implementations.

It's never been possible to create such implementations externally, anyway, and users are now seeing problems running the useless discovery code under the module system.

Fixes https://github.com/google/guava/issues/3147

RELNOTES=`base`: Fixed the `ServiceConfigurationError` that some users encountered when using Guava as a JPMS module.
