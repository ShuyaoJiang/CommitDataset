GWT: Better error checking, logging, and documentation.
- Error checking: I had been trying to enable compilation with -strict (<https://gist.github.com/Abdennebi/2828230>). However, while the GWT compiler parameter is "-strict" and the Maven system property is "gwt.compiler.strict," the Maven parameter is "failOnError:" <http://mojo.codehaus.org/gwt-maven-plugin/compile-mojo.html#failOnError>. Additionally, while the compilation goal supports failOnError, the test goal does not: <http://mojo.codehaus.org/gwt-maven-plugin/test-mojo.html>. Maven had been ignoring the unrecognized names.
- Logging: Turn up the logLevel to make any future problems easier to diagnose.
- Documentation: Explain the presence of some scary "Ignored 53 units with compilation errors" warnings.
