Rewrite ImmutableSortedMultiset.Builder on Android to avoid using TreeMultiset, which allocates a ton of objects and also uses a ton of code.

The strategy we use is a little modified from how we changed ImmutableSortedMap: on every expansion, we sort and deduplicate the elements that have been added to the builder.

(modest reduction in bytes allocated, significant reduction in objects allocated, significant constant factor increase)

Effects on ImmutableSortedMultisetProGuard:
142818 bytes => 110301 bytes
86 classes => 58 classes
702 methods => 498 methods
