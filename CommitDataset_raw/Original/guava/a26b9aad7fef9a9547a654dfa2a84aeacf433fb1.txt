Make all "Tester" classes *end* with "Tester," and simplify our exclusions accordingly.

(We might be able to fully switch to glob-based .java includes/excludes now, rather than regex-based .class includes/excludes, but .class makes more sense, since Maven is really looking for classes, not source files, and I don't really feel like running the tests yet more times to make sure that I didn't accidentally exclude something new.)
