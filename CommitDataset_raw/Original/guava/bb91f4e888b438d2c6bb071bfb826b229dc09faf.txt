A rewrite of Monitor internals.
- use a linked list of active guards instead of an ArrayList
- never signal next waiter while this thread still counted in active guards
- optimize away excess signals
- other stuff rewritten to Martin's taste

Like lukes, I got bitten by the Improve Monitor bug, in part
also as a learning experience.

This class really needs more tests.

I got carried away, and now have a new appreciation for how
hard it is to get this kind of code correct.
