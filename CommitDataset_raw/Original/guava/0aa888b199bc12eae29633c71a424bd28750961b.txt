Fix the logging in Futures.CombinedFuture such that:

1. Errors are always logged (even if they were put into the output future)
2. If allMustSucceed is true then all failures after the first are logged
3. if allMustSucceed is false then all failures are not logged.

In the prior implementation (except for in rare races) exceptions were only logged if allMustSucceed was false.
