Rollback gwt.xml change.

*** Reason for rollback ***

Breaks compilation under --check_constraints=gwt, perhaps other settings?

*** Original change description ***

Make java_and_gwt_library support extra_module_contents, even though java_library doesn't :)
This lets us remove our manually maintained (and often wrong) .gwt.xml files.
Occasionally we still need an extra_module_contents file, and we should someday figure out why.
(Note: Because java_and_gwt_library has access to information that plain java_library does not, it can actually be a bit smarter about what it puts in the .gwt.xml automatically.)
The net effect on the GWT modules themselves is mostl
