google-java-format MOST OF THE THINGS.

The only things I did were:
- fixed "lists" in StringUtil and NullPointerTesterTest
- fixed a few files that needed string wrapping: WhitespaceMatcherBenchmark, SourceSinkTester, FuturesTest
- added some missing braces for for() loops in ListsTest
- removed `static` from interfaces in TypeTokenSubtypeTest and TypeTokenTest
- added blank lines between methods in ListsImplTest, CharStreamsTest, UnsignedInts, UnsignedLongs, Lists (b/26486965)
- added blank lines between copyright and package in ImmutableEnumMap, ImmutableRangeSet, TestSortedSetGenerator, SubscriberExceptionContext, SubscriberExceptionHandler, ServiceManager, WrappingScheduledExecutorService, MapsCollectionTest, ServiceManagerTest (b/28398622)
- removed blank lines inside a method call in IntMathTest and LongMathTest (b/70148121)
