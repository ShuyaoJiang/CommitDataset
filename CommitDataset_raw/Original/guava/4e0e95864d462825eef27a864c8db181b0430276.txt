When \FFFE, \FFFF, or ASCII control characters are found in the input, replace them with \FFFD.
The behavior prior to this CL is to include them in the output (for \FFFE and \FFFF) or to strip them (for ASCII control characters).
The characters are not valid in XML: http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/#charsets
