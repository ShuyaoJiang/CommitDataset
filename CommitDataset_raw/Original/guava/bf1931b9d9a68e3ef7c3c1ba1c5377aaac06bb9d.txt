Stop using `forward.new InverseEntrySet()` because javac9 generates Objects.requireNonNull() calls for it.

That method isn't available under old versions of Android.

Internally, [] eliminates these when targeting Java 6 (b/32446315). Another reason to build with Bazel someday?

No effect on Proguard numbers.
