Replace meaningful Javadoc with GWT-emulation boilerplate.

I have two main reasons for this:
1. Meaningful Javadoc is sure to get out of sync between the two versions.
2. Boilerplate helps to distinguish the two in searches, e.g., http://jsearch.[]/search?jq=immutablecollection

There's also the implicit third reason "We do it this way in the other classes." If we instead want to include real Javadoc, it would be nice to do so consistently.
