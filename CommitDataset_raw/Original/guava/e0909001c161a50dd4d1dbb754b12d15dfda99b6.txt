Change ByteSource.concat and CharSource.concat to not blow up on infinite Iterables. This also helps users whose Iterables actually eagerly load data to create sources when iterated, though ideally they shouldn't be doing that.

Also fix some javadoc formatting and suppress a couple "possible heap pollution" warnings.
