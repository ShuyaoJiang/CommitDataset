Give MapMaker the same workaround as Cache for Android's concurrency-unsafe toArray() implementation.
The fixes the corresponding Android test for MapMaker.
Also, use that implementation for values() (for which we have no test, but it looks likely to be vulnerable, too).
Finally, include an android.com link in case the shutdown of Google Code invalidates the existing bug link.
