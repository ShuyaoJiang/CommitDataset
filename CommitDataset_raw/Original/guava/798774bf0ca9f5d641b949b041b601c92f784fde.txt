Use compact data structures in ImmutableMultimap builders.

Yes, this hurts code size, we want to know how much.  It does improve allocations incurred in creating ImmutableMultimaps.

Effects on ImmutableListMultimapProGuard:
61163 bytes => 71554 bytes
52 classes => 61 classes
409 methods => 465 methods

Effects on ImmutableSetMultimapProGuard:
82739 bytes => 97853 bytes
69 classes => 80 classes
560 methods => 641 methods
