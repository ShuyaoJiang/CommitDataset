Remove a couple of APIs scheduled for removal in January 2018.

For other APIs scheduled for removal, give them a stay of execution until April so their existing usages can be cleaned up. Also update a few methods that were scheduled for removal in February to April, since we won't be doing @Beta removals in February.

ALSO update the java7 version of TreeTraveserTest to match changes that were made at some point in the past to the mainline version but not merged.

RELNOTES:
  - `collect`: Removed `BinaryTreeTraverser`.
  - `concurrent`: Removed `Futures#dereference` and `MoreExecutors#sequentialExecutor`.
