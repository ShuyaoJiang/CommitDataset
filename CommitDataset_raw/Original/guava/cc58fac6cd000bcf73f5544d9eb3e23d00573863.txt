Add missing c.g.c.collect.testing manual emulations.
Withdraw c.g.c.escape manual emulations.
Add internal tests that make it less likely that we'll miss manual emulations in the future.
(It's still pretty likely, though, since the error occurs only if someone creates the fileset and associated test but forgets to update the build rule....)
