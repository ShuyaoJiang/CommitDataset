Make Ints.tryParse available under GWT.

It already works, thanks to careful avoidance of overflow in checks against |cap| and MIN_VALUE.
(Contrast the previous (Android) version, which may or may not have worked under GWT because GWT integers don't wrap when they overflow. (I think that our workaround for this was successful, but it's hard to be confident.))

Also, enable the tests for *Longs*.tryParse under GWT.
(I also added a few more tests to both versions just to be paranoid.)
