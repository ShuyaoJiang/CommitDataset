Automatically add <inherits> for java.* emulations to Guava.
Remove the manually added <inherits>.

This change applies only to java.* emulations: Normally <inherits> are added automatically as part of the build.
The problem here was that the java.* <inherits> added were for internal-only modules that only transitively pulled in the public modules.
This change rewrites the internal-only module names to match the public module names.

The result is mostly a no-op, but, in addition to some theoretically irrelevant reordering, the automation also produces a few <inherit> fixes:
- Remove net -> util.
- Remove collect/testing -> util.
- Add collect/testing -> truth.
- Add collect/testing/google -> truth.

Additionally, the automation identifies that cache was missing a BUILD dependency on util.
(It got away with it because the dependency was pulled in transitively through base. (This worked because strict Java deps doesn't fully apply to GWT.))
I have added the appropriate dependency.

(This CL redoes *most* of CL 62235637 (which was rolled back in CL 62240733), and it also touches other packages that that CL did not.)
