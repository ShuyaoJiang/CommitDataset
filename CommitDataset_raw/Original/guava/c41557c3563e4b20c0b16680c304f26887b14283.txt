Change NullPointerTester to work for Stream parameters.

The default-generated proxy for Stream instance will throw ClassCastException if the method/constructor calls collect(), which is common.

The reason for the exception is that stream.collect() return R, which the proxy has no idea  that is'a List<T>, or ImmutableList<T> or whatever. That type is unknown because of erasure.
