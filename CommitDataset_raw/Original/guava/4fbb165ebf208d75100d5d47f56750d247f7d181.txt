Add static factory methods to CharMatcher equivalent to the existing constants.

Also do some significant reorganization, primarily extracting anonymous CharMatcher implementations to named nested classes and grouping them together at the bottom of the file. This makes it easier to look through the various methods in CharMatcher without being swamped by implementation details of individual matchers. It's also needed for the constant implementations to create a place to put a static final INSTANCE field (which will allow the implementations to be effetively constants, but also lazily loaded, once we remove the constant fields.
