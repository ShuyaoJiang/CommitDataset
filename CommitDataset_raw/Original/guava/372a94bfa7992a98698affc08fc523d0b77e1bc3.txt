Rollback

People depend on the exact error message.  (They should feel bad, and they'll need to get fixed.)

*** Original change description ***

Simplify and organize various Map implementations.  Specifically:

* factor out Hashing.smearedHash
* organize the CompactHash collections' implementations better
* use consistent error messages for ImmutableMap and subclasses when rejecting duplicate elements
