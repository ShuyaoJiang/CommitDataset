Rework RegularImmutableSortedSet to be backed by an ImmutableList instead of an array.

Make IDN conform more closely to the Mozilla PS algorithm. In the process, we introduce a weird disjunction in our definition, but that seems unavoidable (for now?).

Make com.google.common.base.Equivalence{,s} GwtCompatible.

Make Futures.compose(Future, Function) wrap any RuntimeException/Error that occurs in an ExecutionException.
Also, call the Function only once even if it throws.
(Futures.compose(ListenableFuture, Function) already had both these behaviors.)

Do not cancel() when interrupted. Do restore the interrupt.
