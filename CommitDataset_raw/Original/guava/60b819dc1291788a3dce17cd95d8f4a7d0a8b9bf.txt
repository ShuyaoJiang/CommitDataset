Total rewrite of emulated CacheBuilder to emulated LocalCache. Features added include recordStats, expireAfterAccess, ticker, and removalListener.

This version is updated to include support for values(), keySet(), and entries(), as well as iterators generated by these. These methods are used occasionally and the removal had led to errors in the first submission.

This version has been tested on failing tests reported last submission and found to have no impact on these tests.
