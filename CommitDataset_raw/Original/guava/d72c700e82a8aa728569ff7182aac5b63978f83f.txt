Fix GWT behavior of "opportunistic" ImmutableList subclasses.
The "standard" ImmutableLists were fine, but Lists.charactersOf() and
TransformedImmutableList were broken.
Under Java, they inherited working implementations of their methods; under GWT,
they inherited versions that forwarded to an empty "delegate" collection.
I've overridden all forwarding methods in the GWT emulation in order to avoid
this.
I've also added tests for charactersOf(), which reveal that GWT
String/StringBuilder doesn't perform index checks, so I've added manual checks.
TransformedImmutableList could probably stand to have some tests, too, but at
least it will be exercised indirectly through the asList() views implemented
atop it in Louis's coming CL, which is in fact what revealed these problems.
