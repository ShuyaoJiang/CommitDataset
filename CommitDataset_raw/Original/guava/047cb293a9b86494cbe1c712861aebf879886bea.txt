This CL fixes usage of equality operators for subclasses of java.lang.Number. Comparing numeric objects using "==" tests for reference equality, when most likely value equality is intended. This an automated fix using error-prone.

We intend to make this a compilation error in Google's Java compiler, so it is necessary to fix existing occurrences first to avoid breaking builds.
