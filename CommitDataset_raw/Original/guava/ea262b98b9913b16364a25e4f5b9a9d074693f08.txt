setFuture documentation tweaks:
- Describe cancellation propagation.
- Stop referring to setFuture as though it *always* "sets asynchronously."
- Small tweak that I'm not sure actually helps: change "previously been set or cancelled" to "already been set or cancelled." Somehow I feel like this is marginally clearer that it refers to "done at the time of the setFuture call" rather than "done at the time the supplied Future completes." Am I crazy? Maybe I should just say "done at the time the supplied Future completes?"
- Maybe other stuff I've forgotten.
