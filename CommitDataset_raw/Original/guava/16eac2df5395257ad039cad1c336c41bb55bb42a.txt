Minor bug fix and simplifications in common.collect, including:

* Iterables.skip(iterable, size)'s iterator would wrongly remove the last element of the input if the user called [next(), remove()].
* In Iterators.concat, instead of using checkNotNull and Arrays.asList, just use ImmutableList.of
* Use Itera{tors,bles}.addAll instead of for loops in Sets factory methods
* Simplify Lists.charactersOf implementations
