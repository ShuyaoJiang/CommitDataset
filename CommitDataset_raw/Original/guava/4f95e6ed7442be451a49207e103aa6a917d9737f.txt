Remove a redundant RegularImmutableSortedSet workaround for comparators that are inconsistent with equals().
The workaround, added in CL 13880333, existed to support ImmutableSortedAsList.
However, it turned out that the workaround was needed for other types, too, and it was added to ImmutableSortedAsList itself (but not removed from RegularImmutableSortedSet) in CL 29041788.
This CL removes the redundant RegularImmutableSortedSet copy, moving its comments into the ImmutableSortedAsList copy.
Additionally, it adds a test to demonstrate that the redundant copy, which is no longer used only by asList(), was causing problems.
Our existing tests caught a similar problem when I applied Louis's pending http://codereview.appspot.com/6218056/
