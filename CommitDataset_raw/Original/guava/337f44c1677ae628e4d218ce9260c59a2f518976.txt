As currently defined, the hashcode of every unordered EndpointPair which is a self-loop is zero! This is particularly not good for graphs with many self-loops, such as the transitive closure graph, where every node has an incident self-loop. Change hash to use + instead of ^ (this still preserves the property of symmetry, even with overflow).
