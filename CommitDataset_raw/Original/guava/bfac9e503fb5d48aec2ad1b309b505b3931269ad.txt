Increase timeout.

I just tried running the GWT tests because I expected them to fail from []They unexpectedly passed because "[WARNING] Forked JVM has been killed on time-out after 21600 seconds" is non-fatal :(

With this change, the expected tests fail (as do some others, for reasons that I'll address in other CLs).
