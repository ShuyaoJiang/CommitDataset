Extract CollectPreconditions with some common checks.
Use those checks more widely, especially checkRemove.
More importantly, use checkEntryNotNull to include the key and value in "null key/value" NPEs of ImmutableMultimap and GWT-only ImmutableMap/ImmutableBiMap.
(Non-GWT ImmutableMap/ImmutableBiMap already got this right.)
Plus, make ImmutableMap.copyOf(enumMap) and ImmutableMultimap.put(Entry) resilient to entries whose keys or values become null midway through construction.
