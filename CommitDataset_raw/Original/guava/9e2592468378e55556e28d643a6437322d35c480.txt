Make ListenerCallQueue functionality available outside the concurrent package internally. Changes:
- encapsulate list of listeners functionality
- rename Callback interface to Event and make it lambda-compatible
- move "methodName" to just be toString() on Event, which also defers/avoids unnecessary allocations
- remove @GuardedBy suppression
