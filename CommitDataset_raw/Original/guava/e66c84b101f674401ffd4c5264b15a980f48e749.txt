Open source some more benchmarks.
The Monitor benchmarks were left as internal when the class was migrated from Labs.
My guess is that that was nothing more than "Caliper benchmarks can't be open-sourced yet."
I notice that earlier CLs didn't open-source them, either.
My guess is that that's just because they were excluded from the BUILD rule entirely and not merely marked with @GoogleInternal.
My guess is that the same is true of the EventBus benchmark.
