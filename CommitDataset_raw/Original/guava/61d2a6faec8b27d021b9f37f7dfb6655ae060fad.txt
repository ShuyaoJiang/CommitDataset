Set version numbers to 24.0-jre-SNAPSHOT.

This makes Maven consider 24.0-jre to be "newer" than 24.0-android.
That's preferable, as discussed in https://github.com/google/guava/issues/2914, https://github.com/google/guava/issues/2839, and https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NYGbfz56C0Oh4IGymXjeQUVK4FcRiqDbpc4vGLnDMrY/edit#

RELNOTES: To upgrade to Guava 24.0, change your version numbers to "24.0-jre." (Or, if are writing an Android app or Android-compatible library, use "24.0-android.")
