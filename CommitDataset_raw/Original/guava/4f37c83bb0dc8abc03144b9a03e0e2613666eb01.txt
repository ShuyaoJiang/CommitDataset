Deprecate InputSupplier, OutputSupplier and all public methods in common.io that use either type. Also release methods on Byte/CharSource that take ByteProcessor and LineProcessor so that the equivalent methods in Byte/CharStreams can be deprecated reasonably.

Schedule InputSupplier and OutputSupplier to be removed in June 2015 (they weren't @Beta apparently) and schedule the deprecated methods to be removed in 18.0, to give plenty of time for conversion.
