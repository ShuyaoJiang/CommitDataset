Adds @CheckReturnValue to chainable methods of FluentIterable. Thanks to error-prone, this will cause [] to refuse to build any code that doesn't store the return value from these methods.

It will prevent subtle bugs where code is treating FluentIterable as though it is mutable, when in fact it is immutable.
