Major refactoring of the com.google.common.graph APIs (including updates to client code):
-Remove DirectedGraph and UndirectedGraph interfaces; a Graph's directedness can now be queried with graph.isDirected().
-Remove GraphConfig class; use the query methods directly on the Graph interface instead.
-Add GraphBuilder; use this instead of Graphs.create[Un]Directed(GraphConfig)
-Remove ImmutableGraph.Builder; ImmutableGraph construction is now done with ImmutableGraph.copyOf(Graph).
-Rename multigraph() to allowsParallelEdges(boolean).
-Rename noSelfLoops() to allowsSelfLoops(boolean).

Old example syntax for creating a graph:
  DirectedGraph<N, E> graph = Graphs.createDirected(GraphConfig.multigraph());

New example syntax for creating a graph:
  Graph<N, E> graph = GraphBuilder.directed().allowsParallelEdges(true).build();
