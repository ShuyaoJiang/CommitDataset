Avoid generating calls to GWT-incompatible setUp or tearDown methods.

Prior to this CL, such methods would generate compile errors:

[ERROR] Line 24: The method setUp() from the type TestCase is not visible
[ERROR] Line 32: The method tearDown() from the type TestCase is not visible

[]

Also, remove the workaround I added to com.google.common.
