Strip <resource> lines from .gwt.xml. They are not yet supported by a release version of GWT. (Support was added in internal CL 62367280, which imported <https://gwt.googlesource.com/gwt/+/f39e11150ef0ea635a7f7d30154221907775efc6>. I'm not sure when our build was changed to generate the new elements.)
