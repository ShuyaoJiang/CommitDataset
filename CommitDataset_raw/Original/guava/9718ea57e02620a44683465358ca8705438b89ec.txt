Change the definition of hashcode for Networks (map of edges to endpoints) to more closely mirror hashcode for Graphs (map of edges to value). Also the map we're basing the hashcode on is now half the size for undirected networks, which is nice (a downside is that isolated nodes don't affect the hashcode, but I'm not too worried about that).
