Delete com.google.math.Sample.

This CL also migrates the last usage of it to Stats â€” it so happens that the last usage is in a subpackage of math, so I think it's okay to do it at the same time (especially as it's a safe local change that only affects unit tests).

It also removes a couple of references in the javadoc for the Quantiles benchmark algorithms class (which probably shouldn't have been in the open source version anyway, oops). They don't really add value now.
