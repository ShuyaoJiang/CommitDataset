When a new entry exceeds the segment's maxWeight all by itself, don't bother evicting anything else, only the new one. Still go through all the motions of actually adding and evicting it; otherwise I fear the code complexity will skyrocket.

In a sense this starts us down a path of trying to make weight-based eviction "smart", and it's not clear where that should end up, but I think this seems like a logical special case no matter what.
