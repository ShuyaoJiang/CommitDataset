Fix Guava issue 1751

http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/issues/detail?id=1751

The bug is that this test depends on listener ordering. I believe that this race was technically introduced by [], since our strategy for invoking listener callbacks was sufficiently serialized prior to that cl, such that this was safe even though it violated the spec.

As it is, it takes some seriously bad luck to observe the race (thanks cpovirk!)
