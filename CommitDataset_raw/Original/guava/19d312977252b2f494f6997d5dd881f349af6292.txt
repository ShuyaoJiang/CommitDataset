Changed Futures.addCallback() not to call onFailure() when onSuccess() throws.

Note to test owners:

This change revealed test bugs in your test. The old code swallowed EasyMock "interaction expected" exception and passed it to your onFailure() method, which is a usually a no-op.

I didn't dig deeply enough into your code to understand if the offending interactions are supposed to happen. The fix is just blindly adding expect() call to make the tests pass.

If you see a real bug, please let me know.

Thanks!
