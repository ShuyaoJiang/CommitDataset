- For a Collection<T> parameter that we don't know how to generate, fail the test. Previously, we would sometimes generate a Collection<String>, since the value is usually used only for equals() and hashCode() testing. (All this also applies to most other JDK and Guava collection types.) http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/issues/detail?id=1665
- For Optional parameters, generate Optional.absent() before generating any Optional.of(...) instances.
- Deprecate setSampleInstances in favor of setDistinctValues.
