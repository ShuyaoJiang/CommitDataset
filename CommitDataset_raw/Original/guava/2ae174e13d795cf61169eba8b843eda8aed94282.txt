Pull LOWER_BOUND_FN and UPPER_BOUND_FN into their own classes, instead of having them be static constants in Range itself.  They aren't actually used in Range itself, just in other APIs using Range.

Effects on RangeProGuard:
59099 bytes => 58681 bytes
13 classes => 12 classes
112 methods => 110 methods
