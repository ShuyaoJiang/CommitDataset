Make more classes serializable.
Merged from cgdecker's patch for Enums.valueOfFunction, Equivalence.Wrapper, Optional, Range (and Cut), the DiscreteDomain implementations, and ContiguousSet (but skipped Holder)

The patch also:
- adds equals/hashCode for Enums.valueOfFunction
- makes the DiscreteDomain constructor visible, internally and externally (possibly controversial? but the whole class is still @Beta, anyway)

Revision created by MOE tool push_codebase.
