Rewrite Futures.immediate*Future with simple immutable Future implementations, and change Futures.immediateFailingFuture to not rethrow on Error.  This speeds up the creation of immediate futures by a factor of 10, which is significant for, e.g. the upcoming asynchronous cache, which uses many more immediate futures, particularly for the translation layer between CacheLoader and AsyncCacheLoader.
