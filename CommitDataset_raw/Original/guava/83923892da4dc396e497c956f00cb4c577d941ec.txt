Remove more possible static-init deadlocks (https://github.com/google/guava/issues/1977).

- ImmutableSortedMultiset: I couldn't figure out a way for this to actually deadlock, but I figure it's best for it to follow the pattern of the others.
- ImmutableSortedSet: This might be able to deadlock if one thread creates a RegularImmutableMap (which then calls into RegularImmutableSortedSet and then ImmutableSet) while another initializes ImmutableSortedSet (which then calls into RegularImmutableSortedSet).
- ImmutableTable: This might be able to deadlock if one thread GWT-deserializes a SparseImmutableTable (which then calls into ImmutableTable) while another initializes ImmutableTable (which calls into SparseImmutableTable).
