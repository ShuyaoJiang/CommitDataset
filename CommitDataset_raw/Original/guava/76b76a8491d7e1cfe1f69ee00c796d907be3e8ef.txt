Re-add create() methods with an int expectedInsertions parameter.

These methods should probably live on indefinitely for binary compatibility.

Also add @since 19.0 to the versions with a long parameter, since they're technically newly added methods, and add a paragraph from the 3-param version that was missing to the 2-param version.
