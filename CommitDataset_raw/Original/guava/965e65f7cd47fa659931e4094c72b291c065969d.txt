Marks the methods in Longs regarding byte array conversions as GWT compatible,
and adapts the LongsTest to run the tests in GWT mode.

The only method not yet being GWT compatible was toByteArray, due to a bug in
how GWT handles narrowing conversions on byte casts. To fix this, copied
the implementation from util.UnsignedLongs.toByteArray, which is already used
by GWT applications in [].
