Optimize murmur3_32 hashString(CharSequence, UTF_8) to unroll the Utf8 directly into the hasher rather than converting it to a byte array.

Benchmark results: Pure ASCII took 83% as much time, "rare exotic" text took 43% as much time (!), and everything in between took an in-between amount of time.  Unnecessary garbage was reduced to zero.
