In Java 7 branch, don't bother using Iterators.forArray in RegularImmutable{List,Set}.  The default ImmutableList.listIterator implementation amounts to the same thing, an AbstractIndexedListIterator delegating to the array.

Effects on ImmutableSetProGuard:
22598 bytes => 20871 bytes
17 classes => 15 classes
147 methods => 144 methods
