Stabilize the UncaughtExceptionHandlers against exceptions thrown in
logging. Quoting from the Java manual: "Any exception thrown by this
method [uncaughtException] will be ignored by the Java Virtual Machine."
This seems slightly paranoid, but doesn't cost us much and avoids stupid
non-terminations in OOM situations or other logging failures.
