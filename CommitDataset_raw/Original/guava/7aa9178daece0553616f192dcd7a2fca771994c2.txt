Rename MutableGraph.addEdge(N, N) to MutableGraph.putEdge(N, N) (to indicate that Graphs do not support parallel edges and for consistency with the upcoming ValueGraph interface). Change the order of parameters in MutableNetwork.addEdge(E, N, N) to MutableNetwork.addEdge(N, N, E).

The migration for the latter will be done in two steps, in order to avoid silently breaking someone with a WIP change involving a Network<N, E> where N == E. The method with the new parameter order will temporarily be called addEdgeV2, and is planned to be changed back to addEdge the evening of Wednesday, August 10.
