Add some validation to predecessor/succesor counts. This should also catch the unlikely (impossible?) case where there are more than Integer.MAX_VALUE predecessors or succesors. Alternatively we could change these to longs, but that adds ~8 bytes to every node, and I'm already pretty sure a HashMap cannot hold more than 2^30 entries.
