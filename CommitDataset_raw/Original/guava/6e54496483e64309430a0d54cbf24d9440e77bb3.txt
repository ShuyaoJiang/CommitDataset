Added AbstractPackageSanityTests to apply automated sanity tests for an entire package.

Yaks I needed to shave:
- move a piece of reusable code from NullPointerTester into a new DummyProxy class.
- Added a few new default values to ArbitraryInstances. (I'm thinking to change the default value of numbers to 1, in a separate CL)

Added PackageSanityTests to common.reflect and common.testing, as dogfooding. Had to add some @Nullable and missing checkNotNull() as a result.

Since APST is classpath sensitive, there are a lot of top-level class fixture files in the packagesanity package and each test case corresponds to a single java_test rule. That makes the CL more daunting than it actually is.
