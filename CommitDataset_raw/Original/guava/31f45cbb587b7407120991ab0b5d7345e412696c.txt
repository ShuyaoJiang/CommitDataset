Add a few final(?) tests.

Most are tests of null handling, since our automated null tests don't run under GWT.
I've added checkNotNull() calls where appropriate.

One is to verify that a failing listener doesn't interfere with other added listeners.

I also added a test of get() with a negative value, as concurrency classes generally permit:
"All methods that accept timeout parameters treat values less than or equal to zero to mean not to wait at all."
