Add some performance enhancements to Striped:

1. Enhance bulkGet to not call getAt() for runs of identical stripes
2. Introduce a new Striped implementation for LazyWeak Striped instances with
small numbers of stripes

To justify this I also added a caliper benchmark.

It is a minor runtime improvement in all but cases where there are a small
number of stripes where it is a major improvement

The LAZY_SMALL appears to be superior in all cases until the stripes size gets very large where the large array size becomes a potential issue.  Due to this i have introduced a static integer LARGE_LAZY_CUTOFF at 1024 so that lazyWeak striped instances with more than that many stripes use the legacy implementation.
