Prepare common.graph for GWT/j2cl usage.

1. Had to replace String.format() uses, because it's not supported for j2cl.
2. Had to mark Network-related code as @GwtIncompatible because of uses of
   java.lang.ref.SoftReference, which j2cl cannot support.

Needed as a step toward using common.graph in JSCompiler.
