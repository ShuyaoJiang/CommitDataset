Use key insertion order in HashBiMap.

This bumps memory consumption back up to equal a pair of HashMaps; the shared entries in both directions are just enough to pay for the linked list.  On the other hand, we're not actually allocating any additional objects, so this shouldn't be a significant loss for Android.
