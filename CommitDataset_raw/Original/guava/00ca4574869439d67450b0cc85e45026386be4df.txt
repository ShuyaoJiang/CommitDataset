Add Java Checksums (CRC32, Adler32) to Hashing.

This is done so that we can allow users to easily compute the checksum of some bytes (a file, say) without having to use the Checksum API directly.

Also add an abstract Hasher shared by MessageDigestHashFunction and ChecksumHashFunction, since they operate basically the same way.
