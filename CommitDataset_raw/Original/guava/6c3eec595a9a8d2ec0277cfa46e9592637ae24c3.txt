Release Listening{,Scheduled}ExecutorService and MoreExecutors.listeningDecorator as @Beta by using Jsr166AbstractExecutorService.
Make MoreExecutors.sameThreadExecutor implement ListeningExecutorService.
Also, revert a few Guava-fications of non-Guava @since tags.

Get Jsr166AbstractExecutorService to compile in Guava by:
(1) providing a compile-time-only JSR166 version of ExecutorService
(2) changing its newTaskFor methods to return ListenableFutureTask
