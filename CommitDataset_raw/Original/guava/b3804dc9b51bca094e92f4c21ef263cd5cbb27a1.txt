Fix our TODO comments to include username as required, usually naming
myself.  Remove a few I don't think we need, and handle one (it said "use
this method from Maps when that class is gwt-safe"). Make moe not choke on
unrecognized usernames. Whitelist a few usernames for non-scrubbing who
have agreed to it.
