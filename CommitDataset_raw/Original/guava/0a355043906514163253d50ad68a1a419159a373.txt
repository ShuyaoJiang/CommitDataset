Fix a number of test failures running the backport under JDK5.

- Sets.testPowerSetIteration seemed to be relying on the order of elements in a HashSet.
- ImmutableSortedSetTest.testDifferentComparator_serialization was relying on Collections.reverseOrder() deserializing to the singleton instance of it.
- ImmutableSortedMultisetTest.testCopyOfDefensiveCopy and testCopyOfSortedDefensiveCopy were relying on the JDK calling toArray(), while JDK5 is calling toArray(T[]).
