Change PathByteSource in MoreFiles to not use Files.readAllBytes() for its read() method, as Files.readAllBytes() creates 2 unnecessary copies of the byte array the file is read into in the normal case where the file doesn't change size.

In the process of doing that, a few other changes:
- Change both PathByteSource and FileByteSource to delegate to a new package-private method ByteStreams.toByteArray(InputStream, int) which handles reading to a byte array when you have an expected size.
- Also change both implementations to get the expected size for the file from the size() method on FileChannel/SeekableByteChannel instead of reading the size attribute before opening the stream.
