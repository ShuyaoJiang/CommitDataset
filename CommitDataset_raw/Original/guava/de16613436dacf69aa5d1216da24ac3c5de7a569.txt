Remove redundant Multiset.contains() tests from AbstractMultisetTest, which are already covered in CollectionContainsTester as part of MultisetTestSuiteBuilder, and add a couple more multiset-specific tests.

In the process, fix a genuine bug where RegularImmutableSortedSet.containsAll assumed that a nonempty sorted collection with the same comparator didn't have multiples of an element.
