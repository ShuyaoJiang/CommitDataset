Fix inheriting docs from the JDK.

This broke somewhere between 18.0 and 19.0, I'd wildly speculate because of changes to Maven?
http://google.github.io/guava/releases/18.0/api/docs/com/google/common/hash/BloomFilter.html#hashCode%28%29
http://google.github.io/guava/releases/19.0/api/docs/com/google/common/hash/BloomFilter.html#hashCode%28%29

So it took 2-3 years to notice :\

I chose this new phase based on:
"Invokes the execution of the lifecycle phase generate-sources prior to executing itself."
https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-javadoc-plugin/javadoc-mojo.html

And generate-sources seems to make more sense than anything that comes before that:
http://maven.apache.org/ref/3.5.2/maven-core/lifecycles.html
