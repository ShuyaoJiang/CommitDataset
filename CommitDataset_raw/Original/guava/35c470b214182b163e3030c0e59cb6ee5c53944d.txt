Migrate users calling new LinkedHashMap(int) to
Maps.newLinkedHashMapWithExpectedSize when it appears that that is what they
actually want.

new LinkedHashMap(int) sets the size of the internal hashtable to the given
size, but usually callers really just want a hash table that is large enough
for a given number of elements.  newLinkedHashMapWithExpectedSize does exactly
that.
