Make RegularImmutableSet extend ImmutableSet directly, not ImmutableSet.Indexed.

The only side effects are that the iterator is slightly more efficient (less indirection), and importing ImmutableSet by itself doesn't import helpers for ImmutableSet views of other collections.  A minor gain, but they add up.

Effects on ImmutableSetProGuard: ([]31249 bytes => 30128 bytes
28 classes => 26 classes
198 methods => 192 methods
