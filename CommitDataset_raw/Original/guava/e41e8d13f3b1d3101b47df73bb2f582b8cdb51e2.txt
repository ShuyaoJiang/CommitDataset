Use the primitive "number" type instead of the object counterpart "Number" to avoid a jscompiler error.

An upcoming change to J2CL that simplifies how casting logic is transpiled will make the code "(Number) (Object) 3" here transpile to just "/** @type {Number} */ (3)" and jscompiler will see the "invalid cast" since "3" is not "Number" in the closure type system.
