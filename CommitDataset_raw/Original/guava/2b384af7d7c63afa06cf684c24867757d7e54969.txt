As part of that, I tried to clarify the significance of using ListenableFuture "as an input to another Future." I don't love what I've ended up with, but I'm not optimistic that I'll do better anytime soon.
One part of *that* was switching part of the doc to the second person simply because I couldn't find a good way to make it flow otherwise. I ended up propogating this to more of the doc, and I think it's probably a small net improvement.
