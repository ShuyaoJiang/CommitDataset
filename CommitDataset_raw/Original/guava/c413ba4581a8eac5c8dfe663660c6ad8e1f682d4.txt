Add tests to make sure classes don't get exported to JS by accident/mistake.

This happened once with SafeHtmlBuilder and I nearly did it again recently. We can export classes that make use of @CompileTimeConstant if we make sure we export only specific methods, but for now it's simpler to blank disallow any class with @CompileTimeConstant.
