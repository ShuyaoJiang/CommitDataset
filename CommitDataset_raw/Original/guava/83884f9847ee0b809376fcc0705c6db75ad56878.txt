Guava publicsuffix .gwt.xml fixes:
- Use the Guava-munged .gwt.xml files rather than the Google-internal versions. (The versions are currently identical, but this will change in CL 63334981.)
- Put the .gwt.xml files under guava-gwt instead of guava. (I'm not 100% sure whether this fixes any concrete problems or just removes the .gwt.xml files from the main guava jar, where they clearly don't belong.)
