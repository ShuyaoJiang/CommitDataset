Some enhancements for Futures.transform and Futures.catching
 * extract a template method and 2 subclasses from CatchingFuture and ChainingListenableFuture.  This will allow us to eliminate asAsyncFunction() and 2 allocations per transform
 * make CatchingFuture implement Runnable and save a Runnable allocation
 * have CatchingFuture/ChainingListenableFuture clear all their fields on cancel, which should prevent pinning the transformers
 * have rejectionPropagatingRunnable short circuit for directExecutor() which should save 2 allocations for users who prefer to pass directExecutor() explicitly
 * have Futures.catching use the rejected execution exception logic when it makes sense
