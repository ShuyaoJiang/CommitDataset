Currently, SomeClass<?>.getSubType(SubClass<?, OtherT>) returns SubClass<?, OtherT>.
However, if we do NotGeneric.getSubtype(SubClass<OtherT>), we get SubClass as a raw type instead of
SubClass<OtherT>.

If we fix that bug, then as it turns out we weren't generating proper owners for static classes, so fix that too
