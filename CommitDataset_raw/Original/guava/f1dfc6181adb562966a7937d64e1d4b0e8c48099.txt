Change Sources/Sinks to implement Input/OutputSupplier temporarily, to make migration of usages easier (make it possible to change an InputSupplier to a ByteSource without changing an API that takes an InputSupplier at the same time). The getInput/Output methods are @Deprecated since they shouldn't be called directly. Also make public methods for viewing Input/OutputSuppliers as Sources/Sinks.

Also add Byte/CharStreams.concat, providing concatenation functionality equivalent to join for Sources.
