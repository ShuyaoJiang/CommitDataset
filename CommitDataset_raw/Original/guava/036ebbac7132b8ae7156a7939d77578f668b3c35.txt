- Make AbstractService's Futures implement ListenableFuture by reimplementing the custom Transition class on top of AbstractListenableFuture.
- Remove asciiHtmlEscaper, replaced with Html.htmlContentEscaper.
- Make Service.start() and stop() return a ListenableFuture.
- Eliminate the distinction between Range and DiscreteRange and move operations that used to live in DiscreteRange into ContiguousSet.
- Preserve strict/lenient validation when deriving IDN instances from other IDN instances. No test changes yet; wanted to get feedback on the approach first.
- Add a deprecated version of Ranges.integers() and Ranges.longs() to temporarily fix builds.
- MapMaker:
	- containsValue should fail on collected key
	- refine expiration javadocs
	- structure all reads similarly, documenting more assumptions
	- more white-box tests
- Use constants in UriEscapers instead of PercentEscaper, deprecating the latter.
- Make Javadoc (and occasionally FindBugs) happier.
- Rename package.html files to package-info.html, which are preferred as for JDK 5 (see `man javadoc`).
- Avoid stack overflow.
- Make InternetDomainName lenient validation a little less lenient.
- Remove all usages of Ranges.longs() and Ranges.integers().
