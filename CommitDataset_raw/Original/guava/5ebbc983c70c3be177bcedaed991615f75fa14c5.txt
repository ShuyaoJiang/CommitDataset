Automated g4 rollback of changelist 131198531.

*** Reason for rollback ***

The ArrayDeque implementation in upstream GWT has a bug that is being fixed in https://gwt-review.googlesource.com/#/c/16680/

*** Original change description ***

Use ArrayDeque and PriorityQueue under GWT (where they're newly available), and provide synchronizedQueue, synchronizedDeque, and MinMaxPriorityQueue there.
This also lets us delete our manual implementation of TreeTraverser and avoid LinkedList internally.

Fixes #2545
