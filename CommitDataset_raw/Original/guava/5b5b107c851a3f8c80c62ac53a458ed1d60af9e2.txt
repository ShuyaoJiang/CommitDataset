Eliminate the reevaluateGuards method of Monitor and tighten the contract of Monitor.Guard.

As Dimitris Andreou argued, "reevaluateGuards() ... doesn't seem to offer any advantage ... over ... use of Condition. Basically you give up implicit signaling, the main selling point of this class, and revert to manual signaling. Why not leave that scenario to Condition, and make this class simpler to use for its own sweet spot?"
