Fix two aspects of the AbstractScheduledService.CustomScheduler implementation
1. Give the abstract callback method a more intuitive and convenient signature which will make it easier to ensure that weird things don't happen.
2. Handle exceptions thrown from the scheduling callback.  Previously if this method threw an exception the service would silently stop running.  Typically without any logging or notification of any kind.
