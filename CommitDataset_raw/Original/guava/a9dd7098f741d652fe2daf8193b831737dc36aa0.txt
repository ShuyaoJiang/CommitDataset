Add a gap method to Range which computes the range that lies between two ranges. This operation is particularly useful as a replacement for Joda Time's Interval.gap when migrating to Java Time which has no Interval class.

Joda Time:
Interval interval = ...;
Interval gap = interval.gap(interval);

Java Time (after this CL):
Range<Instant> interval = ...;
Range<Instant> gap = interval.gap(otherInterval);

RELNOTES=Adds a gap() method to Range that computes the Range that lies between them.
