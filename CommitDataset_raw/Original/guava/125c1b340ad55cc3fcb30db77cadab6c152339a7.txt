Add GWT tests for cache and labs.concurrent.
These are the last two packages that use java_and_gwt_library but not java_and_gwt_tests (excluding annotations and labs.converter, both of whose GWT-compatible classes are all annotations).
The newly added tests discovered that Cache.gwt.xml contains dependencies that the package doesn't declare, and I've removed them.
