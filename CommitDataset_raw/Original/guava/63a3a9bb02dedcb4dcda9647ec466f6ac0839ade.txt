Eliminate references to ObjectArrays in the closure of ImmutableSet and ImmutableMap.

ProGuard cannot currently eliminate any class that has a static constant that isn't a primitive or String, and ObjectArrays has the EMPTY_ARRAY static constant.  Instead, we'll directly inline empty object array singletons anywhere we need them; Object[0]s will still be singletons, we'll just have different singletons in different places.
