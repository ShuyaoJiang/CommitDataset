Write compare method in a way that won't look buggy to Error Prone.

This change modifies Java compare methods that are using int casts from longs in
a usually broken way. Int casts in Java will truncate a long value and
consequently may alter the sign of the value being cast. Compare methods may be
implemented using a subtract, iff values are known not to be near overflowing
limits. When the values are longs you can get:

int compare(MyLongHolder other) {
  return (int)(other.x - x);
}

As the cast wonâ€™t preserve the sign of the subtract it is buggy and can lead to
broken sort orders.
