[guava concurrent] Renamed SerializingExecutor to SequentialExecutor. Turned SerializingExecutor into a proxy to SequentialExecutor so two Components classes that directly use it have a chance to catch up.

Components CL to change Components usages should be independent.

RELNOTES: Renamed Guava's SerializingExecutor to SequentialExecutor to match the new MoreExecutors.sequentialExecutor() method.
