Implement ByteSource.asCharSource(charset).read() using the decoding string constructor instead of streaming the contents into a StringBuilder.

this allows us to avoid a number of copies that are currently happening for each character (1. into a temporary CharBuffer, 2. into a StringBuilder, 3 into the String char[]) and replace it with simply whatever is required by ByteSource.read() and the String(byte[], charset) constructor.  For certain ByteSource implementations (like FileByteSource) ByteSource.read() can often presize the byte[] correctly and the string constructor can also do some things to guess at the correct array sizes and avoid copies in the common case.

Benchmarks have shown that this should improve the speed of Files.toString significantly.

further work should also be done for the normal CharSource.read implementation.
