Eliminate SingletonImmutableSet, partially folding it into RegularImmutableSet.

We skip allocating an all-up hash table for a singleton set, but we share implementation with the hash-based RegularImmutableSet.

[]Effects on ImmutableSetProGuard:
26650 bytes => 24854 bytes
21 classes => 19 classes
165 methods => 149 methods

Effects on ImmutableMapProGuard:
50050 bytes => 50176 bytes, no other changes.
(I infer that SingletonImmutableSet wasn't actually in the post-ProGuard transitive closure from ImmutableMap and that we just added a little bit of code to a utility method that was.)
