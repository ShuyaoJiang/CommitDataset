Use ArrayDeque and PriorityQueue under GWT (where they're newly available), and provide synchronizedQueue, synchronizedDeque, and MinMaxPriorityQueue there.
This also lets us delete our manual implementation of TreeTraverser and avoid LinkedList internally.

Fixes #2545

(Roll forward CL 131198531, which was rolled back in CL 131218608 because of a GWT bug that has since been fixed.)
