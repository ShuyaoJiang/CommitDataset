Second try at adding MoreExecutors.platformThreadFactory().
Now if ThreadManager.currentRequestThreadFactory() throws, we fall back to Executors.defaultThreadFactory().
In particular, this happens when AppEngine is running in this JVM, but there is no AppEngine context for the current thread (i.e. we're "outside" appengine).

Roll forward after handling leaked system properties more robustly.

*** Original change description ***

Automated g4 rollback of changelist 35431636.

*** Reason for rollback ***

Breaks puppet tests, where we falsely detect the environment to be AppEngine due to system property leakage.

*** Original change description ***

Add MoreExecutors.platformThreadFactory(), an AppEngine-aware version of Executors#defaultThreadFactory.

Update classes within c.g.c
