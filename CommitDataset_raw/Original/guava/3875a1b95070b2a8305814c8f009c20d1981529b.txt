Add Futures.getDone().

Also, make immediateCancelledFuture() available under GWT, since I use it in the new tests.
To use cancellationExceptionWithCause() from it, I had to move that method out of the server-only AbstractFuture.java and into the shared Futures.java.
This runs somewhat counter to my effort to make Futures.java smaller. Maybe we'll want a Util/Helpers class, though I'm not quite sure what else would go in it (executeListener? currently non-static maybePropagateCancellation?).
