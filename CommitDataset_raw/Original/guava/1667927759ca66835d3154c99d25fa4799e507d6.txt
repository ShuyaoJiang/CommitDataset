Move many implementations out of Futures.java (https://github.com/google/guava/issues/2091).
Mostly I've moved them to new classes, but I've also moved rejectionPropagatingExecutor to MoreExecutors (unmodified except for a new null check).

This also revealed that the GWT copy-pasted catching/catchingAsync code was missing use of rejectionPropagatingExecutor. This is now fixed.

Also, reformat the moved code.
