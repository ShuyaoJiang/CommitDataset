Convert much of Guava to Truth by using Refaster.

The motivation was my wish for a better ThrowablesTest error message in https://github.com/google/guava/issues/2130 (though I'm pretty confident that the problem there is \n vs. \r\n).
I made a lot of changes, but I left a lot undone. In particular, I avoided most of the collection assertions, since we often want to test specific collection methods. e.g., we don't necessarily want get() to be rewritten to containsKey().
