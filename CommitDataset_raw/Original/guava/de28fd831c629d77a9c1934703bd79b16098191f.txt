[FUTURES] Added Futures.whenAllComplete(..).run(..) to Futures.java

Since runnable cannot throw checked exception, you cannot use getDone when defining your runnable which is a shame :(

RELNOTES:
  - Add a run method to FutureCombiner to allow passing a runnable to Futures.whenAllComplete and Futures.whenAllSucceed
