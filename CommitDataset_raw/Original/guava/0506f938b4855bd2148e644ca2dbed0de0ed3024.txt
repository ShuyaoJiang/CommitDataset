Add a method that tells how many permits are stored and can be used without blocking future tryAcquire calls.

Successfully acquiring permits when the rate is set to near zero causes all subsequent tryAcquire calls to fail even after setting the rate really really high. For our use-case we don't want to ever incur this penalty and would instead want to only acquire if we've stored up enough.
