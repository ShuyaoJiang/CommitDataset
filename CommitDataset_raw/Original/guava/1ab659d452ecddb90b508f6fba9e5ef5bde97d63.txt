Fix a class loading ordering bug on android.

Apparently in some android versions (and/or testing environments, maybe?) Unsafe.getFieldOffset(Field) will trigger initialization (not just loading) of the class that declares the field.  This causes an ordering bug where when the Waiter class is initialized ATOMIC_HELPER is null.
