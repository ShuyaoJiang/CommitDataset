Allow Service to transition from STARTING to TERMINATED. Add a new "doCancelStart" method that is called when a service is stopped while still starting. This gives implementations a chance to abort code which may be preventing the service from starting.

RELNOTES=Added `doCancelStart` protected method to `AbstractService`
