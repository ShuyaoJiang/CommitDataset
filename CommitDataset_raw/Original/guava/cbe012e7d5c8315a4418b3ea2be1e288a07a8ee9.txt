Run the tests from the class instead of those from some other class.

I seem to recall some weirdness around adding suites to themselves -- like, the tests were getting run even without the self-add call except in some unusual case like when you requested a run of a specific class with --test_arg/--test_filter? I forget. Anyway, I came across this while trying to run the tests under Android, which apparently we don't do.
