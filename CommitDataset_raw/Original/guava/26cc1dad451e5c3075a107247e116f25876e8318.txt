Add failure causes as supressed exceptions for each failed service in the exception thrown by
awaitHealthy.

Technically these supressed exceptions are already logged, but putting the
exceptions in the exception that is actually thrown is slightly more useful
since it will get picked up properly by some tools which expect to
interrogate causes.
