Endpoints.java: revert language change in Endpoints.adjacentNode()'s exception message; "does not contain" seems more appropriate even though Endpoints is no longer a Collection.  "is incident to" implies that "Endpoints" is really a misnomer for "Edge", which is sort of OK for Graph but not so much for Network, and "contain" works in both cases.
