Push of latest guava code which unfortunately includes temporarily backing out
the common.testing stuff, which still hasn't been figured out properly in a way
that allows us to keep internal and external codebases synchronized.  That
stuff may or may not be available as part of release 8 after all.


Revision created by MOE tool push_codebase.
