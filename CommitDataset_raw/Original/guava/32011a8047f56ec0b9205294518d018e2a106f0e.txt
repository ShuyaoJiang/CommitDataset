Marginally improve what Maven prints for javac errors (by upgrading maven-compiler-plugin).

Before:
[ERROR] /home/cpovirk/clients/guava-black/guava/guava/src/com/google/common/reflect/Types.java:[607,7] error: cannot find symbol

After:
[ERROR] /home/cpovirk/clients/guava-black/guava/guava/src/com/google/common/reflect/Types.java:[607,8] cannot find symbol
  symbol: class Overridez
