A number of small changes and fixes in EventBus:
- flattenHierarchy was catching an exception that couldn't be thrown because the CacheLoader doesn't throw a checked exception. Fix it to catch the right exception type.
- Change eventsToDispatch to use non-thread safe queues since it's a ThreadLocal.
