Replace "DirectedIncidentNodes" and "UndirectedIncidentNodes" with a shared "IncidentNodes" class that implements Set. This avoids the call to .asImmutableSet() that the directed graphs were performing, and also makes it so that we are now very close to having an abstract base graph implementation that will almost entirely replace the 4 current implementations.
