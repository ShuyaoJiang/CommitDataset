Make ExecutionList smaller and faster by using a manual queue instead of a LinkedList.

With these changes:
* An empty/executed ExecutionList is now half the size (20 vs. 40 bytes), it is also smaller after execution as well.
* The new ExecutionList takes 16 fewer bytes per listener added also there is only 1 object allocated instead of 2.  Also, if the list has already been executed there is no longer any allocation in add.
* There were also performance gains between 0 and 20% across the 4 benchmarks I wrote.
