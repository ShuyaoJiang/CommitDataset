Refactor the test classes from the previous hierarchy:

                      AbstractGraphTest
                        |           |
                        v           v
        AbstractMutableGraphTest   AbstractImmutableGraphTest
         |                    |
         v                    v
AbstractDirectedGraphTest   AbstractUndirectedGraphTest

to the following:

                      AbstractGraphTest
                        |           |
                        v           v
      AbstractDirectedGraphTest   AbstractUndirectedGraphTest
                  |                             |
                  v                             v
AbstractImmutableDirectedGraphTest   AbstractImmutableUndirectedGraphTest

Unfortunately the lack of multiple inheritance in Java means we have to choose between whether we want inherit from a base "immutable graph test" or get all the functionality of the base "(un)directed graph" test. Both involve some amount of code duplication for full test coverage, but I think this is the better option of the two given that the (un)directed tests are likely to have more tests added over time, whereas a base immutability test is unlikely to be expanded much (the tests for this are currently repeated between AbstractImmutableDirectedGraphTest and  AbstractImmutableUndirectedGraphTest).
