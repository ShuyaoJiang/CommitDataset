This CL fixes method calls that incorrectly ignore the return
value. Method calls with no side-effect are pointless if you
ignore the value returned. Also, this error is triggered if the
return value of a method that has been annotated with
@CheckReturnValue is ignored. This an automated fix using
error-prone.

We intend to make this a compilation error in Google's Java compiler,
so it is necessary to fix existing occurrences first to avoid breaking
builds.
