graphs_explained.md: file being added to facilitate reviewed changes to https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/GraphsExplained.

Includes updates to the top-level graph type class Javadoc also.

Replaces "iff" with "if" throughout common.graph, to address GitHub issue #2605.

cgdecker@, this is going to need to be cherrypicked for the final release.
