ImmediateFuture.toString() implementation to provide the returned value or exception.
Provides for all ImmediateFutures implementation the same syntax that AbstractFuture uses.

It's especially convenient during debugging of mocked asynchronous gRPC services.

Fixes bug in AbstractFuture#toString in GWT that caused wrong representation:
"Class$S413@205[status=SUCCESS, result=[FAILURE, cause=[Class$S6]]" due to ongoing
builder being already called when getDone() throws exception.
