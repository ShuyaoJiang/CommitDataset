Update documentation for Interners.
Since Java 7, the String.intern() does not allocate the strings in permgen, but instead on the heap (in a table whose bucket size is configurable using XX:StringTableSize).

See http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6962930
and http://java-performance.info/string-intern-in-java-6-7-8/
