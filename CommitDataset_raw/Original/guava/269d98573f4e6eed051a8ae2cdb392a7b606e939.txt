Fixed isAssignableFrom() for <? super T> wildcard types, as pointed out by Guava issue 1898.

In a nutshell, here's what we have in the current implementation:

List<? super String>.isAssignableFrom(List<Object>) == true // Correct
<? super CharSequence>.isAssignableFrom(String) == false // Wrong!
<? super String>.isAssignableFrom(<Object>) == true // Wrong! Not assignable

To show why they are wrong, consider the following three code snippets where the first two compile and the third doesn't compile:

void okay(Receiver<List<? super String>> receiver, List<Object> objects) {
receiver.accept(objects);
}

void okay2(Receiver<? super CharSequence> receiver) {
receiver.accept("1");
}

void notOkay(Receiver<? super String> receiver, Object obj) {
receiver.accept(obj);
}
