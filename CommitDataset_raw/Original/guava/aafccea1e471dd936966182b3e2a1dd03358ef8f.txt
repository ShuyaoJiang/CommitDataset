Don't use ImmutableSet.of() for the keySet of ImmutableMap.of().

The keySet of the empty map will still be a singleton (since the empty map is a singleton and it caches keySet), it'll just be a different singleton from ImmutableSet.of().  This ensures that the only implementation of ImmutableSet retained by usages of ImmutableMap are its own keySet implementations.
