Add tests:
- map.put(presentKey, value)
- entry.setValue

Fixes https://github.com/google/guava/issues/2406

Make classes support entry.setValue:
- CompactHashMap
- LocalCache
  - Support was removed in [] and I'm not sure why.
  - The private documentation still claims that it's supported.
  - A test (that I edit in this CL) checks that it's not, but presumably only because it was copied from a test that looked for the old behavior and thus needed to be updated: http://[] | []
