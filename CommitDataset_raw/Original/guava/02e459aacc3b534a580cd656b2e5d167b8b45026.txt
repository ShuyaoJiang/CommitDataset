Reconcile @GwtIncompatible (and @GoogleInternal) annotations with the build-system lists of GWT-compatible (and GWT-compatible emulated) files.
The main effect of this is to make InternetDomainName available under GWT in Guava. (It somehow seems to have worked anyway inside Google.) http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/issues/detail?id=1253
It's also necessary to make UnsignedInteger.multiply() (which is already deprecated) unavailable under GWT, since it is a simple passthrough to the times() method, which is also unavailable under GWT.
