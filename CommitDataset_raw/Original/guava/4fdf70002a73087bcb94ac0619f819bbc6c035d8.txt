@Beta release of MapMaker.maximumSize()!

Add Interners.asFunction per issue 398.
	
Start emulating ImmutableAsList, and make it GWT serializable.

Add missing Javadoc to Maps.EntryTransformer.transformEntry().
	
Since ConcurrentHashMap consistently invokes equals() as
"objectYouJustGaveMe.equals(objectAlreadyInMap)", it was suggested we should do
the same with our equivalences.
	
Various small doc fixes.
