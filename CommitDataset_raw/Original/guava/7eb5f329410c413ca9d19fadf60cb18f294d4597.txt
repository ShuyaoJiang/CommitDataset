Get rid of usages of TestUtil from common.io test classes and open source most of FilesTest.

This includes several changes:

1. Replacing the use of TestUtil.getSrcDir() to get at resources in the testdata package as Files. This is handled by creating a File from the URL path directly if it's a file:// URL and copying the resources to a temp dir on demand if it's not.
2. Replacing the use of TestUtil.getTmpDirFile() with a temp dir created in a manner similar to Files.createTempDir(). Also, IoTestCase's tearDown() should ensure that any temp dirs/files created during tests are deleted afterwards.
3. Changing some file paths in FilesTest to be built dynamically from their parts so as to hopefully work correctly on Windows as well as Unix systems. For example, instead of "/foo/bar", file(root(), "foo", "bar").
4. Fixing a few things with the testdata resources in the BUILD file.
