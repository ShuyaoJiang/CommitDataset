Change the HostAndPort.java to support case like "hostname:"
Here's the string does include a ":" but does not have the port number, before this CL, HostAndPort.java tries to parse the empty string after ":" to a number and throws a NumberFormatException.
In this case, it should treat the port is undefined instead.
