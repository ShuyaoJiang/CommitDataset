Remove @Beta from APIs:

collect
- most Collectors (aside from BloomFilter and ImmutableRange*, as those whole classes are @Beta (though I did remove the redundant @Beta annotation from the Collector-returning methods for clarity))
- Maps: asConverter, immutableEnumMap
- MultimapBuilder
- Streams: stream(Iterable), concat

io
- ByteStreams: copy, toByteArray
- CharStreams: copy, toString
- Files: as(Char|Byte)(Source|Sink)

util.concurrent
- Futures: addCallback, getDone, getUnchecked, immediateCancelledFuture, immediateFailedFuture, immediateFuture
- ListeningScheduledExecutorService
- Uninterruptibles

other
- HtmlEscapers
- Splitter.splitToList
- Ticker
