Assorted util.concurrent tweaks, mostly Javadoc.
- @link from CheckedFuture to common implementations, since it seems that many people can't find them: https://groups.google.com/a/google.com/group/java-libraries-discuss/browse_thread/thread/83589a60aa3c5318
- Warn that makeListenable(...).addListener() and friends use a thread.
- Add examples to Futures.combine.
- Rewrite the Javadoc for some methods in Futures to cram more information into the first sentence.
- Also, stop extending Assert in ListenableFutureTester in favor of static imports.
- Finally, make combine(..., Iterable) more permissive. (This should be backward compatible.)
