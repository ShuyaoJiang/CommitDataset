Delete SingletonImmutableList.

While SingletonImmutableList allocates one fewer object, this isn't worth it on Android.  This has no effect on the MemoryTester bounds for ImmutableList itself.

Currently we are deleting it in all environments, but if we liked we could delete it only in Android; its deletion does increase the MemoryTester bounds for e.g. ImmutableListMultimap, whose "sparse" configuration generates a singleton ImmutableList per key.
