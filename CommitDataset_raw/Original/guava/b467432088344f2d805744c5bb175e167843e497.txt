Stop ignoring http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6533203 in iterators now that the bug has been fixed in GWT for a while and the JDK for even longer.
(This is like CL 57745078 but for a different bug.)
Also, go a step further, and remove support entirely for ignoring both bugs.

This is safe to submit now that we require a version of GWT with the bug fix (2.8.0, though 2.7.0 would have been good enough).
