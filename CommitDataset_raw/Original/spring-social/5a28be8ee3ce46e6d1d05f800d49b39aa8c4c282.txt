Implemented OAuth1Template to use S2OAuth's CoreOAuthConsumerSupport. Note that I also had to make some minor changes to CoreOAuthConsumerSupport to be able to use it outside of S2OAuth's framework support. At the time of this commit, those changes have not yet been merged into the S2OAuth master, nor are they a part of the latest snapshot build.
