Use InterceptingRestTemplate in templates to mimic how InterceptingHttpAccessor works in Spring 3.1 (albeit, as a subclass rather than as a parent class). This makes it possible for the tests to replace the request factory with a mock server request factory and still have it wrapped with an intercepting request factory.
