Updating the redirectToProvider() method to use a relative redirect rather than absolute - if ConnectController isn't at the root (e.g. in /foo) it seems to sometimes still redirect to /connect rather than /foo/connect (debugging showed that request.getContextPath() was coming up empty sometimes, and as a result a relativel redirect was not done).
