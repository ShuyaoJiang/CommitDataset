Initial work to transition connect package from Greenhouse to Spring Social. Removed findAccountByConnection() and findMembersConnectedTo() in the process to remove dependency on account package. These will need to be accounted for in Greenhouse code once Greenhouse starts using Spring Social's connect package.
