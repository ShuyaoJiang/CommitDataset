2.x: operator tests unsubscribeOn, withLatestFrom, zip (partial)

+ fixed cancellation behavior of observeOn, subscribeOn and
unsubscribeOn (when and what to call cancel on)
+ fixed infinite loop in ScheduledRunnable
+ fixed zip not quitting eagerly if one of the sources was shorter
+ added specific ZipIterable because zip-iterable tests expect it to be
not prefetching any of the sources (the plain zip does prefetch)
+ made the fromIterable more resilient to Iterable/Iterator crashes and
added null-value checks
