Fix Zip race condition

ItemObserver onNext might not acquire the write lock due to an
onCompleted being handled by another thread. When handling
onCompleted, the ItemObserver does not check for any values that are
ready to be emitted, which might cause OperationZip to never emit
OnNext or OnCompleted.
