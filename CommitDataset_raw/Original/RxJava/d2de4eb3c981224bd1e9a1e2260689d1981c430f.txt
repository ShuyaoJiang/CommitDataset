2.x: classes Single and NbpObservable

`Single` is a deferred single-value emitting Observable.

`NbpObservable` is the non-backpressure Observable, named this way until
the main Observable gets all its tests ported so a refactor can deal
with all of them.

I've implemented the most basic construction and operator methods on
them.
