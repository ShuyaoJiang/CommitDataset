2.x: operator test for groupBy; fix to groupBy and type argument swap
for GroupedObservable

+ added BooleanSubscription to detect cancellation without caring about
requests.

I'm still not 100% convinced the groupBy request coordination works
properly (i.e., no stall due lack of requests from one of the groups).
