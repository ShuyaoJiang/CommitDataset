Unsubscribe behavior.

Adding correct unsubscribe behavior to the example so it models what real implementations should be doing.
Also added comments around the synchronous observable to make clear that it 'firehoses' and will not unsubscribe regardless of a take operator saying it wants less than the 50 it will send.
