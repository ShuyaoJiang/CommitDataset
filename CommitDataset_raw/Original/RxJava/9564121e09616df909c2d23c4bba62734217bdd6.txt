Check isDisposed before emitting in SingleFromCallable (#5743)

Previously SingleFromCallable did not check if the subscriber was
unsubscribed before emitting onSuccess or onError. This fixes that
behavior and adds tests to SingleFromCallable, CompletableFromCallable,
and MaybeFromCallable.

Fixes #5742
