Restoring null check removed in recent commit

See https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/commit/caf3a9434ed4b3b4efba6661891f02417aebf604 for removal

It started causing this unit test to fail:

rx.operators.OperationZip$UnitTest > testAggregatorUnsubscribe FAILED
    java.lang.NullPointerException at OperationZip.java:611

Not sure how I missed it when I reviewed the previous commit â€¦ but I did.
