GroupBy unsubscribe logic

- support unsubscribing from parent and/or child
- The following is now possible:

```
groupBy().take(1).mapMany(group -> group.take(20))
```

- the subscription on the parent will cause new groups to stop being sent, but it will keep sending events until all previously created groups are unsubscribed from
