Change Interval and Sample default Scheduler

Change to use built-in thread-pools rather than creating a new Executor on each invocation.
The built-in ones are shared across all operators, have threads ready, are marked as daemon threads so don't prevent system shutdown, and are named for clarity when looking at thread dumps and debuggers.
