Implement LambdaConsumerIntrospection (#5590)

* Implement HasDefaultErrorConsumer

Followup from #5569, and allows you to introspect if the resulting observer has missing error consumption and subsequently supplies a default (throwing) one.

* Add `@since`

* Add tests

* Add support in relevant completable observers

* Add support in ConsumerSingleObserver

* Add support in MaybeCallbackObserverTest

* Add support in LambdaSubscriber

* Switch to CompositeObserver and onErrorImplemented()

* Update wording to use Introspection

* Update tests and flip implementation logic to match naming
