Operator window with boundary (exact, selector, exact + supplier).

I'm not 100% certain about the state management: when to let the main
source keep running and when to stop. I.e., the in the selector version,
if the other completes, it means no new window will be opened but the
active should keep receiving values until their closer fires. If all
such closers have fired, the main can be stopped.
