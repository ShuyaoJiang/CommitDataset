Handle OnSubscribeFuncs correctly in JRuby interop logic

OnSubscribeFunc#onSubscribe expects to return a Subscription. I am
unable to successfully cast the return value of a RubyProc, even if
that value _is_ an object that implements the Subscription interface,
into a Subscription in Java-land (Java reports that ConcreteJavaProxy
cannot be cast). Instead I allow JRuby to handle OnSubscribeFunc
arguments through its default proxy logic, which works correctly.
