Remove assertTrustedObservable

- Was no longer working once onError(Exception) changed to onError(Throwable) as the assertions throwing java.lang.Error no longer bypassed the composed Observables.
- It was confusing while locally contextual JUnit verifications as used everywhere else are clear, readable and localized to each test
