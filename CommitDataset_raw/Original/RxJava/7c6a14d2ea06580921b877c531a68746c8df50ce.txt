Tweaks to Executor/ExecutorScheduler/IOScheduler and Javadocs

- added Javadocs
- moved some classes to package-private until they are proven necessary for the public API
- made ExecutorScheduler support Executor implementations and still work with time delays by using a system-wide scheduler/timer
- made IO thread-pool unbounded with a cached thread pool
