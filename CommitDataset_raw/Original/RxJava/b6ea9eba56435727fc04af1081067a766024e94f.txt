2.x: operators cast and concat tests

The concat reuses the same inner subscriber to save on its allocation
cost which works only if the inner source conforms with the spec and
doesn't emit any event after an onComplete(). There is a test that
explicitly calls onComplete() twice to test the resilience of concat.
The current workaround makes this test pass but any async non-conforming
source may still bug out the operator. 

This is a tradeoff between safety and performance. If we'd expect such
non-conforming behavior, the current optimization has to be turned into
a regular individually allocated inner subscribers.
