Operator Scan Backpressure Fix

Problem 1) The initial value was being emitted before subscription which caused issues with request/producer state, particularly if filter() was used to skip that initial value and then called request(1) before the real request had been sent.
Problem 2) The initial value was not accounted for by the request so it was sending 1 more value than requested. It now modifies the request to account for it.
Problem 3) Redo relied upon these nuances to work. I've fixed this by using a simpler implementation that just maintains state within a map function.
