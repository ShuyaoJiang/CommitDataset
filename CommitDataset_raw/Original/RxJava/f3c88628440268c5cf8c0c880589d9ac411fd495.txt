Update DESIGN.md (#6033)

I've just read the DESIGN.md and noticed some things that I could do to improve the quality of the DESIGN.md. So as a result of my "proofreading" I mainly:
- Added periods at the ending of some sentences.
- Did case matching of certain types and terms. e.g. `OnSubscribe` -> `onSubscribe` OR flowable -> `Flowable`.

Hope it helps! :smile:
