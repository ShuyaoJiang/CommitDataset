synchronization and contract refactoring

No longer will synchronization ever be added automatically. If synchronization is needed then the synchronize() operator should be used.
The AtomicObserver is added to Observables (but not internally trusted ones) to ensure compliance with the Rx contract and auto-unsubscribe. This should generally mean just 1 wrapper at the top of a sequence chain.
These changes are based on a discussion with Erik about how Rx 2.0 works in .Net.
