Better handling of map function errors

- Stop catching the error and passing to onError and instead let the SafeObserver handle it which will then prevent subsequent onNext calls and/or unsubscribe when a failure occurs.
- This also solves the OnErrorResumeNext issue fixed in https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/pull/312 but those changes still seem valid so I'll leave them.
