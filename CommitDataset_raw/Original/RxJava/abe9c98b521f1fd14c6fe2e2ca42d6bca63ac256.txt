Increasing Unit Test Timeout for Slow Machines

- Increasing timeout by a lot to handle slow machines such as this: https://netflixoss.ci.cloudbees.com/job/RxJava-pull-requests/629/testReport/junit/rx.schedulers/ExecutorSchedulerTests/recursionUsingFunc2/
- The timeout is only there if a deadlock or memory leak occurs (which is what this PR is fixing) so when everything is healthy it does not timeout
