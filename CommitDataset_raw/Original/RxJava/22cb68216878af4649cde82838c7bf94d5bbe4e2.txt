Common approach for IllegalArgumentException on subscribe methods

As brought up in https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/issues/278 there were inconsistencies in how arguments were being validated on subscribe methods.

All arguments to subscribe are now validated correctly at the beginning of method invocation and IllegalArgumentException thrown if null arguments are injected.

According to Rx Guideline 6.5 a null argument is considered "a catastrophic error occurs that should bring down the whole program anyway" and thus we immediately throw. A null argument should be caught immediately in development and has nothing to do with subscribe invocation which is what guideline 6.5 is talking about (since a null Observer can't have onError called on it anyways).
