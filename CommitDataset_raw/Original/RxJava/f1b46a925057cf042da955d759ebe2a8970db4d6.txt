GroupBy Fixes

- There were bugs in the implementation, this fixes some of them. In particular, it was unsubscribing from the parent when all children were completed, and that would unsubscribe even if new groups were going to come.
- There are still problems related to `subscribeOn` and the "time gap" that are being played with. Unit tests related to that are still failing.
