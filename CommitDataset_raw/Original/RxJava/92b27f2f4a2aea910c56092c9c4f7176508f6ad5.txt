RxJavaPlugins performance enabling fix & lockdown.

By using null checks and direct returns we can avoid a dynamic dispatch
on a volatile variable which always more expensive.

I've also added the `lockdown()` method to prevent any further changing
of the plugin handlers. There is a `unlock` package-private method to
allow testing the plugin in the locked state and then return to the
unlocked state as other tests may want to install custom plugins.
