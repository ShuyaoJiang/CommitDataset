2.x: operator test: skip variants and bugfix

Note that since we know have time unit in schedulers, one must be
careful with the time unit of the timed skip operators. The timestamps
will be calculated via this unit and may not return the expected values. 

For example, a skipLast of 1 second will not skip the value 0.5 seconds
before completion because its timestamp is rounded down to the start of
the second. But if one uses 1000 milliseconds, the value will be
skipped.
