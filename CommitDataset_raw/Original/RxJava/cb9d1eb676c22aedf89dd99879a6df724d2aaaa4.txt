single: add toSingle method to Observable

* closes ReactiveX/RxJava#3038
* this method allows an observable which is guaranteed to return exactly one
  item to be converted to a Single
* NOTE: the semantics of this function are very similar to that of single
* i.e. errors are passed through, more than one item results in an
  IllegalArgumentException, completion without emission results in a
  NoSuchElementException and exactly one item is passed through the onSuccess
  method of SingleSubscriber
