Change in wiki page from "Mathematical Operators" to "Mathematical and Aggregate Operators"
move toList, reduce, concat, toSortedList, toMap, and toMultiMap to that page
deprecate aggregate in favor of reduce
[should I move takeLast, last, and takeLastBuffer to the Aggregate operators page? they don't operate on the aggregate, exactly, but they do wait until the source completes before emitting anything]
