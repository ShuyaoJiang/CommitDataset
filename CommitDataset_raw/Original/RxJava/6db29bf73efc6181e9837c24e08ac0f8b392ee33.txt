migrate unit tests for Groovy to separate Groovy file

- testing all Groovy functionality doesn't belong as an inner class
- it was awkard to load Groovy scripts via Java (leftover from previous codebase where Groovy wasn't part of build, only a runtime library)
- establish convention for each language to have a suite of tests in /src/test
