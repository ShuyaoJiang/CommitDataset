Fix bug in CompositeException.getRootCause (#6380)

* Fix bug in CompositeException.getRootCause 

The original code use to be `if (root == null || root == e)`, but apparently after some refactoring it ended up as `if (root == null || cause == root)`, which I believe is a bug.

This method should probably be `static` (that would have prevented the bug).

* Update unit tests for CompositeException.getRootCause
