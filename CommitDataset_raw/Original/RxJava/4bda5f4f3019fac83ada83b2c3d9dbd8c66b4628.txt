Introduced 'rxjava-scalaz' project.  This project provides some type class instances for Observable.

* Monoid: Observable obviously forms a monoid in terms of concatenation.
* Functor, Applicative, Monad, MonadPlus: Observable can be a Stream-like Monad and can be MonadPlus as well as Monoid.
* Traverse, Foldable: Observable can be Stream-like traversable. __NOTE: The operations for the instance is blocking calls.__
* etc.

About Testing, property based tests are applied by Scalaz's ScalaCheck binding.

For QuickStart, please refer to rx.java.scala.scalaz.examples.RxScalazDemo.
