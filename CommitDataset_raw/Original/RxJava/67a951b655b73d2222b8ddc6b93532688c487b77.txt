Improve doOnDispose JavaDoc (#5296)

* correct javadoc note in Observable.doOnDispose()

The note was claiming Observable.doOnDispose() would be called for
terminal events of the Observable, which is not the case

* small improvement to .doOnDispose javadocs to refer to Actions

* add @throws mentions to doOnDisposed javadocs
