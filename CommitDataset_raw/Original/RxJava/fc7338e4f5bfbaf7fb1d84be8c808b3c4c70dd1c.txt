2.x: operator test: retry, retryWhen

+ retry with bipredicate
+ fixed map not checking the returned value for null
+ since RS doesn't allow throwing other than NPE, temporarily subscribe
and lift will throw NPE with the actual error as cause so we don't miss
an operator bug due to swallowed exceptions.
