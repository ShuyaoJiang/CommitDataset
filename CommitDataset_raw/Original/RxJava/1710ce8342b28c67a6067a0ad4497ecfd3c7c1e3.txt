How to create and destroy streams.

The wording of this can become much better once agreement occurs in https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/pull/3348/files

2) Evolve towards what the creation/generation APIs are
3) Specify that it is not the responsibility of the final Subscriber to call unsubscribe/cancel upstream
