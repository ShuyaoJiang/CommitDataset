Update SerializedObserver to Not Allow Notification Delay

Unit test showing delays. Fails when MAX_DRAIN_ITERATION set to 1, passes as currently configured.
Added a thread starvation unit test and marked as ignored for now. Doesn't pass even with MAX_DRAIN_ITERATION set to 1. Probably needs backpressure solution.
