Scheduler.scheduleRecursive

Make recursive scheduling a first-class citizen without needing to refer to "this" which doesn't work inside lambdas (Java8/Scala/etc).

        Schedulers.newThread().scheduleRecursive(new Action1<Recurse>() {
            @Override
            public void call(Recurse r) {
                System.out.println("do stuff on thread: " + Thread.currentThread() + " Time: " + System.nanoTime());
                r.schedule(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
            }
        });
