A number of improvements to OperatorObserveFromAndroidComponent

- move the UI thread assert out of the operator and into the helpers; this way, we don't fail the observer anymore with an exception, but the caller.
- do not loop unsubscribe through the main thread anymore. This unnecessarily defers releasing the references, and might in fact be processed only after Android creates the component after a rotation change. I had to make the references volatile for this to work.
- immediately unsubscribe in case we detect the componentRef has become invalid. This solves the problem that dangling observers would continue to listen to notifications with no observer alive anymore.
