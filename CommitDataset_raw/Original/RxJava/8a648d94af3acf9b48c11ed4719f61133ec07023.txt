Use Object as argument type for fromFragment helper

This is to prevent compilation failures in projects that do not link the support-v4 library. The only other option I saw to fix this would have been to split up the android module into one for native fragments and one for support fragments, which I found would come with unjustified overhead. Hence I settled for the cheap way, which is to sacrifice type safety here.
