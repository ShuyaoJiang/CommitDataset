Refactoring towards performance improvements

- Convert operators to implement Func1 instead of extend Observable
- Change Observable to concete instead of abstract
- subscribe is now controlled by the concrete class so we can control the wrapping of a Func to be executed when subscribe is called
- removed most wrapping inside operators with AtomicObservable except for complex operators like Zip that appear to still need it

While doing these changes the util/function packages got moved a little as well to make more sense for where the Atomic* classes should go
