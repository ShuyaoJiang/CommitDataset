Fix PublishSubject non-deterministic behavior on concurrent modification

- changed to take snapshot of observers.values() before iterating in onNext/onError/onCompleted so that nested subscriptions that add to observers can't change the values() iteration
- single-threaded nested subscriptions are now deterministic
- multi-threaded subscriptions will no longer be allowed to race to get into an interating onNext/onError/onCompleted loop, they will always wait until the next
- also improved terminal state behavior when subscribing to a PublishSubject that has already received onError/onCompleted
