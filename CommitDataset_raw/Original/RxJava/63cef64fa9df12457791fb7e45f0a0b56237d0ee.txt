Small reorganization of code for OperationTake and TrustedObservableTester

- removed rx.testing package (if that's going to exist that means it's bleeding into something that should live in /src/test and beyond what works well for inner class testing)
- made TrustedObservableTester part of rx.operation package and an inner UnitTest class so it doesn't become part of the public API
