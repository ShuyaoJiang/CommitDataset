Reimplementation of Concat, improved handling of Observable<Observable<T>>.

The old version required all of the Observable<T>s to be generated and buffered
before the concat could begin.  If the outer Observable was asynchronous, items
could be dropped (test added).  The new version passes the test, and does the
best job I could (after examining several possible strategies) of achieving
clear and consistent semantics in accordance with the principle of least
surprise.
