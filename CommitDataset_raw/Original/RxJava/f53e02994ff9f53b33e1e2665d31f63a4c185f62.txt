2.x: Add scheduler creation factories (#5002)

* Add scheduler creation factories

Resolves #4993

This is a pretty vanilla copy from RxJava 1's implementation. Note that I had to tune NewThread scheduler to not be a singleton to support this.

We had talked about borrowing from project reactor's APIs for different overloads, let me know if you think we should add more fine-grained controls through these.

* Add `@since` info

* Change failure string to "is null"

* Move to RxJavaPlugins

* Remove no-arg overloads

* Rename to make it clearer about creation

Added scheduler because we're not in Scheduler anymore. Changed to "create" because "newNewThread" was weird

* Add tests (WIP)

* Remove unnecessary nullcheck

* Remove double try

* Fix tests, make them more robust with integration flow

* Shut down custom schedulers when done
