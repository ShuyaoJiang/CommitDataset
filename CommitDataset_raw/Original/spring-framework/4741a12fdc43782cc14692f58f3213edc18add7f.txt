Support for transactional event listener

Update the application event listener infrastructure to support events
that are processed according to a transactional phase.

Introduce EventListenerFactory that can be implemented to provide support
for additional event listener types. TransactionalEventListener is a new
annotation that can be used in lieu of the regular EventListener. Its
related factory implementation is registered in the context automatically
via @EnableTransactionManagement or <tx:annotation-driven/>

By default, a TransactionalEventListener is invoked when the transaction
has completed successfully (i.e. AFTER_COMMIT). Additional phases are
provided to handle BEFORE_COMMIT and AFTER_ROLLBACK events.

If no transaction is running, such listener is not invoked at all unless
the `fallbackExecution` flag has been explicitly set.
