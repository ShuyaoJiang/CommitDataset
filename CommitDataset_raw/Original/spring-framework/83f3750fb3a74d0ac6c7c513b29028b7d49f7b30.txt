Support byte[] in JaxbMarshaller under JDK 7

JDK7 changed its reflections API in order to resolve
http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=5041784

In short, JDK 5 and 6 (wrongly) return GenericArrayTypes in certain
reflection scenarios, whereas JDK 7 changed this to return a normal
array type. For Jaxb2Marshaller, this meant that marshaling byte arrays
was not supported under JDK 7.

This change fixes that, so that Jaxb2Marhsaller supports marshalling
byte arrays again (under JDK 5, 6 or 7).
