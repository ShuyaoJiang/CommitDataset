Support abstract, bridge, & interface methods in AnnotatedElementUtils

This commit introduces support for finding annotations on abstract,
bridge, and interface methods in AnnotatedElementUtils.

 - Introduced dedicated findAnnotationAttributes() methods in
   AnnotatedElementUtils that provide first-class support for
   processing methods, class hierarchies, interfaces, bridge methods,
   etc.

 - Introduced find/get search algorithm dichotomy in
   AnnotatedElementUtils which is visible in the public API as well as
   in the internal implementation. This was necessary in order to
   maintain backwards compatibility with the existing API (even though
   it was undocumented).

 - Reverted all recent changes made to the "get semantics" search
   algorithm in AnnotatedElementUtils in order to ensure backwards
   compatibility, and reverted recent changes to
   JtaTransactionAnnotationParser and SpringTransactionAnnotationParser
   accordingly.

 - Documented internal AnnotatedElementUtils.Processor<T> interface.

 - Enabled failing tests and introduced
   findAnnotationAttributesFromBridgeMethod() test in
   AnnotatedElementUtilsTests.

 - Refactored ApplicationListenerMethodAdapter.getCondition() and
   enabled failing test in TransactionalEventListenerTests.

 - AnnotationUtils.isInterfaceWithAnnotatedMethods() is now package
   private.
