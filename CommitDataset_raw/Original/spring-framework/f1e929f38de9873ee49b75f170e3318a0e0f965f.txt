Added websocket upgrade support for GlassFish 4.0

Commit 2397b21096ad1c184d9f22629f74a6c44a9ba923 changed websocket
support to use GlassFish 4.0.1 nightlies, but broke support for 4.0. In
GlassFish 4.0.1, the package that TyrusEndpoint is located in changed.
This commit provides an abstract handler that does all required
GlassFish setup, but delegates to version specific upgrade handlers to
create the final TyrusEndpoint.

GlassFish 4.0 handler uses reflection to create its endpoint to prevent
dependency issues of depending on different versions of
tyrus-websocket-core and tyrus-container-servlet
