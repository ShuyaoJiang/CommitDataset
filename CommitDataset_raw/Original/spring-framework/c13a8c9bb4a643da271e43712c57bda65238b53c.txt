DispatcherHandler maps errors to ResponseStatusException

The DispatcherHandler now has an errorMapper property that is a
function for transforming errors. By default this property is set to an
instance of DispatcherHandlerExceptionMapper which wraps "standard"
framework exceptions and @ResponseStatus-annotated exceptions as
ResponseStatusException.

This makes it easy to handle the exceptions downstream uniformly.
