Refactor codecs

This commit introduces the following changes:
 - MessageToByteEncoder/Decoder renamed to Encoder/Decoder
 - JsonObjectEncoder/Decoder are now used directly in
   JacksonJsonEncoder/Decoder
 - Codec uses MimeType instead of MediaType since they
   are not specific to HTTP
 - Default MimeType are now managed thanks to
   Encoder/Decoder#getSupportedMimeTypes()
 - AbstractEncoder/Decoder takes care of generic MimeType related behavior
