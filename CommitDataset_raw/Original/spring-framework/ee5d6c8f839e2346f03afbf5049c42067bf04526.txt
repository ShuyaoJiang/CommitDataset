Exclude null requestURI in MHSR.getRequestURL()

This commit undoes the changes made in ec5d81e78e and ensures that the
getRequestURL() method in MockHttpServletRequest does not include the
String "null" for a null requestURI by first checking if the requestURI
contains text before including it in the composed URL.
