Improve CORS handling in AbstractSockJsService

After this change, AbstractSockJsService does not add CORS headers if
the response already contains an "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" header.
Essentially it backs off assuming CORS headers are handled centrally
e.g. through a Filter.

In order to support this, the ServletServerHttpResponse now returns an
instance of HttpHeaders that also provides access to headers already
present in the HttpServletResponse.
