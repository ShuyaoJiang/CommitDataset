Properly document avoiding false positives when testing with JPA

Prior to this commit, information regarding avoiding false positives
when testing with JPA had already been added to the Testing chapter of
the reference manual. However, the example did not work properly and
the accompanying text mixed concepts from Hibernate and JPA.

This commit fixes the @Autowired/@PersistenceContext bug, updates the
text, and marks each test as @Transactional in order to avoid any
misinterpretation.
