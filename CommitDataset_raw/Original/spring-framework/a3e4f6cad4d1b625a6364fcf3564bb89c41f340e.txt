Use EasyMock 2.5.2 consistently across the build

This commit ensures that EasyMock version 2.5.2 is used consistently
across the test suite. This applies to both the easymock and
easymockclassextension artifacts. Using the same version for both of
these artifacts helps to better align us for a future upgrade to
EasyMock 3.0 since the Class Extension artifact is deprecated in 3.x
releases of the library.
