Include response headers in RestTemplate exceptions

Default HTTP error exceptions thrown from RestTemplate now include
response headers in addition to the response body. In particular, this
enables inspection of the Content-Type header allowing manual
deserialization of the response body without guessing as to the content
type.

 - introduce HttpStatusCodeException#getResponseHeaders
 - add constructor with headers param for HttpStatusCodeException,
   HttpClientErrorException and HttpServerErrorException
 - preserve exsisting constructor signatures
 - mark HttpHeaders as Serializable
 - generate new serialVersionUID where needed
