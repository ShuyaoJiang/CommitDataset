Make CommandLinePropertySource enumerable

JOpt 4.4 has enumerable options, so this change can be made
if we upgrade. The only awkward thing is that JOpt allows
aliases for options, so we have to pick one to avoid double
counting. This implementation picks the last one in the list
which is the alphebtically last of the long options, if there
are any (e.g. "o1", "option1" returns "option1"). Most of the
time there will only be one or two aliases for each option so
it won't matter.
