Use .setStatus in ResponseStatusExceptionResolver

Before this change ResponseStatusExceptionResolver always used
.sendError despite the javadoc on @ResponseStatus#code. This was
perhaps justifiable from a HandlerExceptionResolver. Nevertheless
.setStatus should be more REST API friendly while still marking
the response as an error.
