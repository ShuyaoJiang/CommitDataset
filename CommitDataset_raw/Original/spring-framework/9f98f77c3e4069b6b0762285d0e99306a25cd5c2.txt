SPR-8863 Add RequestContext.getPathToServlet() method.

This method allows a view to access the combined context path and
servlet mapping path for prefixing URLs without having to specify
the literal part of a servlet mapping such as "/main/*") 
explicitly everywhere. For example:

${requestContext.pathToServlet}/css/main.css
