Fix regression in static setter method support

The intention of ExtendedBeanInfo, introduced with SPR-8079 in
v3.1.0.M2, was to support dependency injection against non-void
returning write methods. However, it also inadvertently introduced
support for injection against static setter methods.

When use of ExtendedBeanInfo was made optional with SPR-9723 in
v3.2.0.M2, ExtendedBeanInfo continued to support static write methods,
but its new BeanInfoFactory-based approach to testing whether or not
a given bean class contains candidate write methods was written in a
fashion exclusive of static methods, and this thereby introduced a
regression - a regression in an otherwise undocumented and unintended
feature, but a regression nevertheless.

The reporting of SPR-10115 proves that at least one user has come to
depend on this behavior allowing injection against static write
methods, and so this commit fixes the regression by ensuring that the
candidacy test includes standard and non-void setter methods having a
static modifier.
