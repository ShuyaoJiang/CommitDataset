Support ResolvableTypeProvider on simple event pojo

Previously, the generic type of a simple pojo event implementing
ResolvableTypeProvider wasn't detected properly. This commit fixes the
logic when the generic type is not provided to reuse what
PayloadApplicationEvent is already doing anyway.

Issue: SPR-14029
