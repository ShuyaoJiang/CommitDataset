Predict specific object type in EhCacheFactoryBean

Prior to this change, before a bean is created by EhCacheFactoryBean,
its #getObjectType would return only an Ehcache interface. This caused
unwanted wiring issues as described in the related JIRA issue.

This fix makes use of EhCacheFactoryBean's configuration to determine
the specific Ehcache object type even before it's created, such that
the container is provided with as much information as possible when
resolving dependencies. Nevertheless, users are advised to code to
the Ehcache interface.
