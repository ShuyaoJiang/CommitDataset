What's new and migrating are prominently featured

Before this commit those were burried in the Appendix where few would
guess to look. Previously that information was at the top, so it makes
sense to point to the Github wiki from the index HTML page.

Also a general update of the index page. Since we have recently revised
the overview, we can simply point to it and keep it shorter.

The section listing now includes more details per section.
