Document lifecycle issue  with JNDI-based beans

When a bean is retrieved via JNDI using Java config, we apply the same
inferred more for destruction callbacks as for any other bean. If an
object from the JNDI tree has a `close` or `shutdown` method, the
context calls it when it shutdowns.

Unfortunately, we have no way to know that the bean was retrieved via
JNDI and that its lifecycle is managed outside the application.

The documentation has been updated to reflect that problem explicitly.

Issue: SPR-12551
