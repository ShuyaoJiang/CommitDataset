Enhance ParameterizableViewController

This change two new capabilities to ParameterizableViewController:

 - configure a View instance (in addition to view name)
 - configure response status code

The status code may be useful to send a 404 while also writing to the
body using a view.

The status code may also be used to override the redirect status code
of RedirectView. Even today it's possible to configure a "redirect:"
prefixed view name but the status code could not be selected. When a
3xx status is set, the code is passed on to the RedirectView while the
view name is automatically prefixed with "redirect:" (if not already).

For full control over RedirectView it is now also possible to
parameterize the controller with a View instance.

As one more possible resulting variation, given status 204 and no view
the request is considered handled (controller returns null).

This change is preparation for SPR-11543.
