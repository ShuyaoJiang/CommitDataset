Support repeatable annotations as composed annotations

Prior to this commit, AnnotationUtils supported searching for
repeatable annotations even if the repeatable annotation was declared
on a custom stereotype annotation. However, there was no support for
merging of attributes in composed repeatable annotations. In other
words, it was not possible for a custom annotation to override
attributes in a repeatable annotation.

This commit addresses this by introducing
findMergedRepeatableAnnotations() methods in AnnotatedElementUtils.
These new methods provide full support for explicit annotation
attribute overrides configured via @AliasFor (as well as
convention-based overrides) with "find semantics".
