Fix path matching for paths containing spaces

Prior to this commit, the latest optimizations introduced in SPR-13913
would prevent matching when patterns contained spaces. Indeed, the
optimized path would not fully tokenize the paths nor trim the tokens,
as the "longer" code path does.

This commit disables this optimized path when the `trimTokens` option is
set to `true`.

Also, the `trimTokens` setting is now set to `false` by default.

Issue: SPR-14247
