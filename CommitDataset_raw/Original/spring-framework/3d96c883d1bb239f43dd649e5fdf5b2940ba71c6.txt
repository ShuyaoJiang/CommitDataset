Cache lookup path in ResourceUrlEncodingFilter

Commit https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/2b97d6
introduced a change where the path within the DispatcherServlet is
determined with each call to ResourceUrlProvider.getForRequestUrl.

To avoid repeating that every time a URL is encoded through the
response, we now cache the result of the lookupPath determination in
ResourceUrlEncodingFilter.
