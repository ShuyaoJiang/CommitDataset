Fix APC registration for @EnableTransactionManagement

Prior to this change, @EnableTransactionManagement (via the
ProxyTransactionManagementConfiguration class) did not properly
register its auto-proxy creator through the usual AopConfigUtils
methods.  It was trying to register the APC as a normal @Bean method,
but this causes issues (SPR-8494) with the logic in
AopConfigUtils#registerOrEscalateApcAsRequired, which expects the APC
bean definition to have a beanClassName property.  When the APC is
registered via a @Bean definition, it is actually a
factoryBean/factoryMethod situation with no directly resolvable
beanClass/beanClassName.

Rather than trying to rework how AopConfigUtils works, a @PostConstruct
method has been added to ProxyTransactionManagementConfiguration to call
the usual AopConfigUtils registration methods.

Issue: SPR-8411, SPR-8494
