Support byte ranges in ResourceHttpRequestHandler

This commit introduces support for HTTP byte ranges in the
ResourceHttpRequestHandler. This support consists of a number of
changes:

- Parsing of HTTP Range headers in HttpHeaders, using a new HttpRange
  class and inner ByteRange/SuffixByteRange subclasses.
- MIME boundary generation moved from FormHttpMessageConverter to
  MimeTypeUtils.
- writePartialContent() method introduced in ResourceHttpRequestHandler,
  handling the byte range logic
- Additional partial content tests added to
  ResourceHttpRequestHandlerTests.

Issue: SPR-10805
