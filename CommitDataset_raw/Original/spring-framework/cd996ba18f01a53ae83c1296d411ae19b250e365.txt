Upgrading to JDK 1.8 bytecode along with ASM 4.1 patch

ASM has been patched to accept 1.8 bytecode simply through removing an assertion. As a consequence, we have an embedded copy of the ASM sources now instead of jarjar'ing the original ASM jar. The sources originate from ASM 4.1; for CGLIB 3.0 compatibility, a further assertion has been removed.

Issue: SPR-9639
