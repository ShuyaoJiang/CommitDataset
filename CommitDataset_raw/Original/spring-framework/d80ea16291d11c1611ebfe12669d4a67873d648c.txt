Fix JasperReport tests to ignore missing fonts

Add 'jasperreports.properties' to ignore missing fonts in order that
tests pass on Linux.

The upgraded JasperReports 5.0.4 throws a JRFontNotFoundException when
a report font is not found. This caused Spring MVC tests to fail since
the example reports used the 'Arial' font which is not shipped with most
Linux distributions.

An alternative fix would have been to package fonts with the reports
using JasperReports font extension support.
