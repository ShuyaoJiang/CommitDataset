Overhaul contributing guidelines

The guidelines were originally created several years ago. This commit
does not fundamentally change anything but rather make the guidance
more compact.

The commit consolidates into into CONTRIBUTING.adoc information from
CONTRIBUTING-DOCUMENTATION.adoc and also the wiki page "The Lifecycle
of an Issue".
