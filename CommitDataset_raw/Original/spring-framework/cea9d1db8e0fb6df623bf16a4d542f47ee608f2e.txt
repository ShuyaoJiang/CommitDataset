Fix Spring Framework BOM

This commit reinstates the Spring Framework BOM, which was previously
empty because of a previous change in 41cbc4670f.
This change also removes the JSR305 dependency from the BOM, which does
not belong here since it is not an artifact produced by Spring.

Issue: SPR-15885
