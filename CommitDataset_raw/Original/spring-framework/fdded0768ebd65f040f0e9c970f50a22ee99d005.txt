Upgrade slf4j-api and -log4j12 dependencies to 1.6.1

Previously depending on 1.5.10 in certain locations, which caused
NoClassDefFoundErrors in EhCacheCacheTests and other tests due to
mismatches between slf4j -api and -log4j12 versions.

With the exception of one transitive dependency via Hibernate 3.3.1.GA,
all slf4j dependencies are now pegged at 1.6.1 (and all tests pass).
