Introduce ExtendedBeanInfo

Decorator for instances returned from
Introspector#getBeanInfo(Class<?>) that supports detection and inclusion
of non-void returning setter methods. Fully supports indexed properties
and otherwise faithfully mimics the default
BeanInfo#getPropertyDescriptors() behavior, e.g., PropertyDescriptor
ordering, etc.

This decorator has been integrated with CachedIntrospectionResults
meaning that, in simple terms, the Spring container now supports
injection of setter methods having any return type.
