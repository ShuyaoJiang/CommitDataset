Limit auto grow collection size when using SpEL

Provide an additional constructor on SpelParserConfiguration that can
be used to limit the maximum size that a collection will auto grow when
being accessed via a SpEL expression.

This constraint is particularly useful when SpEL is used with data
binding as it prevents a malicious user from crafting a request that
causes OutOfMemory exceptions.
