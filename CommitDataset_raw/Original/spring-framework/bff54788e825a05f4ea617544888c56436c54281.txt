Enable HTTP compression Reactor ClientHttpConnector

`ReactorClientHttpConnector` provides an adapter layer to `WebClient`
for using Reactor-Netty's `HttpClient`.
This commit enables HTTP compression support by default for this client
Connector.

Another constructor is still available for providing a custom
`HttpOptions` configuration.
