Refactor ExchangeResult

Clearly separate how the result of an exchange is represented before
the response body has been read (e.g. assertions on status and headers
only) vs later after the body is extracted to a representation
(assertions on the extracted body) or is decoded to Flux<T> (e.g. for
use with a StepVerifier).
