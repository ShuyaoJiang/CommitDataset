DeferredResult/ResponseBodyEmitter adapter mechanism

The DeferredResult~ and the ResponseBodyEmitterReturnValueHandler now
each expose an adapter mechanism for plugging in other async return
value types. As a result the ListenableFutureReturnValueHandler and
CompletionStageReturnValueHandler are no longer needed and are now
deprecated.
