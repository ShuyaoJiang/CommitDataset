Refine BeanPostProcessorChecker condition

Previously, adding `@EnableAsync` on a blank application would lead to an
info message stating that `ProxyAsyncConfiguration` is not eligible for
getting processed by all BeanPostProcessors. Concretely, this is ok as
such internal configuration is not meant to be a target of such post
processing.

Revisit the condition for non infrastructure bean only. Add the
infrastructure role to a set of internal configuration, including the
`ProxyAsyncConfiguration`.
