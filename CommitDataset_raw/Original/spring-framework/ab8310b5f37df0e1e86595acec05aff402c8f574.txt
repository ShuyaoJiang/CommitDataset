Fix HeadersAdapters implementations

This commit harmonizes the `HeadersAdapter` implementations across all
supported servers with regards to the `get(Object key)` contract; some
server implementations are not sticking to a `Map`-like contract and
return empty `List` instead of `null` when a header is not present.

This also fixes the `size()` implementations to reflect the number of
header keys, as some implementations consider multiple values for the
same header as different entries.
