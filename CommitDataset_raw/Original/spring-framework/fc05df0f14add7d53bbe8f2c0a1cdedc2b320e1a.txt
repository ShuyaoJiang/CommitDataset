Expose path matching settings in MVC Java config

Prior to this commit, one had to provide her own
RequestMappingHandlerMapping instance (i.e extend
WebMvcConfigurationSupport and override the requestMappingHandlerMapping
method) in order to customize path matching properties on that bean.

Since SPR-10163, XML config users can do that using the
<mvc:path-matching/> XML tag. This commit adds the same feature to MVC
Java config with a PathMatchConfigurer.

Issue: SPR-11486
