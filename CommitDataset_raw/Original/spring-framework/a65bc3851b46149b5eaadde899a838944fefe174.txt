Introduced local support for Hibernate 3.6 and 4.x exception translation to HibernateJpaDialect

Since Hibernate 3.6 and 4.x differ in exception handling now, this change makes HibernateJpaDialect independent from orm.hibernate3 now and avoids introducing a conditional dependency on orm.hibernate4.

Issue: SPR-10815
