Move toEntity(List) from WebClient.ResponseSpec to ClientResponse

This commit moves `toEntity(Class<T>)` and `toEntityList(Class<T>)`
from WebClient.ResponseSpec to ClientResponse. The main reason for doing
so is that the newly introduced `onStatus` method (see
2f9bd6e075facbf13edd629a98da88115c130b98) does not apply to these two
methods, and the result would be confusing. Also, `ClientResponse` and
`ResponseEntity` represent the same data: status code, headers, and a
body.
