Response headers always in sync with native response

ServerHttpResponse implementations now immediately propagate
HttpHeaders changes as they so there is no need to call applyHeaders().

The writeHeaders from ServerHttpResponse is also removed. RxNetty and
Reactor Net both support implicitly completing if the handler
completes without explicitly writing the headers or the response body.
