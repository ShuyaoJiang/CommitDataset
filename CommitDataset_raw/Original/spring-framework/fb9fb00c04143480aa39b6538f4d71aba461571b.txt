Update GenericWAC to implement ConfigurableWAC

GenericWebApplicationContext now implements
ConfigurableWebApplicationContext in order to be compatible with
Framework/DispatcherServlet and ContextLoader/Listener, especially with
regard to changes in SPR-7672 that allow for programmatic use of these
types within Servlet 3.0+ environments.  For the first time, it's now
reasonable to imagine injecting a GWAC into DispatcherServlet; the most
robust way to accommodate this possibility is for GWAC to implement
CWAC.

The implementation is in name only, allowing for interchangable use of
GWAC anywhere, for example, an XWAC could otherwise go.  Methods such
as setConfigLocation will throw UnsupportedOperationException if the
configLocation value actually contains text.  Other methods are
implemented as no-ops or to throw UOE as appropriate.

Issue: SPR-7672
