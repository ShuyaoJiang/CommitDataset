Declare ResourceUrlProvider in MVC namespace

This change adds a ResourceUrlProvider bean to the
ResourceBeanDefinitionParser to match the same in the Java config.
For consistency the name of the bean in the Java config is renamed.

Also a ResourceUrlProviderExposingInterceptor is declares as a global
MappedInterceptor.
