Only require an exception CacheResolver if necessary

Previously, a cache infrastructure with only a CacheResolver would have
worked fine until the JSR-107 API is added to the classpath. When this is
the case, the JCache support kicks in and an exception cache resolver is
all of the sudden required.

The CacheResolver _is_ different as the default implementation does look
different attributes so if a custom CacheResolver is set, it is not
possible to "reuse" it as a fallback exception CacheResolver.

Now, an exception CacheResolver is only required if a JSR-107 annotation
with an "exceptionCacheName" attribute is processed (i.e. the exception
CacheResolver is lazily instantiated if necessary).

The use case of having a CachingConfigurerSupport with only a
CacheResolver was still broken though since the JCache support only looks
for a JCacheConfigurer bean (per the generic type set on
AbstractCachingConfiguration). This has been fixed as well.
