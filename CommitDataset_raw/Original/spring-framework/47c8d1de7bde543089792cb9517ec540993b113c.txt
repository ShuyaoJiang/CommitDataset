Avoid calling other bean methods in web config

This commit changes the main configuration classes for Spring MVC and
Spring WebFlux to not call other bean methods when setting up the web
infrastructure. This allows configuration classes extending
`DelegatingWebFluxConfiguration` and `DelegatingWebMvcConfiguration`
to opt-in the lite-mode, as introduced in gh-22461.
