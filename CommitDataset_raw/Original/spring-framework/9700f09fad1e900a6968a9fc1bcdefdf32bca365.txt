Polish async feature for ServerHttpRequest/Response

ServerHttpAsyncResponseControl wraps a ServetHttpRequest and -Response
pair and allows putting the processing of the request in async mode
so that the response remains open until explicitly closed, either from
the current or from another thread.

ServletServerHttpAsyncResponseControl provides a Serlvet-based
implementation.
