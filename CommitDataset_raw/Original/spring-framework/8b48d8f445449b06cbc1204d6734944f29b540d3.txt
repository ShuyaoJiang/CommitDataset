Publish events about broker's availability

Components that are using a StompBrokerRelayMessageHandler may want
to know whether or not the broker's unavailable. If they're sending
messages to the relay via an asynchronous channel there's currently
no way for them to find this out.

This commit enhances StompBrokerRelayMessageHandler to publish
application events when the broker's availability changes:
BrokerBecameAvailableEvent and BrokerBecameUnavailableEvent.
Irrespective of the number of relay sessions only a single event is
published for each change in the broker's availability.
