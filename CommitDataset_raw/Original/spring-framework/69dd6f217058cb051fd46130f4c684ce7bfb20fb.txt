Remove EBR dependencies where possible

Only a select few EBR dependencies now remain, because these
dependencies cannot be found elsewhere e.g. atinject-tck, or in the case
of Hibernate 3.3.1.GA, to avoid Gradle classpath confusion with
Hibernate 4.0.x (because they have different artifactIds).

Future efforts will be made to fully eliminate these dependencies in
order to ensure we're decoupled completely from EBR.

Important note: these remaining EBR dependencies do not constitute a
problem when publishing artifacts into Maven Central via
oss.sonatype.org, because they are each 'optional' dependencies. It
appears that OSO's restriction around transitive dependencies being
'self-contained' within Maven Central only applies to mandatory
dependencies (which is a good thing for cases just such as this).

Add explicit /ebr-maven-external entry to repositories, as EBR
dependencies are not available via /libs-release.
