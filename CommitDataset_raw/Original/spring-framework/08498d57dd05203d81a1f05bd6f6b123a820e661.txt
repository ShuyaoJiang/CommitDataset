Fix line endings in new JacksonObjectMapper classes

Commit aa415d7c0c9f8435a3dcc29a8624b21c94a47dac introduced
JacksonObjectMapperFactoryBean and associated tests, but with Windows
(CRLF) line endings instead of the conventional Unix (LF) line endings.

This commit converts these files to LF endings using the handy
`dos2unix` utility.
