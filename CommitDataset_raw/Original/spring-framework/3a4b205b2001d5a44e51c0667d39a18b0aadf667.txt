Use Rouge syntax highlighting in PDF version of Reference Manual

This commit uses a tip provided by @mojavelinux to set the syntax
highlighter to Rouge for the PDF version of the User Guide.

Once Asciidoctor 1.5.7 has been released we will likely switch to Rouge
for the HTML version of the Reference Manual as well.
