Merge rather than add URI vars to data binding values

As of Spring 3.1 URI variables can be used for data binding purposes in
addition to request parameters (including query string and form params)

In some cases URI variables and request params can overlap (e.g. form
contains a child entity with an entityId as hidden form input while the
URI contains the entityId of the parent entity) and that can lead to
surprises if the application already exists.

This change ensures that request parameters are used first and URI
vars are added only if they don't overlap. Ideally however an
application should not use the same uri variable name as the name of
a request parameter where they don't refer to the same value.

Issue: SPR-9349
