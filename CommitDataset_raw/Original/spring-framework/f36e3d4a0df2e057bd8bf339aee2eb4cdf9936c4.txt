Support for mutating ServerWebExchange in WebTestClient

This commit adds a common base class for server-less setup with the
option to configure a transformation function on the
ServerWebExchange for every request.

The transformation is applied through a WebFilter. As a result the
RouterFunction setup is now invoked behind a DispatcherHandler with
a HandlerMapping + HandlerAdapter.
