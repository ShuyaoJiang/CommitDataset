Support conditional processing in TestContext event annotations

This commit introduces support for SpEL expressions for conditional
event processing in annotations such as @BeforeTestClass,
@BeforeTestMethod, etc.

This commit also introduces a new getTestContext() method in
TestContextEvent in order to improve the readability of such SpEL
expressions.
