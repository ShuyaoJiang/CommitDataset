Unwrap TypeVariables before calling .equals()

Update ResolvableType to unwrap Serialization wrapped TypeVariables
before calling the equals method.

This protects against the recent change in OpenJDK 8 (build 124)
which changed the TypeVariableImpl equals method such that it only
matches against other TypeVariableImpl instances.

Issue: SPR-11342
