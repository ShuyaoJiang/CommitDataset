Defensive initialization of AsyncXMLInputFactory

Aalto's InputFactoryImpl already disables loading of external entities
by default (property "javax.xml.stream.isSupportingExternalEntities").
This commit goes further by applying the same defensive measures as we
do elsewhere for XMLInputFactory, which disables DTD completely.
Arguably there is no good reason to enable that by default in WebFlux.
