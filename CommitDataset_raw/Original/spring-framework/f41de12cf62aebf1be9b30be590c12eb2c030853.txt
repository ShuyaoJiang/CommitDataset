Ensure synthesized nested annotation arrays retain correct type

Prior to this commit, when a nested array of annotations was
synthesized while adapting values within an AnnotationAttributes map,
the array was improperly replaced with an array of type Annotation[]
instead of an array of the concrete annotation type, which can lead to
unexpected run-time exceptions.

This commit fixes this bug by replacing annotations in the existing
array with synthesized versions of those annotations, thereby retaining
the original array's component type.
