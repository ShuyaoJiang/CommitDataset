Fix error when writing empty String to DataBuffer

Prior to this commit, `DataBuffer.write` would throw an
`IllegalStateException` when called with an empty `String`, since the
`CharsetEncoder` would be flushed on an incorrent state.

This commit skips entirely the encoding phase for empty `String`.

Fixes #22262
