Consolidate matrix vars parsing in HttpRequestPathHelper

Restore matrix variable parsing code not resorting to the use of
WebUtils which brings Servlet API dependencies with it.

Instead the parsing logic is now exposed through HttpRequestPathHelper
which already contained the decoding logic and also the knowledge of
whether to decode the parsed variables or not.
