Add generics support for WebResponseExtractors

This commit adds generics support for WebResponseExtractors.
Types should be described using a ResolvableType, which can be
created with static methods like:

    // for the type Event<Registration>
    ResolvableType.forClassWithGenerics(Event.class, Registration.class)

Fixes #89
