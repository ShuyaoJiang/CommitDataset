SPR-6296 Spring:url tag should not use application/x-www-form-urlencoded encoding

Work around for application/x-www-form-urlencoded encoding.  Replaces '+' from java.net.URLDecoder with charset specific encoded space value ('%20' for most charsets).

The custom urlEncode method should be replaced with calls to a true URL encoder once available.
