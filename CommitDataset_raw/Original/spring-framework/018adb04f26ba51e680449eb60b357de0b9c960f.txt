Add converter support for Stream

Add StreamConverter to provide full support for converting
java.util.stream.Stream instances to and from collections or arrays.

Also attempt to convert the element type if necessary.

StreamConverter is registered by default in the DefaultConversionService
as long as Java8 is available.
