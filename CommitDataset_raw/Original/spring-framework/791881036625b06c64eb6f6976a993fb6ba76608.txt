SPR-8750 Update MockHttpServletRequest/Response handling of contentType.

The Content-Type header and the contentType field in HttpServletRequest/Response
are now always in sync. When a header is added the contentType field is updated
as well and vice versa. 

Similarly when the Content-Type header or the contentType field includes a charset 
field, the character encoding is updated and vice versa.
