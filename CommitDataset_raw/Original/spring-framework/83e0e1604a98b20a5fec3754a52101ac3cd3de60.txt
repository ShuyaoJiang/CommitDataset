Refine encoding/decoding exception handling

Starting with removing a package cycle on the use of
ResponseStatusException in the codec package, this commit generally
refines codec exception handling.

The new [Encoding|Decoding]Exception mirror the existing
HttpMessageNot[Readable|Writable]Exception and are used similarly
especially to differentiate betwen 400 and 500 errors when parsing
server request body content.

The commit also aligns some of the exception handling of JSON and XML
on the WebFlux side with that on the Spring MVC side.

Issue: SPR-15516
