Preserve ordering of inlined props in @TestPropertySource

The initial implementation for adding inlined properties configured via
@TestPropertySource to the context's environment did not preserve the
order in which the properties were physically declared. This makes
@TestPropertySource a poor testing facility for mimicking the
production environment's configuration if the property source mechanism
used in production preserves ordering of property names -- which is the
case for YAML-based property sources used in Spring Boot, Spring Yarn,
etc.

This commit addresses this issue by ensuring that the ordering of
inlined properties declared via @TestPropertySource is preserved.
Specifically, the original functionality has been refactored. extracted
from AbstractContextLoader, and moved to TestPropertySourceUtils where
it may later be made public for general purpose use in other frameworks.
