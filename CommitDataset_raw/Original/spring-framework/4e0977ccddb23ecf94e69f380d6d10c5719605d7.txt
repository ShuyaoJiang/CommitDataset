Expand repackaged asm/cglib jars into spring-core

Prior to this change, the repackaged spring-asm and spring-cglib jars
were being included wholesale in the spring-core jar, whereas the
intention was to include the unzipped classfiles.

This change ensures that spring-asm and spring-cglib jars are unzipped
on the fly when creating the spring-core jar.

Issue: SPR-9669
