Rework implementation of PathPattern.extractPathWithinPattern

This commit changes the implementation of the PathPattern
extractPathWithinPattern method that used an old AntPathMatcher
derivative to a new version that integrates more closely with
PathContainer.

It also introduces consistency in a couple of areas. The javadoc
is updated to specify this but basically:
- the response from the extra method will have all leading
  and trailing separators removed.
- the response will have multiple adjacent separators within the
  reponse reduced to just one.  (For example response would be
  aaa/bb/cc and not aaa///bbb//cc)
If your response would start or finish with multiple separators, they
are all removed.

Issue: SPR-16120
