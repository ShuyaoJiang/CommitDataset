Add simple URL mapping and handling

This commit adds support for simple URL handler mapping (exact path
match) and an adapter for the HttpHandler interface to be used to
handle the request.

The SimpleUrlHandlerMappingIntegrationTests then maps the URLs
"/foo" and "/bar" to two different handlers.
