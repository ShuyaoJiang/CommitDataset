Make MBeanServer integration tests more robust

This commit overhauls several of the tests that interact with an
MBeanServer with the goal of increasing the reliability of these tests.

 - MBeanClientInterceptorTests now uses JUnit "assumptions" instead of
   preemptively returning from test methods, thus allowing such methods
   to be properly marked as "ignored" instead of "passed".

 - MBeanClientInterceptorTests now uses JUnit's support for expected
   exceptions where appropriate.

 - MBeanClientInterceptorTests and RemoteMBeanClientInterceptorTests now
   use Spring's SocketUtils to find an available TCP port when starting
   an MBeanServer instead of aborting the tests when the default JMX
   port is not available.
