Fix regression in @PropertySource placeholder resolution

Changes in commit 41ade68b50b39485b3cf02b9c6fb8eb74962146b introduced
a regression causing all but the first location in the
@PropertySource#value array to be ignored during ${...} placeholder
resolution. This change ensures that all locations are processed and
replaced as expected.

Issue: SPR-9133, SPR-9127
