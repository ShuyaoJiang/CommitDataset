Polish (major) MVC async processing interceptors

New afterTimeout and afterCompletion callbacks

afterTimeout can provide a concurrent result to be used instead of the
one that could not be set or returned on time

Interceptor exceptions cause async processing to resume treating the
exception as the concurrent result

Adapter classes for convenient implementation of the interfaces

Issue: SPR-9914
