Remove unnecessary mentions of aspectjrt/aspectjweaver

aspectjrt is a subset of aspectjweaver. Eliminate mentions of aspectjrt
where aspectjweaver is already necessary (e.g. LTW), and do not mention
aspectjweaver where only aspectrt is required (e.g. @Aspect proxying)

Also bump required version of aspect* libs from 1.5 to 1.6.8, reflecting
OSGi and pom metadata.
