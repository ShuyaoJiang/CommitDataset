Require JUnit 4.9 or higher in the TCF

Prior to this commit, the Spring TestContext Framework (TCF) was
compatible with JUnit 4.5 or higher.

This commit effectively raises the minimum version of JUnit that is
officially supported by the TCF to JUnit 4.9, thereby aligning with
similar upgrades made in the Spring Framework 4.0 release (i.e.,
upgrading minimum requirements on third-party libraries to versions
released mid 2010 or later).
