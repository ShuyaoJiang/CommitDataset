Allow customization of SpEL method resolution

This change introduces a protected ReflectiveMethodResolver#getMethods,
allowing subclasses to specify additional static methods not
declared directly on the type being evaluated. These methods then become
candidates for filtering by any registered MethodFilters and ultimately
become available within for use within SpEL expressions.
