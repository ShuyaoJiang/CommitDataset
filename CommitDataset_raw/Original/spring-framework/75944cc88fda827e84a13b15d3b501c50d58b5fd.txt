Support nested double quotes in SpEL expressions

The Spring Expression Language currently supports nested single quotes
within expressions but not nested double quotes.

The SpEL tokenizer has been modified to support nested double quotes in
the same way it supports single quotes. A sequence of two double quotes
will now be replaced by one when evaluated.

Extra error handling has also been added to report when invalid escaping
is encountered, since SpEL does not support escaping with backslash.

Issue: SPR-9620
