Prevent non public bean to be exposed to JMX

Previously, a package private `@ManagedResource` annotated bean was
registered to the JMX domain even if any attempt to invoke an operation
on it will fail since it has to be public.

This commit validates that any `@ManagedResource` annotated bean is
public and throws an InvalidMetadataException otherwise. Note that the
actual bean type does not have to be public as long as the class
annotated with `@ManagedResource` in the hierarchy is pubic and no extra
operations or attributes are defined on the child.

Issue: SPR-14042
