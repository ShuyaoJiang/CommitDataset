Extend AnnotationMetadata and MethodMetadata

Update AnnotationMetadata and MethodMetadata to extend from a new
AnnotatedTypeMetadata base interface containing the methods that are
common to both. Also introduce new getAllAnnotationAttributes methods
providing MultiValueMap access to both annotation and meta-annotation
attributes.

Existing classreading and standard implementations have been
refactored to support the new interface.
