Remove <emphasis> to work around DocBook bug

It was determined (through painful trial and error) that after the
upgrade to DocBook 5 and the gradle-docbook-reference plugin, that
<emphasis> elements embedded within <programlisting> elements causes
NullPointerExceptions during processing.

This change eliminates these <emphasis> elements to work around the
problem. This means a slight degradation in presentation for the
affected areas of the reference documentation. After some research,
it is not clear what other workarounds may be possible that leave
the text actually emphasized.
