Make spring-orm dependency on spring-web optional

Historically spring-orm has had an optional dependency on spring-web,
primarily in support of OpenSessionInView functionality. This optional
dependency was inadvertently made required when porting the build to
Gradle. This commit simply reintroduces the optional setting.

Issue: SPR-9632
