Support target type in JsonPath assertions

This change adds support for a target type in JsonPath assertions in
Spring MVC Test.

The existing assertValue(String expression, Object expectedValue)
transparently falls back on using an alternative JsonPath API that
allows specifying the target type to coerce to.

There is also a new overloaded method
assertValue(String expression, Matcher<T> matcher, Class<T> targetType)
for use with Hamcrest matchers where the target type can be specified.

Issue: SPR-14498
