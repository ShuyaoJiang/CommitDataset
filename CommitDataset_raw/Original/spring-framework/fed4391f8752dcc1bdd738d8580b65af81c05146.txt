Fix issue in UriTemplate parsing

The recent commit 971f04 replaced the use of a NAMES_PATTERN regex in
favor of direct parsing in order to deal with nested curly braces.

The change also incorrectly replicated this logic which removes a
trailing slash after Pattern quoting (and not before):

https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/cca037a74df9b87f99858154b47696a9eccf69c8/spring-web/src/main/java/org/springframework/web/util/UriTemplate.java#L207-L210

After some more investigation there doesn't appear to be any scenario
where the quoted pattern would end with a trailing slash. It should
always end with \E (end of quote) or a ")" (end of group). Nor are
there any failing tests so this commit removes the logic altogether.

Issue: SPR-13705
