Allow MBeans to be excluded additively

Previously, one could only set the list of bean names to exclude from
auto-detection and there was no way to add additional bean names.

MBeanExporter now exposes a addExcludedBean method that can be invoked
during the initialization phase to add bean names to ignore.
