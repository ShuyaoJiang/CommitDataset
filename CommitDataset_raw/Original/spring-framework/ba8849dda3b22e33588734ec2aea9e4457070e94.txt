Avoid MimeType garbage creation

Prior to this commit, calls to `MimeType` and `MediaType` would create a
significant amount of garbage:

* during startup time, in the static sections of `MimeType` and
`MediaType` when creating well-known types
* at runtime, when parsing media types for content negotiation or
writing known media types as strings in HTTP response headers

This commit does the following:

* Avoid parsing the well-known types and use regular constructors
instead
* Cache types in a simple LRU cache once they've been parsed, since an
application is likely to deal with a limited set of types
* Avoid using `java.util.stream.Stream` in hot code paths

Benchmarks show that a complete revision of the `MimeTypeUtils` parser
is not required, since the LRU cache is enough there.

Closes gh-22340
