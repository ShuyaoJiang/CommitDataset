Peek into the content for @RequestBody(required=false)

For @RequestBody(required=false), it is not sufficient to check if the
InputStream is null. This change reads the first byte of the request
InputStream to determine if the request body is empty or not.

If the InputStream implementation supports mark(int) and reset(), then
we use those. Otherwise we use PushbackInputStream to read and unread
the first byte.

All of this is done only if the required flag of @RequestBody is set
to "false" (default is "true").
