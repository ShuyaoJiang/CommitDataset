Ignore failing tests on Windows

Attempt to access and modify the system environment works on OS X /
Linux but not under Windows. Does not represent any real failure for
production code - the need to modify the system environment is a
testing concern only, and one we can probably live without, considering
the losing battle necessary to make such a hack cross-platform.
