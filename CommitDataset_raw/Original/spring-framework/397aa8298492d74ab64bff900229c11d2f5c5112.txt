Fix expression cache

Prior to this commit, only the java.lang.reflect.Method was used to
identify an annotated method. As a result, if different annotations
were placed on different methods (method overriding, interface
implementation) only the first one (cached) was used.

LazyParamAwareEvaluationContext was affected by the exact
same problem and has been also fixed.
