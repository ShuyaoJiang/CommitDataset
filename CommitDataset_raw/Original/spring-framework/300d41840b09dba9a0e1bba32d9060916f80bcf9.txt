Fix JDK7 method order-dependent issues in SRCCT

SpringRunnerContextCacheTests suffers from JDK7-related non-determinism
in values returned from Class#getDeclaredMethods(), which in turn
affects JUnit and its execution of @Test methods.

This commit addresses this issue by introducing an
OrderedMethodsSpringJUnit4ClassRunner that sorts the test methods
alphabetically, which is actually required for
SpringRunnerContextCacheTests to work properly.
