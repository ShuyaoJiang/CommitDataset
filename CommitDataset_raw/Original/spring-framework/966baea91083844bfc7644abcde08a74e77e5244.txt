Fix HtmlUnitRequestBuilder merge

Previously invoking HtmlUnitRequestBuilder merge caused the pathInfo of
the parent to be corrupted. This could additional invocations with the
same parent.

This fix ensures that the parent is no longer directly used. Instead,
we create a copy of the parent by merging the parent that was passed in
with the copy.

Fixes SPR-14584
