Use List<T> instead of Supplier<Stream<T>>

This commit changes all methods that return `Supplier<Stream<T>` to
return `List<T>` instead. This includes the HandlerStrategies, but also
BodyInserter.Context, BodyExtractor.Context, and ServerResponse.Context.

The reason for this change is that most of the strategies have some sort
of order, where more specific message readers - for instance - come
before generic ones. Such an ordering can only be enforced through a
List.
