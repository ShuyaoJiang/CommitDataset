Do not process undefined conditional HTTP requests

Prior to this change, the HttpEntityMethodProcessor would try to process
conditional requests that are undefined by the spec, such as:

* an HTTP GET request with "If-None-Match:*"
* a request with both "If-None-Match" and "If-Match"
* a request with both "If-None-Match" and "If-Unmodified-Since"

This commit skips the processing of those requests as conditional
requests and continues with normal request handling.

Issue: SPR-13626
