Sort candidate @AspectJ methods deterministically

Update the ReflectiveAspectJAdvisorFactory class to sort candidate
AOP methods based on their annotation first and method name second.

Prior to this the order of aspects created from annotated methods
could differ depending on the underling JVM, as first noticed under
JDK7 in SPR-9729.

 - ConvertingComparator and InstanceComparator have been introduced in
   support of this change, per SPR-9730.

 - A shared static INSTANCE field has been added to ComparableComparator
   to avoid unnecessary instantiation costs within ConvertingComparator
   as well as to prevent generics warnings during certain caller
   scenarios.

Issue: SPR-9729, SPR-9730
