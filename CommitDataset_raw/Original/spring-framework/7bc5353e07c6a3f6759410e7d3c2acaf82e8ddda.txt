Do not sort the mvc:resources location attribute

Update ResourcesBeanDefinitionParser to use ensure that location
attribute values remain in the order that they are specified. The
order was inadvertently changed in commit 3838d159f3 due to the use
of StringUtils.commaDelimitedListToSet which sorts items.

Issue: SPR-10355
