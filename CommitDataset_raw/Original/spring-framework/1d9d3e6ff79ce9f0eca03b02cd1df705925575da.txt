Fix false negative test failure in ResourceTests

Prior to changes in commit 57851de88e84006afc104c4f22eb2fbaf2e0d3d1,
AbstractResource#getFilename threw IllegalStateException unless
overridden by a subclass. Following that change, this method now throws
null instead, but ResourceTests#testAbstractResourceExceptions had not
been updated to reflect, resulting in a false negative failure. This has
now been fixed.
