Restrict HTTP methods on Servlet HiddenHttpMethodFilter

This commit restricts the allowed HTTP methods on HiddenHttpMethodFilter
(Servlet variant) to the following: PUT, DELETE, PATCH.

This filter is meant to be used to simulate those methods from HTML
forms sent by browsers, so no other methods are allowed.

Issue: SPR-16836
