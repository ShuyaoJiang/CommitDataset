MockMvc HtmlUnit support shares CookieManager

Previously MockMvc builders failed to share the WebConnection used for
managing cookies in the MockMvcWebConnection. This meant that the various
CookieManagers would have different states.

This commit ensures that the WebConnection is set on the
MockMvcWebConnection.

Fixes SPR-14066
