Avoid NPE in ObjectToObjectConverter

Bypass ObjectToObject conversion when source and object types are
identical and protect against a null source object.

Prior to this commit the TypeDescriptor was used to determine if
conversion was necessary.  This caused issues when comparing a
descriptor with annotations to one without.  The updated code
now compares using TypeDescriptor.getType().

The ObjectToObject converter will now no longer attempt to convert
null source objects.

Issue: SPR-9933
