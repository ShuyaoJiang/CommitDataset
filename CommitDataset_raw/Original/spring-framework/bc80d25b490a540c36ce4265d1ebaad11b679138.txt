Restore compile dependencies in generated POMs

Ensure that merge projects do not downgrade the compile time
dependencies of the projects that they are merged into.

This commit restores the scope of the following dependencies which
were inadvertently changed between Spring 3.2.0 and 3.2.1:

    spring-orm
    -> spring-tx
    -> spring-jdbc

    spring-webmvc
    -> spring-context
    -> spring-web

    spring-test
    -> spring-webmvc

Issue: SPR-10218
