Support non thread-safe ScriptEngine in ScriptTemplateView

This commit adds a new sharedEngine property to ScriptTemplateConfigurer
and ScriptTemplateView in order to support non thread-safe ScriptEngine
implementations like Nashorn.

When this flag is set to false, the engine is retrieved from a
ThreadLocal<ScriptEngine> field instead of a ScriptEngine one.

Also as part of this commit, all the initialization logic has been moved from
ScriptTemplateConfigurer to ScriptTemplateView since the script engine can
now be lazily initialized multiple time in the view when sharedEngine is
set to false.
