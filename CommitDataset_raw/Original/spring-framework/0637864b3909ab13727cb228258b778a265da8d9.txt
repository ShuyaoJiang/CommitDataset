Ensure AnnotationUtils is compatible with Java 6

The previous commit introduced a dependency on
Class.getDeclaredAnnotation() which is a Java 8 API.

This commit refactors AnnotationUtils.findAnnotation(Class, Class, Set)
to use Class.getAnnotation() in conjunction with
isAnnotationDeclaredLocally() in order to achieve the same desired
behavior.

Issue: SPR-11475
