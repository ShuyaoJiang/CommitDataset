Update AbstractView with method to set content type

Before this change View implementations set the response content type
to the fixed value they were configured with.

This change makes it possible to configure a View implementation with
a more general media type, e.g. "application/*+xml", and then set the
response type to the more specific requested media type, e.g.
"application/vnd.example-v1+xml".

Issue: SPR-9807.
