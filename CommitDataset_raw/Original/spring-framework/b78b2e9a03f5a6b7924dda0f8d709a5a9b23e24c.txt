Fix priority semantic

Commit 5fe8f52 introduced a support for @Priority as an alternative to
@Primary but it broke the semantic of the priority value. This commit
fixes this inconsistency.

As for @Order, the lowest value means the highest priority so if
several beans are candidates for injection, the one having the lowest
value will be used.

Issue: SPR-10548
