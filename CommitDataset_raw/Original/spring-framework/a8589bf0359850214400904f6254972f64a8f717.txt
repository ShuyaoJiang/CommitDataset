Replace dependency to aspectjrt with aspectjweaver

Replace the gradle dependency on aspectjrt with aspectjweaver since
aspectjrt is a subset of aspectjweaver and the full jar is required
by Spring. SPR-8896 fixed the original code issue, this change
just relates to the generated maven pom.

Issue: SPR-10072
