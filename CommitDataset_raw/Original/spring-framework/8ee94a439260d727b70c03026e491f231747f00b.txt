Eclipse project deps come after third-party libs

Prior to this commit, the ordering of classpath entries in the
generated Eclipse .classpath files did not align with the intended
dependency management configured in the Gradle build. Specifically,
project dependencies often came before dependencies on third-party
libraries required for the given project, causing the project not to
compile in Eclipse.

This commit fixes this issue by introducing new functionality in the
ide.gradle script that moves all project dependencies to the end of the
generated classpath.

Issue: SPR-11836
