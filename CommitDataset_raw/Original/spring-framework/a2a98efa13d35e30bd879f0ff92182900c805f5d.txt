Remove references to 'bold' text in reference docs

<emphasis role="bold"> blocks do not render properly, probably due to
conflicting CSS used for syntax highlighting. For the moment, any
mentions of bold text (e.g. "see bold text in the snippet below") have
been removed to avoid confusion as reported in SPR-8520.  SPR-8526 has
been created to address the underlying issue of getting bold to work
even with syntax highlighting.

Issue: SPR-8520, SPR-8526
