Fix error responses handling in WebClient

This commit fixes a typo in the `DefaultWebClient` implementation.
Instead of forwarding resolved `WebClientException` instances as error
signals, the `bodyToMono(ParameterizedTypeReference)` variant would just
forward those exceptions as `onNext` signals.

Issue: SPR-15946
