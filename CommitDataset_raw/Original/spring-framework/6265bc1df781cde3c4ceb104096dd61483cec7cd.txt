Fall back on user in the Jetty UpgradeRequest

The Jetty ServletWebUpgradeRequest implements getUserPrincipal to
return the Principal from the HttpServletRequest on the upgrade.
This change ensures we can fall back on that.

However the JettyRequestUpgradeStrategy still passes the user from
HttpServletRequest from the upgrade, in order to work with Jetty
9.0.x and avoid running into this 9.1.x issue:
