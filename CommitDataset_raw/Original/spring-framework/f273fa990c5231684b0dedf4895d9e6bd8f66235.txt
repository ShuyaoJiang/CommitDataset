Use RepeatableContainers.none() in AnnotationUtils

Update `AnnotationUtils` so that `RepeatableContainers.none()` is used
when performing an exhaustive search for merged annotations. These
parameters were accidentally removed in commit 210b1789 and weren't
caught earlier because we were missing a test.

Closes gh-22702
