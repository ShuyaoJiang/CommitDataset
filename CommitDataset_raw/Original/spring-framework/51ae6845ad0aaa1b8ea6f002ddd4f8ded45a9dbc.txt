Fix JibxMarshallerTests failing on Windows

Before this change JibxMarshallerTests would fail on Windows with an
error message explaining that JiBX compiler generated classes are not
found on the classpath for binding with name 'binding'. Tests would
execute well on Linux and OS X.

Actual root cause of this bug is found to be in JiBX 1.1.5 release that
is used to build Spring. The binding name can be explicitly specified in
JiBX binding file. If omitted, when generating classes the JiBX compiler
as fall-back mechanism tries to derive the binding name from the binding
file name. That logic had a bug which gets manifested when configured
binding file path has mixed Windows and *nix style file separators, as
in case of JibxMarshallerTests being executed on a Windows platform.

This commit resolves this issue by upgrading Spring's build from JiBX
1.1.5 to 1.2.3, as the bug mentioned was fixed in JiBX 1.2. See JIBX-441
for more details.

Issue: SPR-8360
