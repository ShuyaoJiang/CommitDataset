Return 5xx HTTP status for invalid target types with Jackson

InvalidDefinitionException has been introduced in Jackson 2.9 to be
able to differentiate invalid data sent from the client (should still
generate a 4xx HTTP status code) from server side errors like beans with
no default constructor (should generate a 5xx HTTP status code).

Issue: SPR-14925
