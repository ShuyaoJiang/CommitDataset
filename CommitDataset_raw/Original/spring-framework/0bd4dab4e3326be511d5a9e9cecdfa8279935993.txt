Filter @Configuration classes out of LTW test

Moving @EnableMBeanExport and its MBeanExportConfiguration
@Configuration class into context.annotation caused a side effect with
ComponentScanningWithLTWTests, which component scans context.annotation
in order to test LTW behavior. Picking up MBeanExportConfiguration
without proper MBean configuration resulted in a NullPointerException
during test execution.

This commit simply filters out all @Configuration classes from the LTW
test's component-scanning directive.
