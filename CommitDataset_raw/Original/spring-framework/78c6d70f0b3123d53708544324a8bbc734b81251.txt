Refute claims made in SPR-9051

It was claimed that when a {@code @ContextConfiguration} test class
references a config class missing an {@code @Configuration} annotation,
@Bean dependencies are wired successfully but the bean lifecycle is not
applied (no init methods are invoked, for example).

AnnotatedConfigClassesWithoutAtConfigurationTests refutes this claim by
demonstrating that @Bean methods in non-@Configuration classes are
properly handled as "annotated factory bean methods" and that lifecycle
callbacks in fact apply to such factory beans.
