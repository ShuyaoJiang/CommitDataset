Support ScriptEngine#eval(String, Bindings) in ScriptTemplateView

Supporting ScriptEngine#eval(String, Bindings) when no render function
is specified allows to support use cases where script templates are
simply evaluating a script expression with an even more simplified
configuration.

This improvement also makes it possible to use script engines that
do not implement Invocable.
