Update Netty4ClientHttpRequestFactory buffer size

Before this change, the maxRequestSize property was used (incorrectly)
to limit both the size of the request and response. The change:

- removes maxRequestSize and therefore no longer places limits on the
size of the request thus matching to AbstractBufferingClientHttpRequest
which is the base class for other buffering client implementations.

- adds maxResponseSize property required to create Netty's
HttpObjectAggregator for aggregating responses.
