Ignore non-prop 'set' methods in ExtendedBeanInfo

Previously, ExtendedBeanInfo would attempt to process methods named
exactly 'set'.  JavaBeans properties must have at least one character
following the 'set' prefix in order to qualify, and this is now
respected by EBI.

Thanks to Rob Winch for the patch fixing this problem.

Issue: SPR-8175
