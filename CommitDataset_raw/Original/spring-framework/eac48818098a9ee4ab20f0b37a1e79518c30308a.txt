Make RequestMappingHandlerMapping xml config easier

Prior to this commit, it was necessary to override
the HandlerMapping definition to change properties
like useSuffixPatternMatch, useSuffixPatternMatch...
Also, one couldn't set custom pathmatcher/pathhelper
on RequestMappingHandlerMapping via XML configuration.

This commits adds a new "mvc:annotation-driven"
subelement called "mvc:path-matching" for the tag
that allows to configure such properties:
* suffix-pattern
* trailing-slash
* registered-suffixes-only
* path-matcher
* path-helper

Note: this is a new take on this issue, since
96b418cc has been reverted by e2b99c3.

Issue: SPR-10163
