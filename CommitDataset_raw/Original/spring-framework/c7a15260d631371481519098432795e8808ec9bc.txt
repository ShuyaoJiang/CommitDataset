Various DataBuffer improvements

- DataBuffer now exposes its read and write position, as well as its
capacity and writable byte count.
- Added DataBuffer.asByteBuffer(int, int)
- DataBufferUtils.read now reads directly into a DataBuffer, rather than
copying a ByteBuffer into a DataBuffer
- TomcatHttpHandler now reads directly into a DataBuffer
