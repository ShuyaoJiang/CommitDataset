Support for multiple events per method

In addition to specifying the event type to listen to via a method
parameter, any @EventListener annotated method can now alternatively
define the event type(s) to listen to via the "classes" attributes (that
is aliased to "value").

Something like

@EventListener({FooEvent.class, BarEvent.class})
public void handleFooBar() { .... }
