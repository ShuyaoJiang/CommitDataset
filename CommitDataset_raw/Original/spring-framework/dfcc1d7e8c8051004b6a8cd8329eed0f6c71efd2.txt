Add default ViewResolver to MVC Java config

Since the MVC Java config always registers a ViewResolver (composite)
bean, at a very minimum we must add an InternalResourceViewResolver
consistent with default DispatcherServlet configuration and by
extension with the MVC namespace which falls back on DispatcherServlet
implicity if no <view-resolvers> element is present.
