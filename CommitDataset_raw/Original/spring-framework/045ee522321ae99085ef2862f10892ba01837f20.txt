Invoke target.toString() safely in ReflectionTestUtils

ReflectionTestUtils invokes toString() on target objects in order to
build exception and logging messages, and prior to this commit problems
could occur if the invocation of toString() threw an exception.

This commit addresses this issue by ensuring that all invocations of
toString() on target objects within ReflectionTestUtils are performed
safely within try-catch blocks.

Issue: SPR-14363
