Fix detection of the @SendTo annotation

Previously, the default reply destination could not be discovered if the
@JmsListener annotation was placed on a bean that is eligible for
proxying as the proxy method is used internally and does not reveal
an annotation placed on the implementation.

This commit makes sure to resolve the most specific method when
searching that annotation.
