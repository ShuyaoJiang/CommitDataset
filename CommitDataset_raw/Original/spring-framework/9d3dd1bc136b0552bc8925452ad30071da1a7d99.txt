Introduce SpringRunner 'alias' for SpringJUnit4ClassRunner

This commit introduces a SpringRunner extension of
SpringJUnit4ClassRunner that is intended to be used as an 'alias' for
SpringJUnit4ClassRunner, primarily in order to simplify configuration
of JUnit 4 based integration tests.

Developers can use this alias as follows:

    @RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
    public class MySpringIntegrationTests { ... }

Issue: SPR-13954
