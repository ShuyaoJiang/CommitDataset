Fix SpEL handling of function reference

These changes provide more robust handling of function
reference compilation in SpEL expressions. Prior to
this change the isCompilable check was not performing
enough visibility checks on the proposed target
function, causing bytecode to be generated that
would lead to an IllegalAccessError.
The changes also bring the argument handling for
function invocation completely inline with that used
for method invocation allowing some code to be deleted.

Many new tests are also included for function
reference compilation.

Issue: SPR-12359
