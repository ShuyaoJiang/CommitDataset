Missing path variable is now a 500 error

Before this change a missing path variable value resulted in a 400
error where in fact the error is due to a mismatch between the
declared @PathVariable and the URI template, i.e. a 500 error.

This change introduced a MissingPathVariableException as a sub-class
of ServletRequestBindingException (the exception previously thrown)
and results in a response status code of 500 by default.

Issue: SPR-13121
