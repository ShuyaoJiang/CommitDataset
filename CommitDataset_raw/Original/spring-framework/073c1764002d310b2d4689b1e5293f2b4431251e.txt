Fix test

The rework of 314b069 in a7fec6a has created a lazy proxy to make sure
that the need for an exception cache resolver come as late as possible.

Unfortunately, the test that was only failing on CI because of an early
lookup has not been updated accordingly. This is now the case.

Issue: SPR-12850
