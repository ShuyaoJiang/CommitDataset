Improve configuration changes in GuavaCacheManager

Prior to this commit, setting the parameters used to build the caches
was fragile in static mode as the caches were created right when the
setCacheNames setter was called.

This commit provides a better handling of such arguments and also
provide a way to restore the dynamic mode if necessary.

Issue: SPR-12120
