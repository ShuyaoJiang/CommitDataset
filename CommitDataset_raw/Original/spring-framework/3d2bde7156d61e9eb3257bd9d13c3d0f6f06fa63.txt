Add tests that use the new generate-name attribute

This commit updates the Spr8849Tests test suite to include XML
configuration that guarantees that a unique database name is always
automatically generated (via the new 'generate-name' attribute that was
introduced in SPR-8849) while reusing the same bean name (i.e.,
'dataSource').
