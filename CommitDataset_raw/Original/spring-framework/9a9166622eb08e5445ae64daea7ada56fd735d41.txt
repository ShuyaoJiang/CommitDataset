Fix ForwardedHeaderFilter getRequestURL()

Previously ForwardedHeaderFilter would return the same StringBuffer for every invocation. This
meant that users that modified the StringBuffer changed the state of the HttpServletRequest.

This commit ensures that a new StringBuffer is always returned for ForwardedHeaderFilter.
