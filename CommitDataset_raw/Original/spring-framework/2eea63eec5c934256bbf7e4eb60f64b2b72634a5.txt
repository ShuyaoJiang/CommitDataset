Introduce Framework/DispatcherServlet constructors

Constructors have been added to both FrameworkServlet and
DispatcherServlet to support instance-based programmatic registration
of Servlets within ServletContainerInitializer implementations in
Servlet 3.0+ environments, and more particularly when using Spring 3.1's
WebApplicationInitializer SPI.

This change also renames the method added to FrameworkServlet in
SPR-8185 from #initializeWebApplicationContext to #applyInitializers.
The reason being that a method named #initWebApplicationContext was
already present and the names overlapped confusingly.

Issue: SPR-7672, SPR-8185
