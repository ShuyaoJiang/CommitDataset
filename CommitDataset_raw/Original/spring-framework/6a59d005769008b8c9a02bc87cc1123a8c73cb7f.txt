Fix references and typos in Spring MVC Test Javadoc

This commit fixes numerous references to 'legacy' packages within the
Javadoc for the Spring MVC Test framework.

In addition, this commit improves examples in Javadoc, adds links to
related classes where appropriate, and removes unnecessary imports for
types that are only referenced within documentation.
