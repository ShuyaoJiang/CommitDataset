Avoid eager formatting in pre-condition checks

In general, the Spring Framework aims to construct error message
strings only if an actual error has occurred. This seems to be the
common pattern in the codebase and saves both CPU and memory. However,
there are some places where eager error message formatting occurs
unnecessarily.

This commit addresses this issue in the following classes:
AdviceModeImportSelector, AnnotationAttributes, and
ReadOnlySystemAttributesMap.

The change in ReadOnlySystemAttributesMap also avoids a potential
NullPointerException.

Issue: SPR-13007
