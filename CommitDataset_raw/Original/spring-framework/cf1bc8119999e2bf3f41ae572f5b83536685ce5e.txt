Introduce LookupPath in WebFlux request routing

This commit adds the `LookupPath` class that contains the full
request path relative to the web context; the application can
get from it various information, including the file extension
and path parameters (if any).

Since that operation is done multiple times for each request, this
object is stored as an attribute at the `ServerWebExchange` level.
