Fix FreeMarker form checbox macro generated names

In Spring 3.2 a fix was implemented for all Spring Freemarker form
macros so that generated form input fields have valid bracketless IDs.
In the fix a regression was introduced manifesting in formCheckbox
macro no longer generating appropriate names for checkbox and hidden
input field.

This change fixes mentioned regression issue.
