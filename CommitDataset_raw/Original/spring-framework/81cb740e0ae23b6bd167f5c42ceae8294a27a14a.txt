New postProcessProperties variant on InstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessor

Allows for skipping the now-deprecated postProcessPropertyValues callback with its expensive PropertyDescriptor retrieval requirement. RequiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor (which is dependent on postProcessPropertyValues) and the @Required annotation itself are also deprecated now: in favor of constructor injection (or afterPropertiesSet).

Issue: SPR-16918
