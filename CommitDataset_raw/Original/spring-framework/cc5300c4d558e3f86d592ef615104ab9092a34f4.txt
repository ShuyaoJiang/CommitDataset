Align MVC checkNotModified with reactive support

Since SPR-14522, the web reactive framework supports checkNotModified
features. This commit aligns the existing MVC infrastructure with
web reactive's behavior.

Because of the new Servlet 3.0 baseline, some constraints
aren't relevant anymore and duplicate code has been removed in
`HttpEntityMethodProcessor`.

Issue: SPR-14659
