Fix absolute paths when transforming resources

Prior to this commit, `ResourceTransformerSupport.toAbsolutePath`
would call `StringUtils.applyRelativePath` in all cases. But this
implementation is prepending the given path even if the relative path
starts with `"/"`.

This commit skips the entire operation if the given path is absolute,
i.e. it starts with `"/"`.

Issue: SPR-17432
