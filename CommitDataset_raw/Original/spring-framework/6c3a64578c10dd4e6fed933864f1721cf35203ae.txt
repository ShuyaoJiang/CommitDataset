Move ResolvableType from HttpEntity to PublisherEntity

This commit moves the ResolvableType field from HttpEntity to
PublisherEntity, a new entity type defined in MultipartBodyBuilder.
With this change, the scope of the ResolvableType is limited to
multipart-related code, instead of becoming part of the complete
HttpEntity hierarchy.

Issue: SPR-16307
