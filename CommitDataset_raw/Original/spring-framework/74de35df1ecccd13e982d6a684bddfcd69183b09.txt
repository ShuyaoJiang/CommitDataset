Refactor async result handling in Spring MVC Test

This change removes the use of a CountDownLatch to wait for the
asynchronously computed controller method return value. Instead we
check in a loop every 200 milliseconds if the result has been set.
If the result is not set within the specified amount of time to wait
an IllegalStateException is raised.

Additional changes:
 - Use AtomicReference to hold the async result
 - Remove @Ignore annotations on AsyncTests methods
 - Remove checks for the presence of Servlet 3
