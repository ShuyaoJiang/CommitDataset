Delete unnecessary redeclaration of test methods

This commit deletes methods in RollbackForRequiredEjbTxDaoTestNGTests
that were unnecessarily redeclared. The redeclaration is required for
JUnit's @FixMethodOrder support but not for TestNG's built-in support
for dependent methods.

Issue: SPR-6132
