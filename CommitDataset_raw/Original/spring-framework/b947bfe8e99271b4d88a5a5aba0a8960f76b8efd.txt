Support of HTTP persistent connections for JDK client

Prior to this commit, HTTP clients relying on the JDK HTTP client would
not properly reuse existing TCP connections (i.e. HTTP 1.1 persisten
connection). The SimpleClientHttpResponse would close the actual connection once the
response is handled.

As explained in the JDK documentation
(http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/net/http-keepalive.html)
HTTP clients should do the following to allow resource reuse:

* consume the whole HTTP response content
* close the response inputstream once done

This commit makes sure that the response content is
totally drained and then the stream closed (and not the connection).

Issue: SPR-14040
