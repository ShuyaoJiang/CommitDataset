ResponseBodyResultHandler ignores ResponseEntity

Currently ResponseEntityResultHandler is ordered lower than
ResponseBodyResultHandler by default whch means a ResponseEntity
should not be picked by the ResponseBodyResultHandler.

However as it is easy to have both ResponseEntity and @ResponseBody
e.g. in @RestControler (or even by mistake) and in general it makes
sense for ResponseBodyResultHandler to explicitly recognize and
ignore the ResponseEntity return type.
