Refined caching of AntPathStringMatcher per pattern

Introduced a "setCachePatterns(boolean)" method for explicit configuration, a default turnoff threshold at 65536 entries (at which point we're deciding that caching isn't worthwhile because patterns are unlikely to be reoccurring often enough), and an "AntPathStringMatcher getStringMatcher(String pattern)" template method.

Issue: SPR-10803
