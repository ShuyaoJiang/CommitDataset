Delete spring-context's dependency on spring-beans-groovy

Commit 5648fbfc3155ddf4ead7388cfd7bc9e90b86f9d8 introduced a
compile-time dependency on spring-beans-groovy in the spring-context
module which breaks the build on the CI server since the Animal Sniffer
task cannot find a JAR file for spring-beans-groovy.

This commit reverts that change so that the "sniffer" task once again
succeeds.
