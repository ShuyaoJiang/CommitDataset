Remove Guava cache support

This commit removes `GuavaCache` and support classes. Caffeine supersedes
the caching support in the Google Guava library with an actively maintained
Java 8+ version in standalone form.

As it is the only Guava feature Spring framework integrates with, this
commit removes effectively any reference to Guava.

Issue: SPR-13797
