Allow @ContextConfiguration to be omitted

Prior to this commit, the @ContextConfiguration annotation was required
to be present even if default XML files, Groovy scripts, or
@Configuration classes were detected; however, in such cases the
@ContextConfiguration was typically declared empty and therefore
seemingly unnecessary boilerplate.

This commit permits @ContextConfiguration to be omitted whenever it can
be reasonably deduced. Consequently, integration tests such as the
following are now supported.

    @RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
    public class MyTest {

        @Autowired String myBean;

        @Test public void example() { /* ... */ }

        @Configuration
        static class Config {

            @Bean String myBean() {
                return "Hello";
            }
        }
    }
