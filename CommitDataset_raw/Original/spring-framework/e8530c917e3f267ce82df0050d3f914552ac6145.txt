Add Smile and CBOR Jackson data formats support

This commit adds Smile and CBOR Jackson HttpMessageConverters
and make it possible to create Smile and CBOR ObjectMapper via
Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder, which now allows to specify any
custom JsonFactory.

Like with JSON and XML Jackson support, the relevant
HttpMessageConverters are automaticially configurered by
Spring MVC WebMvcConfigurationSupport if jackson-dataformat-smile
or jackson-dataformat-cbor dependencies are found in the classpath.

Issue: SPR-14435
