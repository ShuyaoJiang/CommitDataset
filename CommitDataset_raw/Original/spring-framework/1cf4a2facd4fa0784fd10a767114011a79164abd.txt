Add ExceptionHandlerSupport class

The new class is functionally equivalent to the
DefaultHandlerExceptionResolver (i.e. it translates Spring MVC
exceptions to various status codes) but uses an @ExceptionHandler
returning a ResponseEntity<Object>, which means it can be customized to
write error content to the body of the response.
