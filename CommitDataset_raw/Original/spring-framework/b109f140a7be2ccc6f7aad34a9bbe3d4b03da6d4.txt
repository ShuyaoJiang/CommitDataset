Improve documentation for annotation filters with component scanning

Prior to this commit the documentation for annotation-based include and
exclude filters used with component scanning did not explicitly mention
the fact that annotations are considered a match if they are either
present or meta-present on candidate classes.

This commit improves the documentation in this regard.
