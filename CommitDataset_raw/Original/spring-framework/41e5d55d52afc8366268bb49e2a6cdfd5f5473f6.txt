Fix bridge method detection for class hierarchies

Prior to this change, @Autowired injection against an instance of a
subclass having different visibility than its superclass would fail
if the @Autowired method is declared only in the superclass. This is due
to an apparent change in the rules around bridge method generation
between Java 5 and Java 6, and possibly even varying across compiler
vendors.

Now, BridgeMethodResolver is used consistently when detecting
@Autowired, @Inject and @Resource metadata to bypass these bridge
methods if they exist.
