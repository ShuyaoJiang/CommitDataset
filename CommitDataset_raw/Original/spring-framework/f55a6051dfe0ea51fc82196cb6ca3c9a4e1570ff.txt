Document default embedded value resolver support for property
placeholders

Spring 4.3 introduced support for registering a default embedded value
resolver for the default environment, in case of none having been
registered through post-processors (like PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer
and PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer. However, the existing
documentation – stating that a static
PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer bean is required in order for
values coming from @PropertySource declarations to be honored – was not
updated to reflect the change.

This commit addresses this by updating the JavaDoc for @Configuration
and @PropertySource accordingly
