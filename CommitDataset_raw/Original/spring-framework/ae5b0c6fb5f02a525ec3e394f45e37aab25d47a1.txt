Replace J2EE with Java EE

String with version 5 the name of Java Platform, Enterprise Edition
changed from J2EE to Java EE. However a lot of the documentation still
uses the term J2EE.

This commit includes the following changes:

 * replace J2EE with Java EE where appropriate

This is not a blind search and replace. The following occurrences
remain unchanged:

 * references to old J2EE releases, most notably 1.3 and 1.4.
 * references to "Expert One-On-One J2EE Design and Development"
 * references to "Core J2EE patterns"
 * XML namespaces
 * package names
