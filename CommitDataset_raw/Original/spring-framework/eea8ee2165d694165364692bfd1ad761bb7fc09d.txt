Migrate JSP tag library appendix reference to Javadoc.

The Javadoc on tag classes now has all the information including a
list of all tags at the package level, HTML tables listing tag
attributes in each tag class, and class level description that is
as good or in many cases better than what was in the reference.

Issue: SPR-16045
