Support custom HTTP verbs in Spring MVC Test

Prior to this commit, Spring MVC Test only supported HTTP methods GET,
POST, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, TRACE and multipart file
upload. This change adds generic methods to MockMvcRequestBuilders in
order to allow testing of arbitrary HTTP methods in a Spring MVC
application.
