Add Jackson's Modules registration in Jackson2OMFactoryBean

Prior to this commit, one couldn't configure Jackson's ObjectMapper
with (De)SerializerModifiers or advanced configuration features
using XML configuration.

This commit updates the FactoryBean and adds a setModule method
that will register Modules with the ObjectMapper.

Note that this commit is only about XML configuration, since
this feature was already available with JavaConfig.

Issue: SPR-10429
