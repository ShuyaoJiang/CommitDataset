Update thread pool settings in STOMP/WebSocket config

The clientInboundChannel and clientOutboundChannel now use twice
the number of available processors by default to accomodate for some
degree of blocking in task execution on average.

In practice these settings still need to be configured explicitly in
applications but these should serve as better default values than
the default values in ThreadPoolTaskExecutor.
