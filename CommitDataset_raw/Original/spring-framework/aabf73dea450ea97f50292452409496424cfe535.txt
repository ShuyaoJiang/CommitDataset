Add Commons Pool 2 support

Deprecated CommonsPoolTargetSource (supporting commons pool 1.5+) in
favor of CommonsPool2TargetSource with a similar contract.

Commons Pool 2.x uses object equality while Commons Pool 1.x used
identity equality. This clearly means that Commons Pool 2 behaves
differently if several instances having the same identity according to
their `Object#equals(Object)` method are managed in the same pool. To
provide a smooth upgrade, a backward-compatible pool is created by
default; use `setUseObjectEquality(boolean)` if you need the standard
Commons Pool 2.x behavior.
