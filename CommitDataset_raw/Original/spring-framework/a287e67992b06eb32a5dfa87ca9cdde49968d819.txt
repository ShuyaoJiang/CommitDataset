Introduce 'useRegisteredExtensionsOnly' property in classes using MediaTypeFactory

This commit introduces a `useRegisteredExtensionsOnly` property that
indicates whether classes that use the `MediaTypeFactory` for supplying
default media types can do so.

 - In classes that were introduced in Spring 5.0, the
 `useRegisteredExtensionsOnly` property takes the place of the
 `useJaf` property that was removed in 0aaa652
 - In classes that existed before Spring 5.0, the
 `useRegisteredExtensionsOnly` property is added in addition to the
 deprecated `useJaf`, the latter delegating to the former, but with
 flipped behavior.

Issue: SPR-14908
