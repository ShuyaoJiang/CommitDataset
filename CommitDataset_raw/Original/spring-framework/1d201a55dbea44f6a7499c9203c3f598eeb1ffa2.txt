Refine PathContainer.Segment value representation

Segment.value() now returns the actual original path segment value
including path parameters while semicolonContent() is removed.

valueDecoded() is renamed to valueToMatch() to reflect it is the value
for pattern matching which is not only decoded but also has path
parameters removed.
