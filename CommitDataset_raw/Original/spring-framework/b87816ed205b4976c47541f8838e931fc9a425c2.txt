Add ResolvableTypeProvider

Provide a mean to detect the actual ResolvableType based on a instance as
a counter measure to type erasure.

Upgrade the event infrastructure to detect if the event (or the payload)
implements such interface. When this is the case, the return value of
`getResolvableType` is used to validate its generic type against the
method signature of the listener.
