Add copyToUriComponentsBuilder method

After this change UriComponentsBuilder#uriComponents method no longer
no longer copies from the given UriComponents but rather lets the
UriComponents instance copy itself to the UriComponentsBuilder.

This avoids the need for instanceof checks and also makes it possible
to distinguish between path and path segments, which otherwise is
internal knowledge of UriComponentsBuilder.
