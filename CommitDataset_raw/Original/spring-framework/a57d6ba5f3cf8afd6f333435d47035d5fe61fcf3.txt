Optimize StringUtils.cleanPath

Add an early exit to `StringUtils.cleanPath` to save array creating and
string concatenation. With a typical Spring application, the `cleanPath`
method can be called over 600 times, often with a path constructed by
a `ClassPathResource` that is likely to already be clean.
