Refactor VersionResourceResolver in strategies

Prior to this commit, one of the available strategies for resolving
resources was the PrefixResourceResolver. Reconsidering the core goal of
this resolver and the FingerprintResourceResolver, we found that the
true core feature is versioning static resources application-wide.

This commit refactors both Resolvers by:
* having only on VersionResourceResolver
* that resolver takes a mapping of paths -> VersionStrategy
* provided VersionStrategy implementations are ContentBasedVS
  (previously FingerprintRR), FixedVS (previously PrefixRR)

One can add a VersionResourceResolver like this:

  Map<String, VersionStrategy> versionStrategies = new HashMap<>();
  versionStrategies.put("/**/*.js", new PrefixVersionStrategy("prefix"));
  versionStrategies.put("/**", new ContentBasedVersionStrategy());

  VersionResourceResolver versionResolver = new VersionResourceResolver();
  versionResolver.setVersionStrategyMap(versionStrategies);

  List<ResourceResolver> resolvers = new ArrayList<ResourceResolver>();
  resolvers.add(versionResolver);
  resolvers.add(new PathResourceResolver());
