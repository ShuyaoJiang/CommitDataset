Support opaque URIs in UriComponentsBuilder

Before this commit, UriComponentsBuilder did not handle opaque URIs at
all. After this commit it does.

Support is introduced by making UriComponents an abstract base class,
and having two concrete subclasses: HierarchicalUriComponents and
OpaqueUriComponents. The former is more or less the same as the old
UriComponents class.

Issue: SPR-9798
