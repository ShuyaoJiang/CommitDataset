 - Eliminate trailing whitespace

 - Update long method signatures to follow framework whitespace
   conventions

   Based on the following search,

       $ git grep -A3 '^.public .* .*([^\{;]*$' */src/main

   the strong convention throughout the framework when dealing with
   methods having long signatures (i.e. many parameters) is to break
   immediately after the opening paren, indent two tabs deeper and break
   lines around 90 characters as necessary. Such signatures should also
   be followed by a newline after the opening curly brace to break
   things up visually.

   The files edited in this commit had a particularly different style of
   intenting arguments to align with each other vertically, but the
   alignment only worked if one's tabstop is set at four spaces.
   When viewed at a different tabstop value, the effect is is jarring,
   both in that it is misaligned and significantly different from most
   of the framework. The convention described above reads well at any
   tabstop value.
