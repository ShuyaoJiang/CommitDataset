Add value-type attrib to beans->map->entry element

Previously, the <value> subelement of a map <entry> allowed one to
specify the type of a specific map entry value. This patch allows a
value-type attribute as well, such that instead of the following
syntax

    <entry key="x-message-ttl">
        <value type="java.lang.Long">100</value>
    </entry>
    <entry key="x-ha-policy" value="all" />

one can now use the more concise form

    <entry key="x-message-ttl" value="100" value-type="java.lang.Long"/>
    <entry key="x-ha-policy" value="all"/>

The new value-type attribute may be used at the <map> level as well,
indicating that all elements are of the same type.

Appropriate tests have been added exercising value-type at the <map> and
<entry> levels.
