Throw exception for illegal PathMatch configurations

With the new `ParsingPathMatcher` implementation, new patterns are now
allowed, such as `"/foo/{*bar}". The `"{*bar}"` segment will capture
everything until the end of the given path. Adding other elements after
that segment is illegal and will throw exceptions.

One can configure on a `PathMatchConfigurer` various options like
`useTrailingSlashMatch` and `useSuffixPatternMatch`; those options, when
enabled, will try to append suffixes like `".*"` and `"/"` to existing
path patterns. In case of a "capture the rest" pattern segment, those
options won't be honored.

This is why this commit ensures that an exception is thrown at the start
of the application if an illegal configuration is applied to the
`PathMatchConfigurer`.
