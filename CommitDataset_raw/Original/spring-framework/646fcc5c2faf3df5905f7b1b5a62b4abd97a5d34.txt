Support Custom Headers for Multipart Async Data

This commit makes sure there is no custom Content-Disposition header
before setting one automatically.

This commit also adds a headers(Consumer<HttpHeaders>) method, so that
one can user the nicer methods of HttpHeaders, as opposed to basic
strings.

Issue: SPR-16376
