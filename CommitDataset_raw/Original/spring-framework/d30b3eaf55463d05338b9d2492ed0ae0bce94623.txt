Add STOMP client

WebSocketStompClient can be used with any implementation of
org.springframework.web.socket.client.WebSocketClient, which includes
org.springframework.web.socket.sockjs.client.SockJsClient.

Reactor11TcpStompClient can be used with reactor-net and provides STOMP
over TCP. It's also possible to adapt other WebSocket and TCP client
libraries (see StompClientSupport for more details).

For example usage see WebSocketStompClientIntegrationTests.
