Remove XFire reference documentation (SPR-7434)

XFire is now CXF (per http://xfire.codehaus.org), and given that Spring
does not actually ship with any explicit XFire support, it makes sense
to remove the documentation completely.  CXF does provide support for
writing services with Spring, and they provide their own documentation.

See http://cxf.apache.org/docs/writing-a-service-with-spring.html
