Refactor BindingContext initialization

In preparation for SPR-15132.

Turn the BindingContextFactory into ModelInitializer (both package
private) since creating BindingContext itself is quite simple.

The ModelInitializer also has only one field and no need to be aware
of fields the RequestMappingHandlerAdapter.
