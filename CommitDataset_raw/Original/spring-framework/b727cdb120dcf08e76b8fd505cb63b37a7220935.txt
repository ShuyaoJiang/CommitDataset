Adjust ActiveMQ settings in integration tests

Before this change tests on the CI server showed the following message:

Store limit is 102400 mb, whilst the data directory:
/opt/.../KahaDB only has 74810 mb of usable space

This change turns off store persistence and also explicitly sets the
limit on memory usage.
