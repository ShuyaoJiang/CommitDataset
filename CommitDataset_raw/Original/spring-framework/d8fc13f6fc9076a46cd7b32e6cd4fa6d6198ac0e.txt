Fix server errors for invalid If-None-Match request headers

HttpEntityMethodProcessor should not throw IllegalArgumentExceptions for
invalid If-None-Match headers.

For those cases, this commit makes sure that both
`HttpEntityMethodProcessor` and `ServletWebRequest` have a consistent
behavior and stop processing the request as conditional and leave the
handler handle it.

Issue: SPR-14559
