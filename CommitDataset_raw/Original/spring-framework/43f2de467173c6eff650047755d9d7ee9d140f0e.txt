Defensive checks in WebClient and Reactor connector

Since there is no reason for an exchange to ever complete without a
ClientResponse I've added a switchIfEmpty check at the WebClient level.

Also, temporarily a second check closer to the problem in the
ReactorClientHttpConnector suggesting a workaround and providing a
reference to the Reactor Netty issue #138.

Issue: SPR-15784
