Buffer leak fixes

Address issues where buffers are allocated (and cached somehow) at or
before subscription, and before explicit demand.

The commit adds tests proving the leaks and fixes. The common thread
for all tests is a "zero demand" subscriber that subscribes  but does
not request, and then cancels without consuming anything.

Closes gh-22107
