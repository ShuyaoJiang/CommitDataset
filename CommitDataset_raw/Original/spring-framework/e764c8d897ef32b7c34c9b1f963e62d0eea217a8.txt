Fix synchronization issue in StompSubProtocolHandler

Two concurrent threads should not send a message on a single WebSocket
session at the same time, for example see:
http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/websocket/RemoteEndpoint.Basic.html

In StompSubProtocolHandler it is quite possible that multiple messages
may be broadcast to a single WebSocket client concurrently.

This change adds synchronization around the sending of a message to a
specific cilent session.
