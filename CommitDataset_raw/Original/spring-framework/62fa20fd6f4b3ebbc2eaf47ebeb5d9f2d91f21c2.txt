PathPattern#matchAndExtract minor refactoring

Consistent behavior with matches(PathContainer), the two had slightly
different logic for handling of empty paths.

Make matchAndExtract independantly usable without the need to call
matches(PathContainer) first. Essentially no longer raising ISE if the
pattern doesn't match but simply returning null.
