HttpHeaders fails getAllow if set to EmptyCollection

Prior to this commit, calls to getAllow would fail is setAllow was set
to an EmptyCollection right before.

    java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No enum constant
    org.springframework.http.HttpMethod

This commit fixes this by testing the header value for an empty value
before trying to use it to get a value from the Enum.

Issue: SPR-11917
