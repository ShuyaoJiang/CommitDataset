Consolidate view resolution under result.view

While View and ViewResolver play the same role as in spring-webmvc they
are now abstracted behind the HandlerResultHandler abstraction so that
top-level contracts don't reference them and the DispatcherHandler is
also unaware of their existence.

Furthermore view resolution and response body handling which are now at
the same level of abstraction (each is a HandlerResultHandler) will
also share code for content negotiation, so it makes sense for them to
be side by side.

This commit moves the reactive.view package to reactive.result.view
with the View and ViewResolver contracts (previously in the top-level
reactive package) also moving there.
