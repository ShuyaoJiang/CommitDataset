Update Eclipse import organization rules

The following changes have been made to the JDT UI prefs to conform to
existing conventions throughout the codebase:

 - always favor .* syntax for static imports
 - always list static imports last

Re-run `gradle eclipse` and refresh projects within Eclipse to make
this change take effect.
