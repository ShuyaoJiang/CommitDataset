Add allowHeader property to WebContentGenerator

The WebContentGenerator now maintains an additional property that
sub-classes can use for an "Allow" header in response to an HTTP
OPTIONS request. This property is pre-initialized once at startup
and does not have to rely on getSupportedMethods in addition to
adding HTTP OPTIONS if not explicitly listed.
