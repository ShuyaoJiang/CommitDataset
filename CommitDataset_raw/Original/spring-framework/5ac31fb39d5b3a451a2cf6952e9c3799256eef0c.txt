Refactor HTTP Range support with ResourceRegion

Prior to this commit, the `ResourceHttpMessageConverter` would support
all HTTP Range requests and `MethodProcessors` would "wrap" controller
handler return values with a `HttpRangeResource` to support that use
case in Controllers.

This commit refactors that support in several ways:
* a new ResourceRegion class has been introduced
* a new, separate, ResourceRegionHttpMessageConverter handles the HTTP
range use cases when serving static resources with the
ResourceHttpRequestHandler
* the support of HTTP range requests on Controller handlers has been
removed until a better solution is found

Issue: SPR-14221, SPR-13834
