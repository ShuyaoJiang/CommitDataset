Allow MvcUriComponentsBuilder instance with baseUrl

Before this change MvcUriComponentsBuilder exposed only static factory
methods for creating links where the links are relative to the current
request or a baseUrl explicitly provided as an argument.

This change allows creating an MvcUriComponents builder instance with
a built-in baseUrl. The instance can then be used with non-static
withXxx(...) method alternatives to the static fromXxx(...) methods.
