Add script after setting scripts in RsrcDbPopultr

Prior to this commit it was impossible to add additional scripts to a
ResourceDatabasePopulator after setScripts() had been invoked.

This commit fixes this by ensuring that the internal scripts list
continues to be modifiable when setScripts() is invoked.

Issue: SPR-11691
