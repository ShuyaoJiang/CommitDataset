Disable HTTP Range support for InputStreamResource

Prior to this commit, the `AbstractMessageConverterMethodProcessor`
would fail to convert `InputStreamResource` to `ResourceRegion` as
expected, since the content length cannot be read without consuming the
stream. This is enforced by the `HttpRange` class.

Now the method processor would still try to output HTTP range response
headers to provide range support information. This step is using the
resource content length and reads the input stream, leading to
exceptions such as "IllegalStateException: InputStream has already been
read".

This commit improves the return type detection and excludes early
`InputStreamResource` return types. With those types, HTTP range support
is now completely disabled.
