Fix context-relative default value in XML parsing

This commit fixes the default value for the contextRelative attribute of
a RedirectView, when this view is registered via a
RedirectViewController in XML. The value is set to true.

Note that the default value for this is correctly documented in
spring-mvc-4.1.xsd. Also, the documentation and implementation for its
javadoc counterpart also enforces true as a default value.

Issue: SPR-12607
