Improve initialization of Assume class

Prior to this commit, the org.springframework.tests.Assume class could
fail to load resulting in a NoClassDefFoundError if parsing of the
'testGroups' system property failed. This is because the parsing took
place while initializing a static field.

This commit addresses this issue by moving the 'testGroups' system
property lookup to a dedicated method that is lazily invoked upon
demand instead of eagerly when loading the Assume class itself.

In addition, when an error occurs, TestGroup.parse() now logs the
complete original value of the supplied test groups string instead of
potentially omitting the "all-" prefix. This results in more
informative error messages similar to the following.

  java.lang.IllegalStateException: Failed to parse 'testGroups' system
  property: Unable to find test group 'bogus' when parsing testGroups
  value: 'all-bogus'. Available groups include:
  [LONG_RUNNING,PERFORMANCE,JMXMP,CI]

Issue: SPR-15163
