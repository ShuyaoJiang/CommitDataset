BadRequestStatusException -> ServerWebInputException

The renaming makes it clear this exception is for use where 400 error
applies within a Spring web application where the error may be
associated with a MethodParameter, a BindingResult, and so on.

There is no need for BadRequestStatusException which can be expressed
with ResponseStatusException(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST, "reason").
