Various improvements to web.reactive.function

This commit introduces the following changes to web.reactive.function:

- Added RouterFunction.andRoute(), a combination of RouterFunction.and()
with RouterFunctions.route()
- ServerRequest.pathVariable() returns String instead of
Optional<String>. An exception is thrown if the variable is not present.
- Added HandlerFilterFunction.andThen and HandlerFilterFunction.apply()
