Fix empty URLs handling in ResourceUrlEncodingFilter

Prior to this commit, the ResourceUrlEncodingFilter would fail with a
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException when:

* the current request has a servlet context
* the URL to encode is relative and is shorter than the context value

This change defensively checks for those lengths and delegates to the
parent implementation if necessary.

Issue: SPR-13018
