Protect against non-deterministic method order in JDK7

 - Allow reset of GlobalAdvisorAdapterRegistry

   Provide a reset() method allowing the GlobalAdvisorAdapterRegistry
   instance to be replaced with a fresh instance. This method has
   primarily been added to allow unit tests to leave the registry
   in a known state.

 - Protect against the fact that calls to configuration class methods
   my occur in a random order.
