Merge branch '3.1.x'

This is the first merge from 3.1.x => master after the Gradle build
system migration. Notice how files changed under the 3.1.x directory
structure (org.springframework.*) merge seamlessly into the new
directory structure (spring-*).

Certain files had changed under 3.1.x that have since been deleted with
the Gradle build migration, e.g. all pom.xml files had <license>
sections added. These files showed up as a conflict during the merge,
but the resolution is to simply re-remove them and commit as they are
no longer relevant under 3.2.x / master.

Also noteworthy is the .gitignore file. It has been updated under 3.1.x
to ignore files and directories specific to the new Gradle-based
structure. However, this causes conflicts when trying to merge against
master, given that master should *not* ignore this directories. The
resolution in this situation is to simply force the 'master' version of
the file, i.e. when prompted for merge resolution:

    anakata:~/Work/spring-framework/spring-framework[master|MERGING]
    $ git status -sb
    ## master...springsource/master [ahead 24]
    UU .gitignore

    anakata:~/Work/spring-framework/spring-framework[master|MERGING]
    $ git checkout master .gitignore

    anakata:~/Work/spring-framework/spring-framework[master|MERGING]
    $ git commit

It is helpful in situations like this one to enable git's "rerere"
feature beforehand, which records and remembers resolution strategies,
avoiding the need to repeat them in future merges:

    $ git config --global rerere.enabled 1
