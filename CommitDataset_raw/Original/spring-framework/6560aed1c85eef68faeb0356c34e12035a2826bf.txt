Avoid JMSException in listener execution

This commit avoids throwing JMSException from the listener execution
as this is not allowed per spec. Our SessionAwareMessageListener
gives a callback that can throw JMSException and we have "abused" it
so far.

Typical message processing goes in those 3 steps:
* Unmarshall the javax.jms.Message to the requested type
* Invoke the actual user method (including processing of method
  arguments)
* Send a reply message, if any

Those three steps have been harmonized so that they don't throw a
JMSException anymore. For the later case, introduced
ReplyFailureException as a general exception indicating the
reply message could not have been sent.

Issue: SPR-11778
