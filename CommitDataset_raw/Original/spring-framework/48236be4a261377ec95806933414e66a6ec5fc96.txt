STOMP and WebSocket messaging related logging updates

This change removes most logging at INFO level and also ensures the
amount of information logged at DEBUG level is useful, brief, and
not duplicated.

Also added is custom logging for STOMP frames to ensure very readable
and consise output.

Issue: SPR-11934
