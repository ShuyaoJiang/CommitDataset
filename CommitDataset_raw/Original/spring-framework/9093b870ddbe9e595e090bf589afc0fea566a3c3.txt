Move mavenLocal() to bottom of repositories list

This commit moves mavenLocal() to the bottom of the repositories list
so that Gradle's Eclipse IDE support will properly link binary JARs to
their source JARS in generated Eclipse .classpath files.

According to Gradle experts, "`mavenLocal` should basically never be
the first repo in the list."
