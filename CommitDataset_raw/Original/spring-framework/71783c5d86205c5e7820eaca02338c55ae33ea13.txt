Allow default settings of a custom HttpClient to apply

Previously the default settings of a custom HttpClient were always
ignored since a RequestConfig instance was always set no matter if
some customizations were applied or not.

This commit keeps an internal RequestConfig object instance that is
only initialized if the user applies a customization. If he does not, the
default settings of the HttpClient are used as it should.

Note that if the HttpComponents API exposed the default RequestConfig
of a given HttpClient, we would be able to merge our customizations with
the one specified by the client. Unfortunately, such API does not exist
and the "defaultSettingsOfHttpClientLostOnExecutorCustomization" test
illustrates that limitation.
