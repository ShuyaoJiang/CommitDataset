Introduce ActiveProfilesResolver in the TCF

Prior to this commit, the active bean definition profiles to use when
loading an ApplicationContext for tests could only be configured
declaratively (i.e., via hard-coded values supplied to the 'value' or
'profiles' attribute of @ActiveProfiles).

This commit makes it possible to programmatically configure active bean
definition profiles in tests via a new ActiveProfileResolver interface.
Custom resolvers can be registered via a new 'resolver' attribute
introduced in @ActiveProfiles.

Overview of changes:

 - Introduced a new ActiveProfilesResolver API.
 - Added a 'resolver' attribute to @ActiveProfiles.
 - Updated ContextLoaderUtils.resolveActiveProfiles() to support
   ActiveProfilesResolvers.
 - Documented these new features in the reference manual.
 - Added new content to the reference manual regarding the
   'inheritProfiles' attribute of @ActiveProfiles
 - Removed the use of <lineannotation> Docbook markup in the testing
   chapter of the reference manual for Java code examples in order to
   allow comments to have proper syntax highlighting in the generated
   HTML and PDF.
