Re-enable ignored SecurityManager-related test

Prior to this change, CallbacksSecurityTests#testContainerPrivileges was
@Ignored because it caused the build to fail under Gradle. After some
analysis, the root cause was determined to be the fact that (a) a
restrictive SecurityManager is active during the running of this test,
and (b), Gradle intercepts System.out and routes it through its internal
LogBack-based logging system. LogBack requires a call to
Class#getClassLoader when handling logging statements, and the
SecurityManager disallows this call, thus raising the error that fails
the build.

This commit solves the problem by eliminating the System.out.println
call in question and removing the @Ignore annotation from the test. The
console output was diagnostic in nature anyway, and not required for the
successful execution of the test's assertions.
