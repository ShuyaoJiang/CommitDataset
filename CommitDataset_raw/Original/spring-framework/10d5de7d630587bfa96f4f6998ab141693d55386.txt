Handle special headers in Tomcat and Jetty

This commit adds special processing of some HTTP response headers in
Jetty and Tomcat; they both consider some headers like  "Content-Length"
as specific and require explicit calls on the `HttpServletResponse`
itself on top of setting the HTTP response header.

Issue: SPR-17250
