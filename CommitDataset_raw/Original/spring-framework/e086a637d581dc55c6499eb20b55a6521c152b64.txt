Introduce BEFORE METHOD/CLASS modes in @DirtiesContext

Prior to this commit, @DirtiesContext could only be used to close a
test ApplicationContext after an entire test class or after a test
method; however, there are some use cases for which it would be
beneficial to close a test ApplicationContext before a given test class
or test method -- for example, if some rogue (i.e., yet to be
determined) test within a large test suite has corrupted the original
configuration for the ApplicationContext.

This commit provides a solution to such testing challenges by
introducing the following modes for @DirtiesContext.

 - MethodMode.BEFORE_METHOD: configured via the new methodMode attribute

 - ClassMode.BEFORE_CLASS and ClassMode.BEFORE_EACH_TEST_METHOD: both
   configured via the existing classMode attribute
