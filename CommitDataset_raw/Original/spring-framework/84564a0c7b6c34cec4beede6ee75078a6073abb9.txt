Rework @PropertySource early parsing logic

Rework the @PropertySource parsing logic recently changed in commit
7c608886 to deal with the same source appearing on a @Configuration
class and an @Import class.

Processing now occurs in a single sweep, with any previously added
sources being converted to a CompositePropertySource.
