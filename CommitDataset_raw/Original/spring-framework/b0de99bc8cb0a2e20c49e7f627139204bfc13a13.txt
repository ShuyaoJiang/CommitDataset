Refactor ResponseBodySubscriber to Processor

This commit changes the AbstractResponseBodySubscriber into a
AbstractResponseBodyProcessor<DataBuffer, Void>, so that the processor
can be used as a return value for writeWith.

Additional, this commit no longer closes the response after an eror
occurred.

This fixes #59.
