Remove synchronized keywords from SockJsSession impls

Before this change SockJsSession implementations of WebSocketSession
used synchronization around its method implementations protecting
internal state and ensuring only a single thread is sending messages
at a time.

A WebSocketSession is generally expected to be used from one thread
at a time and now that application messages are sent through
ConcurrentWebSocketSessionDecorator, there is no concern about
application messages sent from the different threads.

While there are some remaining concerns, those can be addressed
without using the synchronized keyword. This change removes it from
the methods of all SockJS session implementations.
