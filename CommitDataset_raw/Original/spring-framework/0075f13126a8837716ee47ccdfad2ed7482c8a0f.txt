Improve CORS list properties combination logic

This commit allows CorsConfiguration#combine()
to differentiate permit default values set by
CorsConfiguration#applyPermitDefaultValues()
from values configured explicitly by the user.

Those permit default values will be overridden
by any user-provided ones while user-provided values
will be combined in an additive way, including
when "*" is specified.

Documentation has been improved accordingly.

Issue: SPR-15772
