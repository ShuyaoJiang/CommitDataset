Fix issue with parsing media types

Invalid Content-Type or Accept header values previously resulted in the
IllegalArgumentException getting propagated. After this change such
errors are detected and generally treated as a "no match", which
may for example result in a 406 in the case of the Accept header.

Issue: SPR-9148
