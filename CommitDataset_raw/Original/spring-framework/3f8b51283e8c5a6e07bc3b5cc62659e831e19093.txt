Support @Rollback on classes & deprecate @TxConfig

Since Spring Framework 2.5, @Rollback has been supported on test
methods, with class-level rollback settings configured via
@TransactionConfiguration; however, allowing @Rollback to be declared
on test classes with method-level declarations overriding class-level
declarations would prove more intuitive than having to declare both
@TransactionConfiguration and @Rollback. Furthermore, the
transactionManager flag in @TransactionConfiguration was made
superfluous many years ago with the introduction of support for a
qualifier in @Transactional.

This commit enables @Rollback to be declared at the class level for
default rollback semantics within test class hierarchies and deprecates
@TransactionConfiguration in favor of @Rollback and @Transactional
qualifiers.
