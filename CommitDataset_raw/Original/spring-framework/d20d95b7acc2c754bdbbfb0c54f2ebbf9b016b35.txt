Allow directly present @BootstrapWith to override meta annotations

Prior to this commit, if a test class was meta-annotated with multiple
@BootstrapWith declarations that registered different
TestContextBootstrapper implementations, such a configuration would
result in an IllegalStateException, and there was no way to override
this behavior.

This commit addresses this shortcoming by relaxing the explicit
TestContextBootstrapper resolution in BootstrapUtils so that a directly
present @BootstrapWith annotation will now override declarations of
@BootstrapWith that are meta-present. In other words, if @BootstrapWith
is used as a meta-annotation, it can be overridden directly on the test
class via an explicit, local declaration of @BootstrapWith.

Issue: SPR-17006
