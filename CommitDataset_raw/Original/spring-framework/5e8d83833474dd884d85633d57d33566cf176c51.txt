CORS-related refinements

After this change CorsProcessor has a single processRequest method and
it also explicitly deals with a null CorsConfiguration, which for
pre-flight requests results in a rejection while for simple requests
results in no CORS headers added.

The AbstractHandlerMapping now uses a LinkedHashMap to preserve the
order in which global patterns are provided.
