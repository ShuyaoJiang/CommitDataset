Introduce LoggingResultHandler in Spring MVC Test

Prior to this commit, the Spring MVC Test framework only provided
support for printing debug information about the MvcResult to STDOUT.

This commit introduces support for logging `MvcResult` details at
`DEBUG` level via the Apache Commons Logging API. In addition, this
commit introduces additional `print(..)` variants for printing debug
information to custom output streams and writers.

Specifically, `MockMvcResultHandlers` has been augmented with the
following new static methods:

 - `log()`
 - `print(OutputStream)`
 - `print(Writer)`

Issue: SPR-13171
