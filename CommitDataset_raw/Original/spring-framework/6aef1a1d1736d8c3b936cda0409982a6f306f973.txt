Fix ResourceUrlProvider path check in getForRequestUrl

Prior to this change, getForRequestUrl implementation would only work
for applications with a non-empty servlet path. So web applications
mapped to "/" would trigger a IllegalStateException while checking the
current request against the request path within the current mapping.

This change relaxes this and only check that the path within mapping is
within the request URL.
