Start migration annotation utility methods

Create internal variants of the existing `AnnotationUtils` and
`AnnotatedElementUtils` classes and migrate the existing classes to
use them.

The internal variants will be used to check that the same results are
given as we migrate the utils methods to use the new `MergedAnnotations`
API.
