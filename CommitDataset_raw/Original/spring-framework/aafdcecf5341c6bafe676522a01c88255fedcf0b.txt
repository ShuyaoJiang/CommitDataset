Customize connection request timeout

Prior to this commit it was not possible to easily customize the
connection request timeout used by the HttpClient. Both
`HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory` and
`HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactoryTests` have been updated to
support a `connectionRequestTimeout` property.

Issue: SPR-12166
