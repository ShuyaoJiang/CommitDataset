Polish scheduled task execution infrastructure

In anticipation of substantive changes required to implement "initial
delay" support in the <task:scheduled> element and @Scheduled
annotation, the following updates have been made to the components and
infrastructure supporting scheduled task execution:

 - Fix code style violations
 - Fix compiler warnings
 - Add Javadoc where missing, update to use {@code} tags, etc.
 - Organize imports to follow conventions
