Use PathPattern.getPathRemaining in WebFlux fn

This commit uses the newly introduced
`PathPattern.getPathRemaining(String)` in the functional web framework.
With this change, all path predicates can be used for nested router
functions, so the `pathPrefix` predicate is no longer required and has
been removed.
