Avoid NPE when registering a SpEL MethodFilter

Attempting to register a custom MethodFilter with a
StandardEvaluationContext after invoking setMethodResolvers() with a
custom list of MethodResolver instances results in a
NullPointerException. Based on the current documentation in
StandardEvaluationContext it is unclear what the expected behavior
should be, but either the implementation is broken, or the use case is
unsupported. In either case, allowing a NullPointerException to be
thrown is inappropriate.

This commit documents the fact that the SpEL MethodFilter is intended to
be used with the ReflectiveMethodResolver. Furthermore,
StandardEvaluationContext.registerMethodFilter() now throws an
IllegalStateException if the user attempts to set a filter after having
registered a custom set of resolvers.
