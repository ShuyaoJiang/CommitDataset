Revert resource handling changes

This change reverts recent commits made to expand the resource handling
mechanism in Spring MVC. The changes will move into a separate branch
and likely into a separate project allowing it to mature and evolve
without being tied to the main framework release schedule.

Issue: SPR-10933, SPR-10310
