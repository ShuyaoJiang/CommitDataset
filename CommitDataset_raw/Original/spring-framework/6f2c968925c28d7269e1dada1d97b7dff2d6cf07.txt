Support strict URI variable encoding

The DefaulUriTemplateHandler now provides a strictEncoding property
which if turned on encodes everything outside the reserved char set.

This is in contrast to the default policy of encoding only illegal
charaters depending on the URI component type.

Issue: SPR-11652
