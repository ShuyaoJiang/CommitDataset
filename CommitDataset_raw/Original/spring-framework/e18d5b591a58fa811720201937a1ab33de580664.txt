Limit size of context cache in the TestContext framework

Prior to this commit, the size of the ApplicationContext cache in the
Spring TestContext Framework could grow without bound, leading to
issues with memory and performance in large test suites.

This commit addresses this issue by introducing support for setting the
maximum cache size via a JVM system property or Spring property called
"spring.test.context.cache.maxSize". If no such property is set, a
default value of 32 will be used.

Furthermore, the DefaultContextCache has been refactored to use a
synchronized LRU cache internally instead of a ConcurrentHashMap. The
LRU cache is a simple bounded cache with a "least recently used" (LRU)
eviction policy.

Issue: SPR-8055
