Fix SerializableTypeWrapper equals() performance

Change SerializableTypeWrapper proxies to directly call equals() methods
on the underlying Type, rather than possibly generating more wrappers.

This should help to improve performance, especially as the equals()
method is called many times when the ResolvableType cache is checked.
