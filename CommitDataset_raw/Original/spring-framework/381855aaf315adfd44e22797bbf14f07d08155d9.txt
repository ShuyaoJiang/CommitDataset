Refine names in web.server and polish Javadoc

WebServerExchange -> ServerWebExchange

Follows the same convention as in the http package also better allowing
the possibility for a client equivalent in the future.

WebToHttpHandlerBuilder -> WebHttpHandlerBuilder
WebToHttpHandlerAdapter -> WebHttpHandlerAdapter

More consistent with Spring conventions.
