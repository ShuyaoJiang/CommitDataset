Support {/...} patterns in UriComponents(Builder)

This commit introduces support for "Path Segment URI Variable
expansion", see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570#section-3.2.6.
In practice, this means that URI template variables prefixed with a '/'
are treated like path segments and - as such - will encode any '/'
found. For example: {/foo} expanded with "bar/baz" with result in
"bar%2F".

Issue: SPR-12750
