Remove snapshot repository

reactor-netty-0.6.0.RELEASE on Maven Central depends on
reactor-ipc-0.6.0.RELEASE so no need for this repository anymore.

It may be needed to cleanup Gradle or Maven local cache
since preliminary version of reactor-netty-0.6.0.RELEASE
had a dependency on reactor-ipc-0.6.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.
