Use ContentNegotiationManager for static resources

The ResourceHttpRequestHandler now relies on the conifgured
ContentNegotiationManager to determine the content type for resource
requests rather than implementing that internally.

First we check against the matched resource based on the resource file
extension. Then we expand the check against the request with any
configured content negotiation strategy.
