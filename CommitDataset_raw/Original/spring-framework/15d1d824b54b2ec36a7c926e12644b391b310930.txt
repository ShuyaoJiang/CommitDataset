Return null correctly from MutablePropertySources#get

Prior to this commit, MutablePropertySources#get(String) would throw
IndexArrayOutOfBoundsException if the named property source does not
actually exist. This is a violation of the PropertySource#get contract
as described in its Javadoc.

The implementation now correctly checks for the existence of the named
property source, returning null if non-existent and otherwise returning
the associated PropertySource.
