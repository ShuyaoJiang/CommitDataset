Always pass test class to ActiveProfilesResolver

Prior to this commit, if @ActiveProfiles were used as a meta-annotation
on a composed annotation, then the composed annotation's class would be
passed to the ActiveProfilesResolver.resolve() method instead of the
test class, which breaks the contract for ActiveProfilesResolver.

This commit addresses this issue by ensuring that the actual test class
is always passed to ActiveProfilesResolver.resolve().

Issue: SPR-11467
