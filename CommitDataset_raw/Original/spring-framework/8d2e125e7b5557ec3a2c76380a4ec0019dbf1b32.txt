Fix [rawtypes] compiler warnings

 - Suppress rawtypes warnings for src/main
 - Enable rawtypes warnings for src/test

This commit attempts to to resolve all rawtypes problems across tests as
aggressively as possible, i.e. without regard for binary compatibility,
whereas main sources must be treated much more cautiously with an eye
toward compatibility.
