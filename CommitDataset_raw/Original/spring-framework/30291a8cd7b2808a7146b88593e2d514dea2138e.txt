Allow to customize TestDispatcherServlet

This commit introduces the `DispatcherServletCustomizer` callback
interface that can be used to customize the `DispatcherServlet` that a
`MockMvc` is using.

Previously, only the `dispatchOptions` flag can be customized. This
commit allows to customize any property of `DispatcherServlet` before it
is initialized.
