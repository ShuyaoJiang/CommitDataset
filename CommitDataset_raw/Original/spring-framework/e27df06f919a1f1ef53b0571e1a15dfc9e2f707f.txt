AnnotatedElementUtils consistently operates on actual annotation type if available (for performance reasons)

The goal is to avoid String name comparisons in favor of annotation type identity checks wherever possible. Also, we avoid double getDeclaredAnnotations/getAnnotations checks on anything other than Classes now, since we'd just get the same result in a fresh array.
