Delete superfluous fail() invocations in RequestResponseBodyMethodProcessorTests

Several test methods in RequestResponseBodyMethodProcessorTests
are currently annotated with @Test(expected=â€¦) and additionally contain:

    fail("Expected exception");

This combination is superfluous, and the unnecessary fail() invocations
have therefore been removed.
