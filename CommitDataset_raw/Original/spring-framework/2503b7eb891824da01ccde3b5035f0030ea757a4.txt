Fix property replacement bug in Log4jWebConfigurer

Previously, if the resolution of a ${...} placeholder resulted in a
valid URL for the location of a log4j properties/XML file, the URL
would ultimately be malformed by an unnecessary call to to
WebUtils#getRealPath.

The implementation of Log4jWebConfigurer#initLogging now eagerly
attempts SystemPropertyUtils#resolvePlaceholders before checking to see
if the location is a valid URL, and bypassing the call to
WebUtils#getRealPath if so.

Issue: SPR-9417
