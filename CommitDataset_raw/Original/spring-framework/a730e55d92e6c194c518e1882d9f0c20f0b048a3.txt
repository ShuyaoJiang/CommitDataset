Add support for Jackson 2.7

AbstractJackson2HttpMessageConverter now implements its own
TypeVariable resolution algorithm since in Jackson 2.7 it is now
deprecated and has not the same behavior .
See https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1087
for more details.

The dependency on jackson-datatype-jdk7 has been removed since
it is now provided by default in the jackson-databind module.

Issues: SPR-13483, SPR-13728
