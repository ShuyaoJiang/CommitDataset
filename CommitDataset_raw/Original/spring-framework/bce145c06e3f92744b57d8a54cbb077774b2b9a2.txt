Merged HttpClient defaults with local customizations

Update HttpComponents wrapper to merge local customizations with the
default of the current HttpClient instead of overriding everything.

This is available as from HttpComponents 4.4. that exposes the default
request config from the  client via the Configurable interface. If the
client does not implement such interface, the previous behaviour is
applied
