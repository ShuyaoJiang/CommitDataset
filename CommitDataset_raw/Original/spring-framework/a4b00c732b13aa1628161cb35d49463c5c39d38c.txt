Introduce BeanFactoryAnnotationUtils

Commit 096693c46fba6e09b346a498b7002abd4d6540a9 refactored and
deprecated TransactionAspectUtils, moving its #qualifiedBeanOfType
and related methods into BeanFactoryUtils. This created a package cycle
between beans.factory and beans.factory.annotation due to use of the
beans.factory.annotation.Qualifier annotation in these methods.

This commit breaks the package cycle by introducing
beans.factory.annotation.BeanFactoryAnnotationUtils and moving these
@Qualifier-related methods to it. It is intentionally similar in name
and style to the familiar BeanFactoryUtils class for purposes of
discoverability.

There are no backward-compatibilty concerns associated with this change
as the cycle was introduced, caught and now fixed before a release.
