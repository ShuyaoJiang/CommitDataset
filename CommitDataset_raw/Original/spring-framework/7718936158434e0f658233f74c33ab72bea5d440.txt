Recognize wildcards in media types with a suffix

The "includes" and "isCompatibleWith" methods of MediaType take into
account media types with suffices (e.g. application/soap+xml) including
wildcards with suffices (e.g. application/*+xml). However before this
change, the isWildcardSubtype() method returned true only for subtype
"*". Now a media type such as application/*+xml is also recognized as
having a wildcard subtype.
