Protect against '//' in UriComponentsBuilder

Refactor UriComponentsBuilder to ensure that paths do not contain empty
segments.

For example, prior to this commit:

    fromUriString("http://example.com/abc/").path("/x/y/z")

would build the URL "http://example.com/abc//x/y/z" where as it will
now build "http://example.com/abc/x/y/z".
