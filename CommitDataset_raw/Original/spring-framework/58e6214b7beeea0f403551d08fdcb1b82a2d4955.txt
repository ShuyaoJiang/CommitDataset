Support symbolic boolean operators for OR and AND

SpEL typically supports logical operators for boolean expressions
consistent with standard Java language syntax. However, the operators
for logical AND and logical OR are currently only supported as textual
operators. In other words, SpEL does not support the use of && and || as
logical operators.

The SpEL tokenizer has now been modified to recognize && and || as
symbolic boolean operators. The parser has been modified to allow the
use of either the textual or symbolic operators.
