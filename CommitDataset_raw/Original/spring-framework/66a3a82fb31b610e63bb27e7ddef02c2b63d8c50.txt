Avoid reference to HandlerMethod class in ServerErrorException

This breaks the package dependency cycle between web.server/web.method and makes ServerErrorException more generally applicable. Includes deprecation of the plain reason constructor variant, in favor of providing a Method or MethodParameter context (which MatrixVariableMethodArgumentResolver does now).
