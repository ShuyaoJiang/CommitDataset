Externalize javadoc-baseurl asciidoctor attribute

The `javadoc-baseurl` asciidoctor attribute is now externalized
(i.e. not included directly in the document anymore).

This allows to properly render javadoc links in single pages, whereas
those URLs were previoulsy only supported in the single page version.
