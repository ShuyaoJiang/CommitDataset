Add base contracts for the Web client

This commit adds the base contracts for the Web client.
The "Reactive" prefixes of the previously commited contracts has been
removed to match the server ones.

Both the `ClientHttpRequest` and the `ServerHttpResponse` extend
`ReactiveHttpOutputMessage`, which now has a `beforeCommit` method,
necessary in both client and server implementations.

`HttpRequestBuilder` will be used by the developers to create requests
with a nice builder API. `ClientHttpRequestFactory` will provide support
for many HTTP client libraries in this new client.
