Support 'required properties' precondition

Users may now call #setRequiredProperties(String...) against the
Environment (via its ConfigurablePropertyResolver interface) in order
to indicate which properties must be present.

Environment#validateRequiredProperties() is invoked by
AbstractApplicationContext during the refresh() lifecycle to perform
the actual check and a MissingRequiredPropertiesException is thrown
if the precondition is not satisfied.

Issue: SPR-8323
