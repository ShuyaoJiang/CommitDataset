Remove use of Boolean constructors

Codacy warns us that there are several references to Boolean
constructors in the tests. Direct usage of the Boolean constructor is
discouraged and even deprecated in Java 9 [1]. Boolean constructor use
can easily be replaced with the constant instances.

This commit contains the following changes:

 - replace references to Boolean constructors with boolean constants in
   JSP tag tests
 - update the copyright year where necessary
 - BooleanComparatorTests is intentionally left unchanged as it should
   also work with the non-constant instances correctly
