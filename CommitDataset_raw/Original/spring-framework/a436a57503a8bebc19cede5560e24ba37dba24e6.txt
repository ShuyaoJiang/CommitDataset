Move tests to spring-test module

When Spr9799XmlConfigTests and Spr9799AnnotationConfigTests were
created, there were issues with the classpath related to slf4j
dependencies that made it impossible for these classes to reside in the
spring-test module. Consequently, these tests were added to the
spring-test-mvc module. However, the issues with slf4j have since been
resolved in the Gradle build, and this commit therefore moves these test
classes to the spring-test module where they belong.

Issue: SPR-9799
