Use original query string of forwarded request

Prior to this commit, the AbstractFlashMapManager has used the
originating URI but the query string of the forwarded request. That
resulted to FlashMap not being matched even when both originating
URI and query string matched the FlashMap attributes. The originating
query string is now used to match the forwarded request.
