Introduce RequestEntity and builder

This commit introduces the RequestEntity, a class similar to
ResponseEntity, but meant for HTTP requests rather than responses. The
RequestEntity can be used both in RestTemplate as well as @MVC
scenarios.

The class also comes with a builder, similar to the one found in
ResponseEntity, which allows for building of a RequestEntity through a
fluent API.
