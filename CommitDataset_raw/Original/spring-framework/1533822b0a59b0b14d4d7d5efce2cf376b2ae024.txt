Update proxyTargetClass-related Javadoc; add tests

There was some question about whether enabling subclass proxies via
proxyTargetClass / proxy-target-class settings would break annotation-
based demarcation of joinpoints due to inability to discover those
annotations in various scenarios. The provided tests prove that in
any conceivable case, these annotations (@Transactional, at least)
are discovered in a consistent fashion, meaning that switching proxy
strategies should be transparent to the application and honor
intended annotation semantics.
