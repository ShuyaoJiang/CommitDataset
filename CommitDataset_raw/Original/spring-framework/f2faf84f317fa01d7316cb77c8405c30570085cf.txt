Add RFC5987 support for HTTP header field params

This commit adds support for HTTP header field parameters encoding, as
described in RFC5987.
Note that the default implementation still relies on US-ASCII encoding,
as the latest rfc7230 Section 3.2.4 says that:

> Newly defined header fields SHOULD limit their field values to
  US-ASCII octets

Issue: SPR-14547
