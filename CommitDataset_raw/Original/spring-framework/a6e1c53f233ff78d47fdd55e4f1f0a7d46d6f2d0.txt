Update default SockJS CDN location

This commit updates the default location of the SockJS' client library.
The previous location is being retired by the project maintainers.

The new default location is backed by several CDN providers:
* https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/sockjs/0.3.4/sockjs.min.js

See sockjs/sockjs-client#198
