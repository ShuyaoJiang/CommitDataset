Revert "Introduce (Annotation)SessionFactoryBuilder types"

This commit and the several before it back out the
SessionFactoryBuilder and AnnotationSessionFactoryBuilder types
recently introduced in 3.1 M2. This is in light of the impending
release of Hibernate 4.0 GA and our own support for it the new
org.springframework.orm.hibernate4 package (not yet committed).

This new package will have a similar, but far simpler, arrangement of
a single LocalSessionFactoryBuilder and LocalSessionFactoryBean pair.
Hibernate 3.x support will remain largely as-is, however the
HibernateTransactionManager introduced with SPR-8076 will remain.

This reverts commit 9e8259198f07e495fd32359c0e0c197bb79a2ca0.
