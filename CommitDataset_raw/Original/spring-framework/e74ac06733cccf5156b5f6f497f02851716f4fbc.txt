Filter WebSocket extensions

Before this change the DefaultHandshakeHandler by default passed the
list of requested WebSocket extensions as-is relying on the WebSocket
engine to remove those not supported.

This change ensures that WebSocket extensions not supported by the
runtime are proactively removed instead.

This change is preparation for SPR-11094.
