Pull WebFlux getMappingPathPatterns() implementation up in the hierarchy

This commit moves the WebFlux getMappingPathPatterns() implementation
from RequestMappingHandlerMapping to
RequestMappingInfoHandlerMapping so that subclasses of the latter no
longer need to re-implement the method.

See gh-22543
