Ensure that contexts loaded by the TCF are active

This commit adds an assertion to DefaultTestContext's
getApplicationContext() method to ensure that a context loaded by the
Spring TestContext Framework (TCF) or retrieved from the ContextCache
is still active. This extra check helps to avoid situations where
developers manually close a cached context instead of relying on the
@DirtiesContext support.

Issue: SPR-12932
