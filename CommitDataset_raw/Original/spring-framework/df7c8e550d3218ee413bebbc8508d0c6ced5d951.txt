Updates to WebHandler support

Rename two classes each adapting to WebHandler to avoid confusing them:
1. HttpWebHandlerAdapter adapts from the low level HttpHandler to any
WebHandler (e.g. DispatcherHandler).
2. SimpleHandlerAdapter adapts the plain WebHandler for use within the
DispatcherHandler.

This commit also fixes an issue in WebHttpHandlerBuilder to ensure that
WebExceptionHandler's are inserted before and not after WebFilter's.
