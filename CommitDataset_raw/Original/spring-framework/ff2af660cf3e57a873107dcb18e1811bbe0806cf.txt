PathPatternParser encodes patterns as it parses them

Before this commit there was no special handling for URL encoding
of the path pattern string coming into the path pattern parser. No
assumptions were made about it being in an encoded form or not.

With this change it is assumed incoming path patterns are not
encoded and as part of parsing the parser builds PathPattern
objects that include encoded elements. For example parsing "/f o"
will create a path pattern of the form "/f%20o". In this form
it can then be used to match against encoded paths.

Handling encoded characters is not trivial and has resulted in
some loss in matching speed but care has been taken to
avoid unnecessary creation of additional heap objects.  When
matching variables the variable values are return in a
decoded form. It is hoped the speed can be recovered, at least
for the common case of non-encoded incoming paths.
