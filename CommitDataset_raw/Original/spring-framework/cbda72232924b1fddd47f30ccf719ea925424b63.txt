HibernateJpaDialect prepares JDBC Connection by default if on Hibernate EntityManager 4 (with its connection release mode ON_CLOSE)

Analogous to HibernateTransactionManager, there is a "prepareConnection" flag on HibernateJpaDialect which allows for overriding the actual mode of operation. This is easily accessible from HibernateJpaVendorAdapter now which declares HibernateJpaDialect from its getJpaDialect() method.
