Avoid duplicate Etag/Last-Modified header values

This commit improves SPR-13090 and avoids adding duplicate ETag and
Last-Modified headers in HTTP responses.
Previously, those were added twice to the response since:

* we're adding all ResponseEntity headers to the response
* the `checkNotModified` methods automatically add those headers

Issue: SPR-13090
