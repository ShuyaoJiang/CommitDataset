Better support for @SessionAttributes in clustered environments

A list of "known" session attributes (listed in @SessionAttributes)
was gradually built as attributes get added to the model. In a
failover scenario that knowledge is lost causing session attributes
to be potentially re-initialized via @ModelAttribute methods.

With this change @SessionAttributes listed by name are immediately
added to he list of "known" session attributes thus this knowledge
is not lost after a failover. Attributes listed by type however
still must be discovered as they get added to the model.
