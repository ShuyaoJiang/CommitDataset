Map ORA-30006 to CannotAcquireLockException as well

ORA-00054 is already mapped to CannotAcquireLockException and is
described as

  "resource busy and acquire with NOWAIT specified"

As pointed out in the associated JIRA issue, ORA-30006 is quite similar
being described as

  "resource busy; acquire with WAIT timeout expired"

This commit maps ORA-30006 to CannotAcquireLockException as well.

Issue: SPR-9141
