Introduce AnnotationConfigCapableApplicationContext

AnnotationConfigApplicationContext and
AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext both expose #register and #scan
methods as of the completion of SPR-8320. This change introduces a new
interface that declares each of these methods and refactors ACAC and
ACWAC to implement it.

Beyond information value, this is useful for implementors of the
ApplicationContextInitializer interface, in that users may create an ACI
that works consistently across ACAC and ACWAC for standalone (e.g.
testing, batch) or web (e.g. production) use.

Issue: SPR-8365,SPR-8320
