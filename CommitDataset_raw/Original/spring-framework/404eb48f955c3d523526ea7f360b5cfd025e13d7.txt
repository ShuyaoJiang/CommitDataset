Clean up spring-jms tests warnings

Clean up compiler warnings in the tests of spring-jms. This commit
adds type parameters to all the types (mostly `List` and `Map`).

I am not too sure about the `Map` type parameters in
`MessageContentsDelegate` and `ResponsiveMessageDelegate` however the
respective methods seem unused.
