Fix issue in TomcatRequestUpgradeStrategy

The method WsServerContainer.getServerContainer() was removed from
JSR-356 but remained in Tomcat a little while longer. Instead the
ServerContainer is obtained through a ServletContext attribute.
Tomcat has now removed this method, hence the need for this fix.
