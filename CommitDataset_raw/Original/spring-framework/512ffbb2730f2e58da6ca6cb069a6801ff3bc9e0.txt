Update PortletRequestUtilsTests float test timeout

Float parameter handling appears to be marginally more expensive under
JDK7, with the testGetFloatParameterWithDefaultValueHandlingIsFastEnough
test clocking in anywhere from 250 to 315 ms. This violates the current
test threshold of 250 ms, so this commit ups the timeout value to 350 ms
with the assumption that this is indeed a marginal and therefore overall
negligible performance degradation.
