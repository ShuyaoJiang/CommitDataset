Polish serialization/deserialization exception logging

This commit introduces the following changes in AbstractHandlerExceptionResolver:
 - warnLogger used to log exception is enabled by default
 - the exception message is now logged instead of the whole exception stacktrace
 - warn logging is only performed if doResolveException() returns a non-null
   ModelAndView, in order to avoid logging multiple times the error

Issue: SPR-13100
