Access to request and response byte[] in WebTestClient

The WiretapConnector now decorated the ClientHttpRequest & Response
in order to intercept and save the actual content written and read.

The saved content is now incorporated in the diagnostic output but may
be used for other purposes as well (e.g. REST Docs).

Diagnostic information about an exchange has also been refactored
similar to command line output from curl.
