Allow defining default content negotiation strategy

During the HTTP Content Negotiation phase, the ContentNegotiationManager
uses configured ContentNegotiationStrategy(ies) to define the list of
content types accepted by the client.

When HTTP clients don't send Accept headers, nor use a configured
file extension in the request, nor a request param, developers can
define a default content type using the
ContentNegotiationConfigurer.defaultContentType() method.

This change adds a new overloaded defaultContentType method that takes a
ContentNegotiationStrategy as an argument. This strategy will take the
current request as an argument and return a default content type.
