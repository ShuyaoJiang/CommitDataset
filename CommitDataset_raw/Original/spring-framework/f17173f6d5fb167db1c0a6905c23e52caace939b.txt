Synthesize nested maps into annotations

Prior to this commit, attempting to synthesize an annotation from a map
of annotation attributes that contained nested maps instead of nested
annotations would result in an exception.

This commit addresses this issue by properly synthesizing nested maps
and nested arrays of maps into nested annotations and nested arrays of
annotations, respectively.

Issue: SPR-13338
