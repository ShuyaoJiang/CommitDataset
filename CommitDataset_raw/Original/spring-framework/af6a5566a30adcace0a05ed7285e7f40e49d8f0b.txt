Replace context by provider<T>() in Kotlin bean DSL

Spring Framework 5.1.0 exposed by mistake context in the Kotlin bean DSL
API in order to fix SPR-16269. Now that BeanFactory#getBeanprovider is
available, it should be exposed via a provider<Foo>() function in order
to provide a more clean API instead.

Issue: SPR-17352
