Fix regression with binding and validation

Previously, the binding may have to call the getter first to retrieve the
old value of a property before actually setting it. This was guarded by
a catch block that was accidentally removed in 3d86f15

Restore that catch block and add a test to cover it.

Issue: SPR-12805
