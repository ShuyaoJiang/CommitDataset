Introduce new HEARTBEAT message type

Previously, there was no generic concept of a message that represents
a heartbeat and the STOMP-specific code used a null STOMP command to
represent a heartbeat.

This commit introduces HEARTBEAT as a new SimpMessageType. The STOMP
support has been updated to create HEARTBEAT messages to represent
heartbeats, and to use the new message type as the mechanism by which
heartbeats are identified.
