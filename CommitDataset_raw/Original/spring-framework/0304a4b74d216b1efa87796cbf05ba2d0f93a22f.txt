Revert "Introduce Ordered#NOT_ORDERED"

This reverts commit da914bcfb4599ebf746ea477c691ed99c4842ed0 and also
removes the use of Ordered#NOT_ORDERED from EnableTransactionManagement
and ProxyTransactionManagementConfiguration in favor of defaulting to
Ordered#LOWEST_PRIORITY, which is actually the default that results
when no 'order' attribute is specified in XML.
