Support nested meta-annotations in AnnotationUtils

Prior to this commit, AnnotationUtils.findAnnotation(Class, Class)
claimed to recursively search through annotations; however, only one
level of annotations was supported by the algorithm.

This commit alters the search algorithm so that nested meta-annotations
(i.e., meta-annotations on meta-annotations) are also supported.

Issue: SPR-11448
