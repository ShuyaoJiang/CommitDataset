merge-dist.gradle disables artifactoryPublish

Previously the project that was getting merged from would try to
execute the artifactoryPublish on the build box. This caused issues
since the mavenDescriptor did not exist.

The merge-dist.gradle now disables the artifactoryPublish task if it
exists (it will only exist on the build box).

Issue: SPR-9859, SPR-7951
