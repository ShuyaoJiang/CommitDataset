Improve async request timeout handling

Rather than setting the status to 503 directly from the timeout
interceptor which no longer seems to work reliably with Servlet
containers like Jetty even performing an additional ERROR dispatch back
to the original URL, we know rather set the DeferredResult to an
AsyncTimeoutException, which results in a dispatch and standard
handling within Spring MVC. This should be a more reliable way of
dealing with timeouts.
