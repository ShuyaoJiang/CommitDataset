Recursively process DeferredImportSelector properly

Previously, if a DeferredImportSelector was identified at a later stage
as part of processing the collected set of deferred imports, such
selector was processed as a regular import selector.

Semantically, it makes sense as we already are in the deferred phase at
this point and it doesn't make much sense to bother about the extra
contract.

However, Spring Framework 5 introduced the notion of Group that a
deferred import selector can define. When it does, the container has to
honour the contract of the Group rather than calling the simpler
ImportSelector parent contract.

This commit restructures the processing of such case. When a deferred
import selector is detected while processing deferred import selectors,
a group is created with only that selector and the group API is invoked.

Issue: SPR-17351
