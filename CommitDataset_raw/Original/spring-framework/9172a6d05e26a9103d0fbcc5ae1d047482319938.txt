Restore proper use of CacheLoader

Since Guava 11, CacheLoader is only invoked with a LoadingCache but the
GuavaCache wrapper is always invoking getIfPresent(), available on the
main Guava Cache interface.

Update GuavaCache#get to check for the presence of a LoadingCache and
call the appropriate method.
