Tighten up exception handling strategy

WebSocketHandler implementations:
- methods must deal with exceptions locally
- uncaught runtime exceptions are handled by ending the session
- transport errors (websocket engine) are passed into handleError

WebSocketSession methods may raise IOException

SockJS implementation of WebSocketHandler:
- delegate SockJS transport errors into handleError
- stop runtime exceptions from user WebSocketHandler and end session

SockJsServce and TransportHandlers:
- raise IOException or TransportErrorException

HandshakeHandler:
- raise IOException
