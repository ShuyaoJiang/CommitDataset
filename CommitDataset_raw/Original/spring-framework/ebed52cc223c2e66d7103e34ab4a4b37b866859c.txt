Favor local, composed annotations in AnnotatedElementUtils

This commit updates the "get semantics" search algorithm used in
`AnnotatedElementUtils` so that locally declared 'composed annotations'
are favored over inherited annotations.

Specifically, the internal `searchWithGetSemantics()` method now
searches locally declared annotations before searching inherited
annotations.

All TODOs in `AnnotatedElementUtilsTests` have been completed, and all
ignored tests have been reinstated.

Issue: SPR-11598
