Remove duplicate test resources

The files deleted in this commit existed in identical form in two places
within a given module; typically in src/test/java and
src/test/resources. The version within src/test/resources has been
favored in all cases.

This change was prompted by associated Eclipse warnings, which have now
been quelled.
