Fix race condition in transition from UNSUBSCRIBED->COMPLETED

- Ensure completion signal (normal/exception) will be delivered to
the subscriber when transition from UNSUBSCRIBED->COMPLETED

- According to the specification "Publisher.subscribe MUST call onSubscribe
on the provided Subscriber prior to any other signals to that Subscriber" so
ensure onComplete/onError signals will be called AFTER onSubscribe signal.
