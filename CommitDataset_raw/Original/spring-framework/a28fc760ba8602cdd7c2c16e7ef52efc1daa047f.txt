Fix SpEL compilation of static method/property/field operations

Before this change the compilation of a method reference or property/field
access was not properly cleaning up the stack if compilation meant
calling a static method or accessing a static field. In these cases there
is no need for a target object on the stack and it should be removed if
present. For a simple expression it is harmless since the end result of
the expression is the thing on the top of the stack, but for nested
expressions if the inner expression suffered this issue, the outer
expression can find itself operating on the wrong element.

The particular issue covered the case of a static field access but this
fix (and associated tests) cover static method, property and field access.

Issue: SPR-13781
