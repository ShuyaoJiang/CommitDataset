Minor refactoring in StringDecoder + polish

1. Avoid re-creating the List with delimited byte arrays on every
request if using the default delimiters which don't vary by charset.

2. Replace flatMap with flatMapIterable for splitOnDelimiter.

3. Avoid going through DataBufferUtils#join, and unnecessarily creating
Flux from the List, since the join method needs a list anyway.
