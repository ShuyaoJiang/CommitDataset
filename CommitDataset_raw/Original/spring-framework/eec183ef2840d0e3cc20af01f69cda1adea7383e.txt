Ensure spring-test test tasks are UP-TO-DATE

Prior to this commit, the three `test` tasks in the spring-test module
shared the same output directory for test reports. This had the
negative side effect of causing Gradle to believe that the tasks were
not UP-TO-DATE. Consequently, all three `test` tasks in the spring-test
module were executed for every build even if there were zero changes in
the spring-test module.

This commit fixes this issue by allowing Gradle to use the default test
results output directory for each `test` task. Thanks to @marcphilipp
for providing the tip.

In addition, the Artifactory Gradle task in the Default Job of the
Bamboo build plan for the Spring Framework (SPR-PUB) has been updated
to use the following custom test results directory pattern:
`**/build/test-results/**/*.xml`.
