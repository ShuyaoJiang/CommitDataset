Allow treating empty @RequestParam as missing value

If type conversion turns an empty request parameter value (i.e. "") to
null, we should treat it as a missing value. By default the
ConversionService doesn't change empty strings and therefore one must
explicitly convert them to null for example by registering a
StringTrimmerEditor with emptyAsNull=true.
