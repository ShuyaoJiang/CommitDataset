PathResourceResolver should not resolve root path

When resolving resources, the PathResourceResolver creates a Resource
instance and checks whether this resource `exists()` and `isReadable()`.
While that last call returns false for folders on the file system, both
calls return true for folders located inside JARs.

If a JAR location is configured as a resource location, then
PathResourceResolver can resolve folders in JARs as valid locations and
candidates for paths resolution.

Prior to this change, the PathResourceResolver would resolve "" as a
valid resource path (here, the "/META-INF/resources/webjars" if
configured, for example) and return a "" path for this resource,
effectively turning all "/" URLs into empty ones "".

This commit fixes the resolveUrlPathInternal implementation by not
allowing empty paths as valid resource paths.
