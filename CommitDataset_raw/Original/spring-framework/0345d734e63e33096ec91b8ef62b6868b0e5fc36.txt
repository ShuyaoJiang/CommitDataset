Improve exception logging in HandlerExceptionResolvers

This commit updates AbstractHandlerExceptionResolver to only log at the
WARN level exceptions that are actually resolved by the
ExceptionResolver.

In case developers wish to log each time an ExceptionResolver is called,
a DEBUG level log is still available.

Issue: SPR-14392
