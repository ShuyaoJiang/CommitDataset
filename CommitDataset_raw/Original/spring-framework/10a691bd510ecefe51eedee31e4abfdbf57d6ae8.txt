Support inlined SQL statements in @Sql

Prior to this commit, it was only possible to declare SQL statements
via @Sql within external script resources (i.e., classpath or file
system resources); however, many developers have inquired about the
ability to inline SQL statements with @Sql analogous to the support for
inlined properties in @TestPropertySource.

This commit introduces support for declaring _inlined SQL statements_
in `@Sql` via a new `statements` attribute. Inlined statements are
executed after statements in scripts.

Issue: SPR-13159
