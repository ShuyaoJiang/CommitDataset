Simplify use of headers for SockJsClient requests

Before this change, XhrTransport implementations had to be configured
with the headers to use for HTTP requests other than the initial
handshake.

After this change the handshake headers passed to SockJsClient by
default are used for all other HTTP requests related to the SockJS
connection (e.g. info request, xhr send/receive). A property on
SockJsClient allows restricting the headers to use for other HTTP
requests to a subset of the handshake headers.
