BeanWrapper auto-grows arrays if necessary

Previously, only indexed access for collections were supported. When
attempting to access the element of an array that had not the requested
size, the call would fail with an IndexOutOfBoundException

This commit harmonize the binding support so that the array is updated
according to the requested index if necessary.
