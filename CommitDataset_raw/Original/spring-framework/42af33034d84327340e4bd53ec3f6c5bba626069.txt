Make TestPropertySourceUtils more robust

 - Added assertions for pre-conditions on method arguments for all
   public utility methods.

 - Introduced additional tests in TestPropertySourceUtilsTests to verify
   the new pre-conditions.

 - Introduced INLINED_PROPERTIES_PROPERTY_SOURCE_NAME constant for the
   name of the MapPropertySource created from inlined properties; the
   name therefore no longer contains the inlined properties, but the
   original values of the inlined properties can now be logged at debug
   level.

 - Simplified tests in InlinedPropertiesTestPropertySourceTests.
