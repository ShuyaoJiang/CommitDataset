Sort handler matches in ResourceUrlProvider

Prior to this change, the `ResourceUrlProvider.getForLookupPath` method
would try to match handlers using the keySet order in the
handlerMappings Map. In case of several matches, the handler used for
the return value could vary, since the registration order in the
handlerMappings can't be guaranteed in the configuration.

This commit now collects all matching handlers and sort them using a
`PatternComparator`, in order to try each handler from the most specific
mapping to the least.
