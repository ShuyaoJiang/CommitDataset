Trim expressions supplied to @DisabledIf

Prior to this commit, the DisabledIfCondition did not trim whitespace
from expressions configured via @DisabledIf. Consequently, results such
as "  true  " would evaluate to "false".

This commit fixes this problem by trimming all expressions configured
via @DisabledIf.
