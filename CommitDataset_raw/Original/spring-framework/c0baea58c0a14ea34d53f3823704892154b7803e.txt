Fix issue with generic @RequestBody arguments

The original commit c9b7b1 ensured the ability to read parameterized
type @RequestBody arguments via GenericHttpMessageConverter (e.g.
application/json and List<String>). However, it also affected the
ability to read @RequestBody arguments that happen are parameterized
but aren't treated as such (e.g. application/x-www-form-urlencoded and
MultiValueMap<String, String>). This commit corrects the issue.

Issue: SPR-9570
