Lazy resolution of the JMS message

Previously, any `javax.jms.Message` was converted eagerly to the Message
abstraction. This leads to unnecessary conversion if the Payload is not
requested by the underlying method (i.e. if the `javax.jms.Message` is
injected directly).

This commit returns a `Message` implementation that holds the
`javax.jms.Message` and lazily resolve the payload or the headers on
demand (that is the first time they are requested).

Issue: SPR-13777
