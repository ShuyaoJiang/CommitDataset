Update test source and target JDK compatibility

"test" source and target compatibility has been upgraded to 1.7 except
where noted, allowing us to use 1.7 language features such as
diamond-style (<>) generics declarations, automatic resource management
and multi-catch. More importantly, we will be able to upgrade to 1.8
once it is available in order to make use of lambda expressions, etc in
our test cases.

IDE configurations must be relaxed to allow 1.7 across the board, as
neither Eclipse nor IDEA are clever enough to allow for different
language levels across production and test resources. See [1] for a
feature request on that front.

spring-oxm is a special case here, and has been pinned at 1.6
compatibility even for its test sources in order to avoid a class
verification error that JibX throws when encountering 1.7-level
bytecode [2].

Likewise with spring-orm, toplink encounters a similar class
verification error, so has been pinned to 1.6 for the time being.
When we remove the (already deprecated since 3.2) Toplink support
we can restore compatibility to 1.7.
