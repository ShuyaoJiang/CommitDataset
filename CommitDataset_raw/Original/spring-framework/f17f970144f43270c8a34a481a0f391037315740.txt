Allow other delimiters in profile XML attribute

Previously, only commas could delimit <beans profile="p1,p2"/>.  Now, as
with <bean alias="..."/>, the profile attribute allows for delimiting
by comma, space and/or semicolon.

BeanDefinitionParserDelegate.MULTI_VALUE_ATTRIBUTE_DELIMITERS has been
added as a constant to reflect the fact this set of delimiters is used
in multiple locations throughout the framework.
BDPD.BEAN_NAME_DELIMITERS now refers to the above and has been has been
preserved but deprecated for backward compat (though use outside the
framework is unlikely).
