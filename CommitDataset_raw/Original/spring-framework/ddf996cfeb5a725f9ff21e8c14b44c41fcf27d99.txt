Polish HttpRequestBuilder API

This commit makes messageEncoders a required argument for building a
client request - those are needed to actually encode the body object as
a reactive stream to be written to the HTTP request body.

Removed raw types usage in DefaultHttpRequestBuilder.

DefaultHttpRequestBuilder now uses a UriTemplateHandler to expand URI
templates + variables into a concrete URI.

Fixes #80, fixes #85, fixes #86
