Include javax.jdo 3.x in spring-orm template.mf

Prior to this change, spring-orm/template.mf was exclusive of javax.jdo
3.0.0. Now, after local testing against the newly-released jdo-api 3.0
jar, the template has been updated to allow for use in OSGi containers.
Note that actually updating build dependency descriptors to JDO 3.0 such
that the framework is continually tested against this version is covered
by a separate issue (SPR-8668).

Issue: SPR-8667, SPR-8655
