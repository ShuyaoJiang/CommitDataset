Add public variant getDeclaredMethods method

Add a public variant of `getDeclaredMethods` that defensively copies the
cached methods array. This is often more faster and more convenient
for users than calling `doWithLocalMethods`. We still retain most of the
benefits of the cache, namely fewer security manager calls and not as
many `Method` instances being created.
