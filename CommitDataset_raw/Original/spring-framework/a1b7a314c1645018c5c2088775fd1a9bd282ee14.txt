Add BindException to DefaultHandlerExceptionResolver

Previously DefaultHandlerExceptionResolver did not handle BindException
but after this change it does. A BindException is raised when an
@ModelAttribute annotated argument is not followed by a BindingResult
argument. Hence this is unlikely to affect browser rendering.
For programmatic clients however this change ensures an unhandled
BindException is at least turned into a 400 error.
