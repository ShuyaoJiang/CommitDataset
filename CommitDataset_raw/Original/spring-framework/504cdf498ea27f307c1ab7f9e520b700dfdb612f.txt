Update documentation of 'annotated class' support in the TCF

Updated the testing chapter of the reference manual to refer to 
'annotated classes' instead of 'configuration classes' where 
appropriate.

Also revised the content and examples in the @ContextConfiguration 
annotation section, mentioned Gradle, and reformatted the entire text.
