Fix transitive dependency issue with slf4j-api

Before this change, IDE settings generated via import-into-eclipse.sh
created a classpath dependency on slf4j-api version 1.6.1 and
slf4j-log4j12 version 1.5.10. As a result running tests inside the IDE
resulted in a NoSuchMethodException.

build.gradle sets the variable slf4jLog4jVersion to '1.5.10'. However,
the hibernate-validator dependency in spring-context pulls in
slf4j-api version 1.6.1. The change ensures the version specified in
the build script variable is used consistently. Whether it should be
1.5.10 or 1.6.1 is a separate concern.
