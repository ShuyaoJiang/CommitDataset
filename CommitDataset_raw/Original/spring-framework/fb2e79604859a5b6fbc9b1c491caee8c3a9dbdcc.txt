HandlerResult now requires MethodParameter as input

HandlerAdapter's should always be able to provide a MethodParameter
which in turn ensures that HandlerResultHandler's have full type
information from method declarations.

This commit also introduces ResolvableMethod for use in tests to make
it easy to obtain MethodParameter return types.

Issue: #128
