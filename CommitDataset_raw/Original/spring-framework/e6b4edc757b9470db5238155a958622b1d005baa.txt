Simplify access to response body in WebClient

This commit makes a change to WebClient in oder to facilitate getting
the response body as a `Mono<Object>` or `Flux<Object>` without having
to deal with `ClientResponse`.

Specifically, this commit:

 - Adds `RequestHeaderSpec.retrieve` methods, next to `exchange`, that
 return the response body (and not a `ClientResponse`). Two convenience
 methods return the response body as `Mono` or `Flux`.
 - Adds ClientResponse.toRequestEntity to convert the ClientResponse
 into a RequestEntity.
