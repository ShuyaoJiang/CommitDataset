Include **/*.aj files in *-sources.jar files

Previously only **/*.java sources files were included in the sources
jars. This is not ideal for the spring-aspects jar nor does it match
prior versions of the sources jars.

Now **/*.aj files are included in addition to the **/*.java files.

Issue: SPR-9576
