ClassUtils.getMostSpecificMethod uses Class.getMethod code path in case of a public method

This should be significantly faster than our standard algorithm, for a very common case. Motivated by SPR-9802, even if the fix there uses a different approach, with transaction name determination not calling getMostSpecificMethod at all anymore.

Issue: SPR-9802
