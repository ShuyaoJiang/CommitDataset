Avoid duplicate registration of [RequestBody|ResponseBody]Advice @ControllerAdvice

Prior to this commit, if a @ControllerAdvice implemented both
RequestBodyAdvice and ResponseBodyAdvice, it was registered twice in
RequestMappingHandlerAdapter.

This commit ensures that such instances are only registered once.

Closes gh-22638
