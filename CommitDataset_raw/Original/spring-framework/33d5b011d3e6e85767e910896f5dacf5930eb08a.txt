Reduce code duplication in ContextLoaderUtils

Prior to this commit, the following two methods in ContextLoaderUtils
contained almost identical loops for traversing the test class
hierarchy:

 - resolveContextLoaderClass(Class<?>, String)
 - resolveContextConfigurationAttributes(Class<?>)

With this commit, resolveContextLoaderClass() no longer traverses the
class hierarchy. Instead, it now works directly with the resolved list
of ContextConfigurationAttributes, thereby removing code duplication.
