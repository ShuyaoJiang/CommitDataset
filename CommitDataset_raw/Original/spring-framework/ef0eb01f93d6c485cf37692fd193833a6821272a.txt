Fix backwards compatibility in WebContentInterceptor

As of SPR-11792, WebContentGenerator and WebContentInterceptor offer
new APIs and new behavior regarding HTTP caching, including the use of a
new CacheControl class.

Those changes broke part of the behavior in WebContentInterceptor. This
class allows to override the global Cache configuration at the Generator
level, using specific mappings. Prior to this change, those mappings
would not properly apply the HTTP caching configuration when using
deprecated configuration settings in WebContentGenerator.

This change fixes those backwards compatibility issues for
WebContentInterceptor users.

Issue: SPR-13207
