Introduced HibernateTemplate for Hibernate 4 as a migration helper

Note that this variant of HibernateTemplate is stripped down in terms of Session management options and just provides a current-session style with a fallback to a temporary session-per-operation.  Furthermore, in the latter fallback mode, only read operations are supported, just like with a JPA EntityManager.

Issue: SPR-11291
