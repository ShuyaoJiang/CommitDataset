Drain JDK HTTP client response body in all cases

Prior to this commit, when using the `SimpleClientHttpRequestFactory`
as a driver for `RestTemplate`, the HTTP response body would only be
drained if there was an attempt to read it in the first place.

This commit ensures that, even if there's no attempt at reading the
response body, it is properly drained when the response is closed to
make sure that the connection is released in a proper state and can be
put back in the connection pool for reuse.
