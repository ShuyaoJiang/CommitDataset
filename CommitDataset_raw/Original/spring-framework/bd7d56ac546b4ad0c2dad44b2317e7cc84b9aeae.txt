Fix VerifyError for SpEL ternary compilation

The ternary expression node was failing to generate the
necessary unboxing bytecode when the condition part
of the expression returned a boxed Boolean rather than
a primitive boolean.

Also fixed here is an IllegalAccessError that was
seen in the same expression due to generating a
CHECKCAST bytecode for a private type.
