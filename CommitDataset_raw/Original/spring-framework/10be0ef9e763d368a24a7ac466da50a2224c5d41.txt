Clarify BeanFactory#containsBean Javadoc

Previously, #containsBean Javadoc advertised that a true return value
indicates that a call to #getBean for the same name would succeed.

This is actually not the case, and has never been.  The semantics
of #containsBean have always been to indicate whether a bean definition
with the given name is definied or a singleton instance with the given
name has been registered.

The Javadoc now reflects this accurately.
