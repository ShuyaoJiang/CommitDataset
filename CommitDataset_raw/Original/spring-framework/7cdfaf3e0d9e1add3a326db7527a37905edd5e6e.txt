Convert SpEL plus operands using reg'd converters

Prior to this commit, SpEL's OpPlus ('+' operator) would convert its
left and right operands to String directly via #toString calls.

This change ensures that operand values are delegated to any registered
converters, allowing for customization of the stringified output.

Note that the OpPlus constructor now throws IllegalArgumentException if
zero operands are supplied.

Issue: SPR-8308
