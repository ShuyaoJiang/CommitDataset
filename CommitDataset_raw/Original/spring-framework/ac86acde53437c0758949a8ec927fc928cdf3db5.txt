ReactiveAdapterRegistry detects Reactor

The ReactiveAdapterRegistry now detects the presence of Reactor. In
practice Reactor is required for the Spring Framework reactive support
and it is expected to be present.

The registry however is now capable of being neutral if Reactor is not
present on the classpath for example where other Spring projects may
not have the same assumptions about Reactor's presence.
