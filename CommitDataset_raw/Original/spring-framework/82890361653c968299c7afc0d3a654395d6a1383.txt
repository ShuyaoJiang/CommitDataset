Throw exception if required meta-annotation is not present

It is a configuration error if an alias is declared via @AliasFor for
an attribute in a meta-annotation and the meta-annotation is not
meta-present. However, prior to this commit, the support for validating
the configuration of @AliasFor in AnnotationUtils currently silently
ignored such errors.

This commit fixes this by throwing an AnnotationConfigurationException
whenever a required meta-annotation is not present or meta-present on
an annotation that declares an explicit alias for an attribute in the
meta-annotation.

Issue: SPR-13335
