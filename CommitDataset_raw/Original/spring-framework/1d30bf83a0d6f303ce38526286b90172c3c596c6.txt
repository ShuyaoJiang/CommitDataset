Favor 'local' annotations over inherited ones

Prior to this commit, the implementations of findAnnotation() in
AnnotationUtils and getAnnotationAttributes() in AnnotatedElementUtils
favored inherited annotations and inherited composed annotations over
composed annotations that are declared closer to the starting class
passed to these methods.

This commit addresses this issue as follows:

- Refactored AnnotationUtils to use getDeclaredAnnotation() and
  getDeclaredAnnotations() instead of getAnnotation() and
  getAnnotations() where appropriate.

- AnnotatedElementUtils.doProcess() supports a traverseClassHierarchy
  flag to control whether the class hierarchy should be traversed,
  using getDeclaredAnnotations() instead of getAnnotations() if the
  flag is true.

- Overhauled Javadoc in AnnotatedElementUtils.

Issue: SPR-11475
