Introduce ForwardedHeaderFilter for WebFlux

This commit introduces a ForwardedHeaderFilter for WebFlux, similar to
the existing Servlet version. As part of this the
DefaultServerHttpRequestBuilder had to be changed to no longer use
delegation, but instead use a deep copy at the point of mutate().
Otherwise, headers could not be removed.
