Re-enable Hibernate EntityManagerFactory tests

HibernateEntityManagerFactoryIntegrationTests in the spring-orm module
has been disabled for quite some time due to a dependency on the
AnnotationBeanConfigurerAspect from the spring-aspects module. Since
spring-aspects depends on spring-orm, a cyclical dependency would
result if this code were re-enabled "as is".

This commit removes the dependency on AnnotationBeanConfigurerAspect in
HibernateEntityManagerFactoryIntegrationTests by deleting all test code
and configuration related to @Configurable. In addition, this commit
also deletes all SessionFactory-specific test code in
HibernateEntityManagerFactoryIntegrationTests, allowing the test class
to focus on Hibernate as a JPA provider.

Issue: SPR-11922
