Translate SQLTimeoutException to QueryTimeoutException

SPR-7680 added QueryTimeoutException to Spring's DataAccessException
hierarchy, but did not integrate it into the
SQLExceptionSubclassTranslator; it was added mainly to accomodate users
defining their own custom exception translators.

However, it does make sense to translate any SQLTimeoutException to this
new QueryTimeoutException type, and this commit makes that change. It
does represent a slight backward-incompatibility, given that
QueryTimeoutException extends TransientDataAccessException, whereas
SQLExceptionSubclassTranslator previously returned the more specific
TransientDataAccessResourceException for any SQLTimeoutException.

It is expected that this incompatibily will be very low-impact, i.e. not
affecting many (if any) users. In any case, a major release (Spring 3.2)
is the right time to introduce such a change, and the migration path is
straightforward: any users depending on catching
TransientDataAccessResourceException in the case of query timeouts
should update those catch blocks to expect QueryTimeoutException
instead. Care should also be taken to ensure correctness of existing
catch blocks expecting TransientDataAccessException, as these blocks
will now catch QueryTimeoutException as well.
