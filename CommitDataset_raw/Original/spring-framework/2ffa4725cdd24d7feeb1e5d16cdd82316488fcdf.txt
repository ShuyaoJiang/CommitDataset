Allow SELECT statements in ResourceDatabasePopulator

ResourceDatabasePopulator is a component that underlies the database
initialization support within Spring's jdbc: namespace, e.g.:

    <jdbc:initialize-database data-source="dataSource">
        <jdbc:script execution="INIT" location="classpath:init.sql"/>
    </jdbc:initialize-database>

Prior to this commit, ResourceDatabasePopulator#executeSqlScript's use
of Statement#executeUpdate(sql) precluded the possibility of SELECT
statements because returning a result is not permitted by this method
and results in an exception being thrown.

Whether this behavior is a function of the JDBC specification or an
idiosyncracy of certain implementations does not matter as the issue
can be worked around entirely. This commit eliminates use
of #executeUpdate(sql) in favor of #execute(sql) followed by a call
to #getUpdateCount, effectively allowing any kind of SQL statement to
be executed during database initialization.

Issue: SPR-8932
