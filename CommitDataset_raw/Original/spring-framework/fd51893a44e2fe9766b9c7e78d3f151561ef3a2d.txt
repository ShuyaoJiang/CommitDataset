Refactor exchange mutator

As a follow-up to the recent commit 246e72 some slight modifications
to MockServerExchangeMutator (renamed to ExchnageMutatorWebFilter).

Aside from the name change, the main difference is that "per request"
exchange processors are now simply applied via WebTestClient#filter(..).

Issue: SPR-15570
