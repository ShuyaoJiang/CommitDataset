Add ability to customize message channels

@EnableWebSocketMessageBroker message channel configuration can now be
customized via WebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer. It is necessary to
make this easy and even required as part of the basic configuration
since by default the message channels are backed by a thread pool of
size 1, not suitable for production use.
