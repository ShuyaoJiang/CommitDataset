Add Spring MVC Test framework

This commit adds the spring-test-mvc project [1] to the Spring
Framework as part of the spring-test module.

The sources are added as a root-level project called "spring-test-mvc"
instead of under "spring-test" because the new sources need to be
compiled with Servlet 3 while the current "spring-test" sources require
Servlet 2.5 and the Eclipse IDE does not support having different
classpaths for the same project.

The Gradle build produces a single spring-test jar that contains
sources from both "spring-test" and "spring-test-mvc". This merge is
made possible through merge-dist.gradle as follows:

- jar tasks of the "from" project execute tasks of the "to" project
- "to" project is added to the classpath of the "from" project
- "to" project pom is updated with entries from the "from" project

For further details see documentation in merge-dist.gradle.

Special thanks to everyone who contributed to the initial development
of the Spring MVC Test framework:
