Reformat and add links to README

The readme is heavy on links and hard to read in source form when using
typical inline Markdown links. The following changes have been made to
increase readability.

 - Wrap lines at 80 characters
 - Use 'implicit link name' shortcut syntax as described at [1]
 - Add link to 'spring-mvc' Stack Overflow tag as well
 - Add link to new 'lifecycle of an issue' wiki doc
