Add request handling infrastructure

HandlerMapping, HandlerAdapter, HandlerResultHandler (+ HandlerResult)
as the basic request handling contracts. DispatcherHandler to drive
overall request handling.

DispatcherApp provides minimal implementations of the above contracts
enough to put together a running example that returns
200 text/plain "Hello world".
