Introduce PathPatternParser for optimized path matching

This commit introduces a PathPatternParser which parses request pattern
strings into PathPattern objects which can then be used to fast
match incoming string paths. The parser and matching supports the syntax
as described in SPR-14544. The code is optimized around the common usages
of request patterns and is designed to create very little transient
garbage when matching.
