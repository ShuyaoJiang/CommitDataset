Refine "." separator support for STOMP messaging

After this commit DefaultUserDestinationResolves no longer looks at
whether AntPathMatcher is configured with "." as separator and rather
expects to be explicitly told whether to keep the leading slash in
translated destinations which actually depends on what the message
broker supports (e.g. RabbitMQ "/", Artemis ".") or how it is
configured (simple broker could be either way).

There is also a minor improvement in SimpMessagingTemplate to ensure
user destinations are correctly formed based on what the
DefaultUserDestinationResolver expects. When using "." as separtor it
allows sending messages to "queue.q1" rather than "/queue.q1".

Issue: SPR-16275
