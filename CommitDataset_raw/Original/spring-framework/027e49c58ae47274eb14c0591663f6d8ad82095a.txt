Document default scripts for embedded databases

The reference manual currently documents the wrong file name for the
default data SQL script used by EmbeddedDatabaseBuilder. In addition,
the testing chapter of the reference manual does not link to the testing
section of the JDBC chapter.

 - Updated the "Testing data access logic with an embedded database"
   section of the reference manual appropriately.
 - Added a new paragraph to the "JDBC Testing Support" section of the
   testing chapter which cross references the "Testing data access logic
   with an embedded database" section.
