Avoid further 'type mismatch' errors in ExtendedBeanInfo

This change fixes further cases under JDK 6 in which setting a bridged
(e.g. String-returning) read method can conflict with an existing
corresponding bridge write method that accepts an Object parameter.

This appears to be a implementation difference between JDKs 6 and 7,
where the JDK 6 Introspector adds bridge methods and JDK 7 does not.

The solution here is to consistently null-out any existing write method
before setting the read method. We were doing this elsewhere in
ExtendedBeanInfo already, but these two changes make the approach
consistent throuhout.
