Remove HttpStatus from HttpMessageConversionException

HttpMessageConverter's are client and server and arguably shouldn't
contain a server-side concept such a response status.

The status field is recent, it was added to differentiate 400 vs 500
errors with Jackson 2.9+ but there is no need for it since the same
distinction is reflected in raising an HttpMessageNotReadableException
vs a general HttpMessageConversionException.
