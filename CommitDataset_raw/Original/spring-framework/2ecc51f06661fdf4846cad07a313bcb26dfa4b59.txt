Do not consider all @Components as configuration

Update ConfigurationClassUtils to only consider beans with @Bean
methods as 'lite' configuration candidates.

Prior to this commit all @Component beans were considered 'lite'
configuration candidates which could result in a large number of
ConfigurationClass instance being created that would ultimately be
ignored.
