SPR-2946 - Corrected documentation for lazy-init behaviour on Bean(Factory)PostProcessors.

Changed the documentation to correctly state that B(F)PP are instantiated eagerly no matter if they are explicitly marked as to be lazy initialized or the default-lazy-init attribute is used at a <beans /> element.
