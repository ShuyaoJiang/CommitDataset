Support inferred base package for @ComponentScan

Prior to this change, @ComponentScan required the declaration of
exactly one of the #value, #basePackage or #basePackageClasses
attributes in order to determine which package(s) to scan.

This commit introduces support for base package inference, relaxing the
above requirement and falling back to scanning the package in which the
@ComponentScan-annotated class is declared.
