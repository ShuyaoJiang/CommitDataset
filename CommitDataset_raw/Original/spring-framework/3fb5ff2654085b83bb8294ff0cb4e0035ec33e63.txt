Improve broker availability events

Use a single class for the broker availability event with a boolean
that indicates whether or not the broker is available, rather than one
event for an available broker and one event for an unavailable broker.

Publish broker availability events in SimpleBrokerMessageHandler so that
it can be used as a drop-in replacement for
StompBrokerRelayMessageHandler.
