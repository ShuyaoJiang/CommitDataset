Make ConcurrentReferenceHashMap more JIT friendly

Update `ConcurrentReferenceHashMap` to make some methods more inline
friendly, and to manually inline a few others. These minor optimizations
don't make a great deal of difference for most applications, but seem
worthwhile since we use `ConcurrentReferenceHashMap` for many internal
caches.

Closes gh-22566
