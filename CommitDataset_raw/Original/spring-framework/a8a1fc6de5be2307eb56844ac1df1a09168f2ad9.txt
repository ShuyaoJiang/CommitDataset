Earlier processing of forwarded headers

Forwarded headers are now processed before ServerWebExchange is created
through ForwardedHeaderTransformer which has the same logic as the
ForwardedHeaderFilter but works on the request only.

ForwardedHeaderFilter is deprecated as of 5.1 but if registered it is
removed from the list of filters and ForwardedHeaderTransformer is used
instead.

Issue: SPR-17072
