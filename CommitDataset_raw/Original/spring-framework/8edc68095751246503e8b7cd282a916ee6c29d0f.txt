Scale back static factory methods in ClientRequest

Following on the introduction of WebClientOperations in the last commit
this commit removes the HTTP method specific factory methods and also
scales back the builder options in ClientRequest.

ClientRequest is now expected to be used mainly from an
ExchangeFilterFunction which may modify the ClientRequest using the
from(ClientRequest) entry point rather creating from scratch.
