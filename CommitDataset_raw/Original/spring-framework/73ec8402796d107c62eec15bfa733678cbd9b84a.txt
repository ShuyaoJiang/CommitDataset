Remove dependency-check coverage from reference docs (SPR-7303)

- 'dependency-check' attribute of the <bean/> element was removed
  in the spring-beans-3.0 XSD; documentation now reflects this change.

- 'autodetect' was removed from the enumeration of possible values
  for autowire mode in the spring-beans-3.0 XSD; documentation now
  reflects this change.

Note that the underlying functionality for these values has not been
removed from Spring Core.  Users of Spring 3.0 who still need this
support may choose to use spring-beans-2.5.xsd in order to preserve
backward-compatibility.
