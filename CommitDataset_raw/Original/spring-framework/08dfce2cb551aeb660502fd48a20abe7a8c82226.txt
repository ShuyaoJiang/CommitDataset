Dedicated specificity comparator in PathPattern

The PathPattern compareTo method is now consistent with equals when
two patterns are of the same specificity but otherwise different.

Separately PathPattern now exposes a Comparator by specificity that
offers the current functionality of compareTo. This can be used for
actual sorting where we only care about specificity.
