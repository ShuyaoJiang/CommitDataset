Optional @XmlRootElement check in Jaxb2Marshaller

Before this commit, the Jaxb2Marshaller required all supported classes
to be annotated with @XmlRootElement. This commit adds a property
'checkForXmlRootElement' (default is true) which allows for un-annotated
classes.

This is especially useful for JAXB2 implementations that can use
external binding files, such as EclipseLink MOXy.
