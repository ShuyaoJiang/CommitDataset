Support n meta-annotation levels on methods in AnnotationUtils

Prior to this commit, the search algorithm used by the
findAnnotation(Method, Class) method in AnnotationUtils only found
direct annotations or direct meta-annotations (i.e., one level of
meta-annotations).

This commit reworks the search algorithm so that it supports arbitrary
levels of meta-annotations on methods. To make this possible, a new
findAnnotation(AnnotatedElement, Class) method has been introduced in
AnnotationUtils.

This fix also allows for the @Ignore'd tests in
TransactionalEventListenerTests to be re-enabled.
