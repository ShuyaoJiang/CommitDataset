Add doesNotExist match to HeaderResultMatchers

Prior to this commit, one could not test for the absence of
a specific HTTP header in a response.
Using header("X-Custom-Header", Matchers.nullValue()) would not
work because it tests for an empty value of an existing header.

This commit adds a doesNotExist method on the
HeaderResultMatcher.
