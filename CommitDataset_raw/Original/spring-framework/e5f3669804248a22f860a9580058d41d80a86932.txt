Introduced beta version of LiveBeansView for STS 3.1

LiveBeansView includes MBean exposure as well as Servlet exposure, with JSON as the initial output format. In order to identify an MBean per application, a new "getApplicationName()" method got introduced on the ApplicationContext interface, returning the Servlet container context path in case of a web application and defaulting to the empty String. MBean exposure can be driven by the "spring.liveBeansView.mbeanDomain" property, e.g. specifying "liveBeansView" as its value, leading to "liveBeansView:application=" or "liveBeansView:application=/myapp" style names for the per-application MBean.
