Disable streaming when reading to Resources in RestTemplate

Prior to this commit, the `ResourceHttpMessageConverter` would support
converting from an `HttpInputMessage` to a `InputStreamResource`. This
is valid when reading resources on the server side, but it's not
compatible with the way `RestTemplate` works.

The API exposed by `RestOperations` imply that the HTTP server response
should be fully consumed and properly closed by the time the `exchange`
method returns. In other words, this HTTP client does not support
streaming the HTTP response.

This commit allows the `ResourceHttpMessageConverter` to be configured
to disable read streaming when used in `RestTemplate`.
