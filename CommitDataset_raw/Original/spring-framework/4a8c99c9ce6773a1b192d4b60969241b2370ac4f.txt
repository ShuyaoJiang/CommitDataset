Consistent handling of 4xx/5xx status codes in WebClient

This commit changes the handling of 4xx/5xx status codes in the
WebClient to the following simple rule: if there is no way for the user
to get the response status code, then a WebClientException is returned.
If there is a way to get to the status code, then we do not return an
exception.
