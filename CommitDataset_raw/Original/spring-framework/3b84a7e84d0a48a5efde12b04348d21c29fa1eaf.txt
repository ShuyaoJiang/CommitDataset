Redesign MockMvcWebClientBuilder API

This commit introduces a dedicated build() method in
MockMvcWebClientBuilder to replace createWebClient(). In addition, the
configureWebClient() method has been renamed to withDelegate() and now
returns the builder for further customization.

This commit also overhauls the constructor and class-level Javadoc in
MockMvcWebClientBuilder for greater clarity to end users.
