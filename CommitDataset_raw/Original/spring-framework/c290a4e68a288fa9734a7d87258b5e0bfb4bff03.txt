SPR-8694 HTML5 updates to the "type" attribute of the Spring Form tags.

Since dynamic attributes were allowed in Spring 3, it raised the 
possibility to specify a type attribute on a number of the form tags.
Where it makes sense (see below) that attribute is now rejected
and reversely where it makes sense it is accepted.

InputTag allows types other than "text" but rejects type="radio" or 
type="checkbox" since there is a good reason for those to be used 
only in conjunction with the appropriate form library tags.

Other HTML input tags such as PasswordTag, HiddenInputTag, 
Checkbox(es)Tag and RadioBox(es)Tag check the dynamic attributes 
and reject them if they contain a type attribute since.
