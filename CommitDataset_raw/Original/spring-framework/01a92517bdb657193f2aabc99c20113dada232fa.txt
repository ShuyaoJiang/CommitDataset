Refactor RequestedContentTypeResolverBuilder

The revised builder emphasizes creating a list of resolvers either
built-in or custom with each top-level builder method resulting in
adding a resolver.

By default only the Header resolver is configured.

The path extension resolver is removed altogether to discourage its use
but is trivial to create manually with the helpf of
UriUtils#extractFileExtension + MediaTypeFactory.
