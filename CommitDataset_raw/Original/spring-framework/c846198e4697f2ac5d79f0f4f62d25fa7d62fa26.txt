Add support for global @ExceptionHandler methods

Before this change @ExceptionHandler methods could be located in and
apply locally within a controller. The change makes it possible to have
such methods applicable globally regardless of the controller that
raised the exception.

The easiest way to do that is to add them to a class annotated with
`@ExceptionResolver`, a new annotation that is also an `@Component`
annotation (and therefore works with component scanning). It is also
possible to register classes containing `@ExceptionHandler` methods
directly with the ExceptionHandlerExceptionResolver.

When multiple `@ExceptionResolver` classes are detected, or registered
directly, the order in which they're used depends on the the `@Order`
annotation (if present) or on the value of the order field (if the
Ordered interface is implemented).
