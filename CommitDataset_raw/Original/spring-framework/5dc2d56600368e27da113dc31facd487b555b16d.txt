Fix regression with covariant property return types

Prior to this change, the Property class introduced in 3.1 M2 validated
read/write property method pairs based on whether their parameter/return
types were equal to one another.  This precluded the valid possibility
of read method that returns a subtype of the write method's parameter
type, and represented a regression against 3.1 M1 and earlier versions.

The implementation now uses isAssignableFrom rather than a straight
equals check against the types.

Issue: SPR-8432
