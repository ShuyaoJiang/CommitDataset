Avoid resume-suspend race condition

This commit turns suspendReading() into a readingPaused() notification
that is invoked after a succession of reads stops because there is no
more demand. Sub-classes can use this notification to suspend, if that
applies to them.

Most importantly the notification is guaranteed not to overlap with
checkOnDataAvailable() which means that suspend does not need to be
atomic and guarded against resume. The two can and do compete all the
time when reading ends with no demand, and a request for demand arrives
concurrently.
