MethodHandles.Lookup.defineClass for CGLIB class definition purposes

Spring's CGLIB fork is patched with local copies of affected files here, introducing the notion of a "contextClass" (e.g. the proxy superclass) which gets passed through to ReflectUtils.defineClass for delegating to MethodHandles.Lookup.defineClass eventually, against a privateLookupIn(contextClass) lookup context on JDK 9/10/11.

Issue: SPR-15859
