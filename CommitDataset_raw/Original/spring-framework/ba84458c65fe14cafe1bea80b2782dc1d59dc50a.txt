Overhaul AnnotatedElementUtils

 - Methods which search for a specific annotation now properly ensure
   that the sought annotation was actually found.

 - Both the "get" and the "find" search algorithms no longer needlessly
   traverse meta-annotation hierarchies twice.

 - Both the "get" and the "find" search algorithms now properly
   increment the metaDepth when recursively searching within the
   meta-annotation hierarchy.

 - Redesigned getMetaAnnotationTypes() so that it doesn't needlessly
   search irrelevant annotations.

 - Documented and tested hasMetaAnnotationTypes().

 - Documented isAnnotated().
