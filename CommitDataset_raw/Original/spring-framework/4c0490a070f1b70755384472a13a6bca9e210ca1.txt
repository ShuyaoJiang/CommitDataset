Remove Cookie support from ServerHttpRequest

Although ServletHttpRequest provides access to Cookies, other
implementations may not. At the moment this was only needed
for SockJS to check the value of the JSESSIONID cookie. This
is now down by parsing the raw cookie values locally.

If comprehensive cookie support is to be added, we should
probably consider HttpHeaders as a potential candidate.
