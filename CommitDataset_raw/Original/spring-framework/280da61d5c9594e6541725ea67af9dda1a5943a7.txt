Fix empty body writing in EncoderHttpMessageWriter

Prior to this commit, an bug introduced in SPR-16949 prevented
`Mono.empty` bodies from being written to the response.

This commit ensures that empty bodies still trigger the writing to the
response and does not hang the processing of the exchange.

Issue: SPR-17220
