MvcUriCB no longer extends UriCB

Before 4.2 the MvcUriComponentsBuilder exposed only static factory
methods and therefore there should be no reason for it to extend
UriComponentsBuilder (design oversight). It's also highly unlikely
for application code to treat MvcUriCB as UriCB since there is no
need and no way to obtain an instance (constructor is protected).

This change removes the base class declaration from MvcUriCB.
