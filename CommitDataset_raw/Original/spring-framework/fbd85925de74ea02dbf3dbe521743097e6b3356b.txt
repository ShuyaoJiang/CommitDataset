Use Jackson improved default configuration everywhere

With this commit, Jackson builder is now used in spring-websocket
to create the ObjectMapper instance.

It is not possible to use the builder for spring-messaging
and spring-jms since these modules don't have a dependency on
spring-web, thus they now just customize the same features:
 - MapperFeature#DEFAULT_VIEW_INCLUSION is disabled
 - DeserializationFeature#FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES is disabled

Issue: SPR-12293
