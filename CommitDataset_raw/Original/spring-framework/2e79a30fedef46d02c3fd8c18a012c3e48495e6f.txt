Properly expand URI vars with regex

Before this commit UriComponents was capable of expanding URI vars that
may have contained a regular expressions (as supported with
@RequestMapping for example). However if the regular expressions
contained any nested "{}" the expand did not work correctly.

This commit sanitizes a URI template source removing any content
between nested "{}" prior to expanding. This works since we only care
about the URI variable name.

Issue: SPR-13311
