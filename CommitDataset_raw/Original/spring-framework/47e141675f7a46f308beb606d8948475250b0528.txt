Minor refactoring + polish reactive WebSocket support

Rename classes not specific to Tomcat:
TomcatWebSocketSession -> StandardWebSocketSession
TomcatWebSocketHandlerAdapter -> StandardWebSocketHandlerAdapter

WebSocketSessionSupport is renamed to AbstractWebSocketSession since it
actually is a WebSocketSession and pre-implements a number of methods.

ServerEndpointRegistration is now package private (mainly for use in
upgrade strategies) and renamed to DefaultServerEndpointConfig.
