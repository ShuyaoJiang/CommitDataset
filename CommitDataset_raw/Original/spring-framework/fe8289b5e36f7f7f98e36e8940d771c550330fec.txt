Implement description consistently across Resources

This commit ensures Resources have consistent, non-empty, meaningful
implementations for getDescription(), thus ensuring that calls to
toString() (e.g., in log statements) no longer return an empty String.

This commit also polishes the Javadoc for various Resource
implementations.
