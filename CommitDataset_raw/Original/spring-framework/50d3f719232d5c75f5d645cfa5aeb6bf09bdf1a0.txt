Added get(key, type) method to Cache interface

This new get variant not only allows for generically specifying the required value type; it also skips the ValueWrapper that the standard get method returns. Note that it is not possible to differentiate between non-existing cache entries and cached null values that way; for that purpose, the standard get variant needs to be used.
