Fix NPE in GzipResourceResolver

This change fixes a NullPointerException in GzipResourceResolver, which
assumed that calls to the `resolveResource` method were made with only
non-null values for request.

This is not the case for the VersionResourceResolver, which tries to
resolve resources that aren't requested per se by the HTTP request.

Issue: SPR-13149
