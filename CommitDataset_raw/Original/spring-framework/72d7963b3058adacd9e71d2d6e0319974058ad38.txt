Polish ConversionService tests

- Now correctly using @Test(expected=...) where appropriate.

- Renamed DefaultConversionTests to DefaultConversionServiceTests.

- Moved all tests related to DefaultConversionService from
  GenericConversionServiceTests to DefaultConversionServiceTests.

- No longer printing to System.out.

- Removed all duplicate instantiation of conversion services.

- Now using Java 8 streams to simplify implementations of custom test
  converters. Also using streams in tests where appropriate.
