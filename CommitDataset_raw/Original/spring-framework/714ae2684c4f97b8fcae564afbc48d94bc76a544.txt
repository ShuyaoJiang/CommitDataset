Support for global separator in JDBC namespace

Previously, if a database needs to be initialized with several scripts
and many (or all) use a custom separator, said separator must be repeated
for each script.

This commit introduces a `separator` property at the parent element level
that can be used to customize the default separator. This is available
for both the `initialize-database` and `embedded-database` elements.
