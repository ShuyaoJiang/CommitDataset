Always set heart-beat header in STOMP CONNECTED frames

Since SPR-10954, the SimpleBrokerMessageHandler supports `heart-beats`.

Even if the STOMP spec states that the `heart-beat` header is OPTIONAL,
and if absent considered as `heart-beat: 0,0`,
some clients rely on this to be set in CONNECTED frames.

This commit adds this header information even if no task
scheduler/heart-beat have been configured.
