PathMatching options:configure all HandlerMappings

Since SPR-11486 and SPR-10163, Path Matching options can be configured
to customize path matching options for RequestMappingHandlerMapping.
Prior to this commit, the defined pathMatcher and pathHelper instances
were only used in RequestMappingHandlerMapping.

This commit now registers pathMatcher and pathHelper beans under
well-known names and share them with several HandlerMappings beans,
such as ViewControllerMappings and ResourcesMappings.

Issue: SPR-11753
