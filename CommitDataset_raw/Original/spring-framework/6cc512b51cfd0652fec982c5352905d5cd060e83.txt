Ensure async Callables are in sync with the call stack

After this change each call stack level pushes and pops an async
Callable to ensure the AsyncExecutionChain is in sync with the
call stack. Before this change, a controller returning a "forward:"
prefixed string caused the AsyncExecutionChain to contain a
extra Callables that did not match the actual call stack.
