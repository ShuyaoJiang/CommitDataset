Respect @Configuration(value) for @Imported classes

Prior to this commit, @Configuration classes included via @Import (or
via automatic registration of nested configuration classes) would
always be registered with a generated bean name, regardless of whether
the user had specified a 'value' indicating a customized bean name, e.g.

    @Configuration("myConfig")
    public class AppConfig { ... }

Now this bean name is propagated as intended in all cases, meaning that
in the example above, the resulting bean definition of type AppConfig
will be named "myConfig" regardless how it was registered with the
container -- directly against the application context, via component
scanning, via @Import, or via automatic registration of nested
configuration classes.
