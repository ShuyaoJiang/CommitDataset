Support meta-annotation overrides in ASM processing

Prior to this commit, Spring supported meta-annotation attribute
overrides in custom composed annotations with reflection-based
annotation processing but not with ASM-based annotation processing.

This commit ensures that meta-annotation attribute overrides are
supported in AnnotationMetadataReadingVisitor.getAnnotationAttributes().

Issue: SPR-11574
