Add HttpRequest.getMethodValue

This commit introduces a new method in HttpRequest:
`String getMethodValue`, which returns the HTTP method as a String.
Furthermore, HttpRequest.getMethod() has been given a default
implementation using this String value in combination with
`HttpMethod.resolve`.

Issue: SPR-15545
