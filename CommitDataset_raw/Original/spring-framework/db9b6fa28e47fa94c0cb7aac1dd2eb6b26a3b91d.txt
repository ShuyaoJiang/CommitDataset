Split tests for MethodMessageHandlers impl.

Prior to this commit, all MethodMessageHandlers tests were
implemented in a single class. Since SimpAnnotationMsgHandler
has been refactored with an abstract class, tests also
needed such a refactoring.

This commit creates test fixtures for AbstractMethodMessageHandler.
