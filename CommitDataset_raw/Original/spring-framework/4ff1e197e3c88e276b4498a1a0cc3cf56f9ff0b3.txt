Clean up spring-tx tests warnings

Clean up compiler warnings in the tests of spring-tx. This commit
adds type parameters to all the types (mostly `List` and `Map`). In
addition it uses Java 5 autoboxing to get rid of several `new Integer`
(except in cases where it's needed).

After this commit the only warnings in spring-tx left are in
`TransactionAttributeSourceTests`` that code would never compile with
generics.
