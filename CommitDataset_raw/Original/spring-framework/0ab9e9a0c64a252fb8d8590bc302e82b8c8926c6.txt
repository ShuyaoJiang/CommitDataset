Upgrade AspectJ from 1.6.8 to 1.6.12

 - Spring remains compatible against AJ version 1.6.8, but is now
   compiling and testing against 1.6.12

 - Encountered what appears to be an AJ bug introduced in 1.6.10: an
   assertion in org.aspectj.weaver.UnresolvedType causes a false
   negative failure when encountering org.springframework.io.Resource
   arrays, e.g. "[org.springframework.io.Resource@xxx". This problem
   has been reported to the AJ team and in the meantime, the recommended
   workaround is to disable assertions either completely, or at least
   selectively with

       -disableassertions:org.aspectj.weaver.UnresolvedType

Issue: SPR-7989, SPR-9272
