Deprecate HttpStatus.MOVED_TEMPORARILY

Deprecate HttpStatus.MOVED_TEMPORARILY in favor of HttpStatus.FOUND
since HttpStatus.valueOf(302) will always return FOUND.

The name of the 302 status code was changed between HTTP 1.0 and
HTTP 1.1 but the underlying meaning remains the same.

Issue: SPR-10300
