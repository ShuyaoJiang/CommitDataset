Minor refactoring in PathPattern

Rename getPathRemaining to matchStartOfPath since the method does
match and to be more clear about what the method and the return value
intuitively follows.

Remove matchStart which matches the start of the pattern (rather than
the start of the path). It is a use case that does not come up in
request mapping.
