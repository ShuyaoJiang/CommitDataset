Add support for repeatable JmsListener

Previously, a method could only declare one Jms endpoint so if several
destinations share the exact same business logic, you'd still need one
separate method declaration per destination.

We now make sure that JmsListener is a repeatable annotation, introducing
JmsListeners for pre Java8 use cases.
