Support arbitrary levels of meta-annotations in TypeDescriptor

Prior to this commit, the `getAnnotation()` method in `TypeDescriptor`
only supported a single level of meta-annotations. In other words, the
annotation hierarchy would not be exhaustively searched.

This commit provides support for arbitrary levels of meta-annotations
in `TypeDescriptor` by delegating to `AnnotationUtils.findAnnotation()`
within `TypeDescriptor.getAnnotation()`.

Issue: SPR-12793
