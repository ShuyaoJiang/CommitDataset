PathVariable consistently reflects value up to 1st ";"

Given "/{foo}" and "/a=42;c=b", previously that would be treated as a
sequence of matrix vars with an empty path variable. After the change
the path variable "foo" is "a=42".

This should be ok for backawards compatibility since it's unlikely for
anything to rely on an empty path variable.
