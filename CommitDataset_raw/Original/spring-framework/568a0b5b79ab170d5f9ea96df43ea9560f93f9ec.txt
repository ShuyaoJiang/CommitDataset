Make ResponseSpec.expectBody Kotlin extension usable

Prior to this commit, due to KT-5464 type inference issue there was not
proper way to provide body expectations with WebTestClient. This commit
provides a workaround by updating the existing Kotlin extension to
return a Kotlin compatible API.

Issue: SPR-15692
