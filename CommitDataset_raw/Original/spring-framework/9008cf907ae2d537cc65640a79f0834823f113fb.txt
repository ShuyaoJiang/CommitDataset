Overhaul custom ApplicationEvent documentation (SPR-7422, SPR-7395)

Documentation now:

- Reflects generic use of ApplicationListener interface

- Demonstrates use of ApplicationEventPublisher(Aware) instead of
  ApplicationContext(Aware) for publishing custom events

- Provides a more complete narrative as to how each of the publisher,
  listener, and event objects interact with one another
