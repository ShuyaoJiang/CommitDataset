Handle multiple conditional request headers

Prior to this change, setting both "If-None-Match" and
"If-Unmodified-Since" conditional request headers would check for both
conditions to be met.

This commit fixes this behavior to follow the RFC7232 Section 6:
> entity tags are presumed to be more accurate than date validators

So in case both conditions are present, the "If-None-Match" condition
takes precedence.

Issue: SPR-14224
