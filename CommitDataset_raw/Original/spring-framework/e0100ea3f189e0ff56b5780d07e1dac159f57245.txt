Update logging documentation to include Log4j 2

This also updates the version numbers provided in the sample pom.xml
snippets for configuring logging for SLF4J and Log4j 1.x. A sample
log4j2.xml file is also given with the same configuration as
demonstrated in the log4j.properties example. The link to the Log4j 1.x
site has been fixed to point to the 1.2 URL (do note that Log4j 1.2 is
end of life and is not compatible with JDK 9+).
