Generate bracketless tag id in Velocity forms

Before this change if Velocity Spring form macro was bound to a path
which contains square brackets, those brackets would also appear in id
of generated tag, making the id invalid.

As of this fix all Velocity Spring form macros generate tag with id
that does not contain square brackets.

Issue: SPR-5172
