Ensure test fails for the correct reason

Prior to this commit, a dynamic test in
FailingBeforeAndAfterMethodsSpringExtensionTestCase was failing but for
the wrong reason. Namely, the @Configuration class was private which
resulted in an IllegalStateException being thrown, when in fact
an AssertionFailedError was expected.

This commit addresses this by introducing an explicit check for an
AssertionFailedError.

Issue: SPR-4365
