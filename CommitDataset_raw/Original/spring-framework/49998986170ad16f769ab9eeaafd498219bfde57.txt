Update to Gradle 3.4-rc-2

We need to explicitly apply Dependency Management to the root
project since it depends on modules that use dependency management.
We need to ensure dependency management is applied after propdeps-maven
to avoid an ordering issue [1]

An update to propdeps was necessary to be compatable with Gradle
3.4+
