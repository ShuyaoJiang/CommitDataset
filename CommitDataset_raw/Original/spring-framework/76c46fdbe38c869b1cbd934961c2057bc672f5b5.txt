Change resource handler XML Namespace

This commit changes the way a <mvc:resource-cache> can be configured
with a user defined Cache instance.

Now a reference to a CacheManager Bean and a Cache name must be
provided. This is a more flexible configuration for typical XML setups.

  <mvc:resource-cache
    cache-manager="resourceCache"
    cache-name="test-resource-cache"/>
