Simplify WebSocket client implementationss in WebFlux

1. Eliminate WebSocketClientSupport base class whose main value was
to provide logging but those methods get in the way of inserting a
log prefix.

2. Remove checks and synchronization in lifecycle methods of Jetty
client since underlying Jetty client already has that.
