Add concurrent test and fix potential NPE

After SPR-12884 (4.2 RC1) introduced support for a selector header
expression on SUBSCRIBE frames, messages from the destination cache
are further filtered based on the selector expression. While adding a
test to find subscriptions at the same time as unsubscribing, a
potential NPE was exposed. This commit fixes the NPE.

Issue: SPR-13204
