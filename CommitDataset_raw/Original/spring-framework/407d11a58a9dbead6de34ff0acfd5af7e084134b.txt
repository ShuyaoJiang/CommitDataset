Server-side session support

This commit adds initial support for a maintaining a server-side
session with attributes across HTTP requests. The WebSession
abstraction can be accessed via WebServerExchange from a WebFilter or
the target WebHandler.

The session sub-package contains additional abstractions for creating
and managing sessions providing a basis for extensibility (e.g. Spring
Session). Those include WebSessionManager, SessionIdStrategy, and
SessionStore along with a cookie-based session id strategy and an
in-memory session store in use by default.

Note that the current API does not provide a way to invalidate or
re-create the session from server side code.
