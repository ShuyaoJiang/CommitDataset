Support Kotlin suspending functions in MethodParameter

Before this commit, the return type for Kotlin suspending functions
(as returned by MethodParameter#getParameterType and
MethodParameter#getGenericReturnType methods) was incorrect.

This change leverages Kotlin reflection instead of Java one
to return the correct type.

Closes gh-21058
