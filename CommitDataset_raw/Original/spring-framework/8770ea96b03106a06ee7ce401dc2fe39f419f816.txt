Expose Environment ConfigurationService

AbstractEnvironment delegates to an underlying ConfigurationService when
processing methods such as getProperty(String name, Class<?> targetType)

Accessor methods have been added to the ConfigurableEnvironment
interface that allow this service to be updated or replaced.
