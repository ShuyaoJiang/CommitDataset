Preserve shadowed fields in DirectFieldAccessor

Prior to this change, DirectFieldAccessor would ignore fields shadowed
in subclasses, favoring the last field processed, which happens to be
the most super declaration based on the way ReflectionUtils.doWithFields
works.

Because the locally shadowed field may be of a different type that the
superclass declaration, it is most correct to preserve and work with
the shadowed field.
