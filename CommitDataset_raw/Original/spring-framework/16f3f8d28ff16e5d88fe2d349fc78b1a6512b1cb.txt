Add close() method on HTTP client response

Before this commit, there was no way to signal the HTTP client that we
were done consuming the response. Without that, the underlying client
library cannot know when it is safe to release the associated resources
(e.g. the HTTP connection).

This commit adds new `close()` methods on both `ClientHttpResponse`
and `ClientResponse`. This methods is non-blocking and its behavior
depends on the library, its configuration, HTTP version, etc.

At the `WebClient` level, `close()` is called automatically if we
consume the response body through the `ResponseSpec` or the
`ClientResponse` itself.

Note that it is *required* to call `close()` manually otherwise; not
doing so might create resource leaks or connection issues.
