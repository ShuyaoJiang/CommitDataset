Introduce @Nested tests with constructor injection

This commit introduces @Nested tests to verify support for constructor
injection when using the SpringExtension.

One of the tests is disabled on Java 8 due to a bug in javac that was
first fixed in JDK 9.

See https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/1345 for details.
