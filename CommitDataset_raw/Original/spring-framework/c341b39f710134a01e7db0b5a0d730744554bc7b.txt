Move "What's New" reference manual chapter to the wiki

A "What's New" page has been created in the Spring Framework wiki:

https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/What's-New-in-the-Spring-Framework

This commit therefore links to the new wiki page from the appendix of
the reference manual and deletes the existing "What's New" chapter from
the reference manual.

Issue: SPR-14449
