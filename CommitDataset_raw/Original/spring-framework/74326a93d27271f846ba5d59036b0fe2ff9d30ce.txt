Fix SPEL tests when using maven.  With the maven test runner expression.spel.SetValueTests is run before expression.spel.EvaluationTests. The order is reversed in eclipse/spring-build.  Static variables are modifed in SetValueTests that cause EvaluationTests to fail if it is run first.  Make a simple fix so SetValueTests uses a local evaluation context variable instead of a static variable.
