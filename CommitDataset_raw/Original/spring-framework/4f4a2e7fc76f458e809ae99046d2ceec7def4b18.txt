Update documentation with regards to differences between @MVC 3.0/3.1

Although the reference documentation listed the new @MVC support
classes and their benefits, it did not explicitly mention a few
use cases that are no longer supported. There is now a specific
section on the new support classes listing exactly what is not
supported.

Similary the @RequestMapping annotation never refered explicitly
to the existence of old and new support and never made it clear
exactly what the differences are.

Both have not been corrected.
