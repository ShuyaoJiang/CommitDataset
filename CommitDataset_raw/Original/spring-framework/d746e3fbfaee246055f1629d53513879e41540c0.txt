Rollback AntPathMatcher behavior for ".*" comparisons

Prior to this commit, AntPathMatcher had been refactored for SPR-6741.
During that process, a key feature has been removed:
When comparing two patterns, pattern elements (*, {}, etc) are counted
to score those patterns. When a pattern ends with ".*", the ending
wildcard should not be counted against pattern elements for this
pattern.

This commit reintroduces that behavior.

Issue: SPR-6741
