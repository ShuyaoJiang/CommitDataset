Fix minor problems and polish reference docs

Problems

 - Eliminate &mdash; in favor of &#151;

   &mdash; was causing 'no such entity' errors during docbook
   processing; &#151; produces the equivalent output.

 - Fix column issues in appendices

   column counts were set to 3, when they are in fact 4. This passed
   under DocBook 4 and Spring Build for unknown reasons, but caused a
   hard stop under DocBook 5 and the docbook-reference-plugin.

 - Add jdbc callout section in docbook 5-friendly style

   use <co/> tags as advertised in DocBook documentation.

 - Set correct widths for PDF ref doc images

   images were rendering larger than the PDF page; just set all to
   width=400 and everything looks good.

Polish

 - Update reference doc copyright to 2012

 - Remove "work-in-progress" language from ref docs

 - Update maven URLs to repo.springsource.org

 - Update javadoc urls from 3.0.x/javadoc-api => current/api

 - Replace hardcoded "3.1" with ${version} in ref doc
