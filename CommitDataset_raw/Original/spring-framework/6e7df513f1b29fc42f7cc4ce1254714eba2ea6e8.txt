Exclude jcl-over-slf4j from tiles-core dependency

tiles-core-3 brings in a dependency on jcl-overl-slf4 which causes
an slf4j delegation loop as explained at [1] when tests run inside
Eclipse. Other modules that depend on tiles-core like
(tiles-servlet, tiles-jsp) have also had the exclusion added since
they seem to bring it in as well.
