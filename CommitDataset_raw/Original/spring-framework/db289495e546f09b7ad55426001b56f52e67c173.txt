Pretty print option for Jackson converter and view

Jackson serialization supports pretty printing. Usually it's enabled
by invoking ObjectMapper.configure(..), which is not convenient for
apps with XML configuration. The Jackson HttpMessageConverter and View
now both have a prettyPrint property.

A second more serious issue is documented here:
https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/12

The workaround discussed at the above link has been implemented.
