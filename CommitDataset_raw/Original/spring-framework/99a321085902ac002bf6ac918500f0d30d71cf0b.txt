Refactor tests with ScriptedSubscriber

Reactor recently added the `ScriptedSubscriber` in its new
`reactor-addons` module. This `Subscriber` revissits the previous
`TestSubscriber` with many improvements, including:

* scripting each expectation
* builder API that guides you until the final verification step
* virtual time support

This commit refactor all existing tests to use this new
infrastructure and removed the `TestSubscriber` implementation.

Issue: SPR-14800
