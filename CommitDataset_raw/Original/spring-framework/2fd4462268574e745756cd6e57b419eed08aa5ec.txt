Upgrade build to Gradle 2.14

In the process of upgrading the build to use Gradle 2.14, the
setFieldOnLegacyEntityWithSideEffectsInToString() test method in
ReflectionTestUtilsTests began to fail. The reason is that the log
level for ReflectionTestUtils is now DEBUG by default with Gradle 2.14.
The apparent cause is that log4j was present on the test runtime
classpath for the spring-test module with all previous versions of
Gradle (via a transitive optional dependency from another project that
spring-test depends on). Thus the configuration in log4j.properties in
spring-test was previously honored, but with Gradle 2.14 a different
commons logging implementation is picked up.

Thus, in addition to upgrading the build to Gradle 2.14, this commit
introduces an explicit test runtime dependency on log4j in the
spring-test module.

The discovered bug in ReflectionTestUtils regarding DEBUG log level
will be addressed separately.
