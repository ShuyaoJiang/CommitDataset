Introduce value attribute in @RestController

Stereotype annotations should support a 'value' attribute for
specifying the name of the Spring-managed component; however,
@RestController currently does not provide such an attribute.

This commit introduces a 'value' attribute in @RestController so that
developers can provide custom names for components annotated with
@RestController.

Issue: SPR-11360
