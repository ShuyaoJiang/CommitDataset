MockMvc request builder preserves double slashes

The MockHttpServletRequestBuilder now uses java.net.URI internally
rather than UriComponents.

This means that for the MockMvcRequestBuilders method variants that
accept a java.net.URI we can use it as is. The difference is almost
none but it does mean that you can create a URI with double slashes
(for testing purposes) and have it remain that way.
