Add Gradle task for building zip with dependencies

Some Spring Framework users and teams cannot use transitive dependency
management tools like Maven, Gradle and Ivy. For them, a `distZip` task
has been added to allow for creating a Spring Framework distribution
from source that includes all optional and required runtime
dependencies for all modules of the framework.

This 'dist-with-deps' zip is not published to the SpringSource
repository nor to the SpringSource community download page. It is
strictly an optional task introduced as a convenience to the users
mentioned above.

Detailed instructions for building this zip locally have been added to
the wiki and the README has been updated with a link to that new doc.

Issue: SPR-6575
