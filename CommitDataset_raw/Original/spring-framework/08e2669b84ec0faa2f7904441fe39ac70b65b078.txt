Fix infinite recursion bug in nested @Configuration

Prior to this commit, an infinite recursion would occur if a
@Configuration class were nested within its superclass, e.g.

  abstract class Parent {
      @Configuration
      static class Child extends Parent { ... }
  }

This is because the processing of the nested class automatically
checks the superclass hierarchy for certain reasons, and each
superclass is in turn checked for nested @Configuration classes.

The ConfigurationClassParser implementation now prevents this by
keeping track of known superclasses, i.e. once a superclass has been
processed, it is never again checked for nested classes, etc.

Issue: SPR-8955
