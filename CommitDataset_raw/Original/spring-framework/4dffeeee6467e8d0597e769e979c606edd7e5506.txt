Introduce alias for 'value' attribute in caching annotations

This commit introduces new 'cacheNames' attributes (analogous to the
existing attribute of the same name in @CacheConfig) as aliases for the
'value' attributes in @Cacheable, @CachePut, and @CacheEvict.

In addition, SpringCacheAnnotationParser.getAnnotations() has been
refactored to support synthesized annotations.
