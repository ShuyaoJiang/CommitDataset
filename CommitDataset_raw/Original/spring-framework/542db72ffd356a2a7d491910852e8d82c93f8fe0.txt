Add first draft of IDEA code formatting

This commit provides a first attempt at defining a standard code
formatting scheme for the Spring Framework in Intellij IDEA.

These are the major changes compared to standard settings:

* default indent option to use tab character instead of space for
  all languages
* one space before the left brace of an array initializer
* keep when reformating: multiple expressions in one line,
  simple blocks in one line
* method declaration parameters: do not align when multiline
* else, catch and finally on new line
* keep one space before } (solely use to keep the space between the
  end of the last method and the end of the class)
* minimum blank line after class header 0 (instead of 1)
* Disabled Javadoc formatting
* class count to trigger static import to 50 (to prevent
  import org.foo.*; instead of listing the classes of org.foo)
* changed the import sequence to import in the following order:
  static imports, java.*, javax.*, others, org.springframework.*. Each
  sequence is separated by a space
