Add smart logging for disconnected SockJS clients

The Servlet API does not provide notifications when a client
disconnects, see see https://java.net/jira/browse/SERVLET_SPEC-44.
Therefore network IO failures may occur simply because a client has
gone away. Before this change that could fill logs with unnecessary
stack traces.

After this change we make a best effort to identify such network
failures, on a per-server basis (tested with Jetty, Tomcat, Glassfish,
and WildFly), and log them under a separate log category.

A simple one-line message is logged at DEBUG level (i.e. no stack trace)
while a full stack trace is shown at TRACE level.
