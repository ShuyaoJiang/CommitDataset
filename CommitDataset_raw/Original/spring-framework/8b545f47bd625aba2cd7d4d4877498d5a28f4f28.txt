Fix remote context handling in UrlTag

Prior to this change, the `UrlTag` would simply append the remote
context and the path value in case of a context relative URL.

The following code snippet would output "//foo":

```
<spring:url value="/foo" context="/" />
```

This change now removes trailing slashes in remote context to avoid
this.
