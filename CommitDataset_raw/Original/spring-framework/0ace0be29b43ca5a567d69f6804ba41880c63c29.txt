Fix annotation value mapping regression

Refine `TypeMappedAnnotation.getValueFromMetaAnnotation` to correctly
account for aliases when finding values from meta-annotations. Prior
to this commit, only convention based mappings were considered when
searching for values on meta-annotations. This meant that declared
meta-annotations that used aliases could return the "default value"
rather than the merged value.

Closes gh-22654
