Enforce UTF-8 response encoding in SseEmitter

This commit sets the response content type to
"text/event-stream;charset=UTF-8". Even if the SSE spec says that the
encoding should always be UTF-8 and that specifying the charset is
optional, we're setting it in all cases, since some containers might use
the default encoding "ISO-8859-1" and confuse HTTP clients.
