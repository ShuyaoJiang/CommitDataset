This commit picks up where 8ff9e818a53aed90da80e68f4948147f07bec394
left off.

Specifically, this commit introduces support that allows a single
element attribute to override an array attribute with a matching
component type when synthesizing annotations (e.g., in annotations
synthesized from attributes that have been merged from the annotation
hierarchy above a composed annotation).
