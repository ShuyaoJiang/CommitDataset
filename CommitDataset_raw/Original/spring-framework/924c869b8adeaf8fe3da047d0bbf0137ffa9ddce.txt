Remove note on singleton-scoped proxy raising BCE

Before this change bean scopes chapter in Spring reference documentation
had a note which mentioned that creating a scoped proxy for singleton-
or prototype-scoped beans will throw BeanCreationException.

This is no longer the case and this change removes the mentioned note.

Issue: SPR-7940
