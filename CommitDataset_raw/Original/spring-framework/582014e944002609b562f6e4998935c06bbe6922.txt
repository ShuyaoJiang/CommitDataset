Support HTTP range requests in MVC Controllers

Prior to this commit, HTTP Range requests were only supported by the
ResourceHttpRequestHandler when serving static resources.

This commit improves the `HttpEntityMethodProcessor` and
the `RequestResponseBodyMethodProcessor`. They now extract
`ResourceRegion`s from the `Resource` instance returned by the
Controller and let the Resource-related message converters
handle the writing of the resource (including partial writes).

Controller methods can now handle Range requests for
return types that extend Resource or HttpEntity:

    @RequestMapping("/example/video.mp4")
    public Resource handler() { }

    @RequestMapping("/example/video.mp4")
    public HttpEntity<Resource> handler() { }
