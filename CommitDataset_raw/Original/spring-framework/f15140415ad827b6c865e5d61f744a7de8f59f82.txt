Properly detect available port on localhost in SocketUtils

SocketUtils is used to find available ports on localhost; however,
prior to this commit, SocketUtils incorrectly reported a port as
available on localhost if another process was already bound to
localhost on the given port but not to other network interfaces. In
other words, SocketUtils determined that a given port was available for
some interface though not necessarily for the loopback interface.

This commit addresses this issue by refactoring SocketUtils so that it
tests the loopback interface to ensure that the port is actually
available for localhost.

Issue: SPR-13321
