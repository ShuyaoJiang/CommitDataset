Upgrade to AspectJ 1.7.1

This change upgrades the spring-framework build to AspectJ 1.7.1 to
ensure compatibility. We remain backward-compatible to at least AJ
1.6.12 (the previous version), and likely back to 1.6.7.

AJ 1.7 allows for weaving Java 7 bytecode, particularly with regard
to invokedynamic instructions, and furthermore makes improvements to
the aspectj language itself to allow users to take advantage of Java 7-
style language features within aspects. See [1] for details.
