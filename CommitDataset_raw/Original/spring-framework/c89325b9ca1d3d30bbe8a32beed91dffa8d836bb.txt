Add WebLogicRequestUpgradeStrategy

This change creates an AbstractTyrusRequestUpgradeStrategy shared
between the WebLogic and GlassFish sub-classes.

The version of Tyrus is lowered to 1.3.5 to match the version used
in WebLogic (12.1.3) and that in turn requires a little extra effort
in the base AbstractTyrusRequestUpgradeStrategy to make up for
changes that have taken place from Tyrus 1.3.5 to 1.7.

Issue: SPR-11293
