Minor refactoring in PathPatternParser

Remove the separator constructor argument (but preserve internal
functionality) now that PathPatternParser is more explicitly purposed
for URL paths and in any case the use of an alternate separator would
also requires a similar input option on the PathContainer parsing side.
