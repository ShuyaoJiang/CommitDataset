Generate spring-oxm test classes and bindings

 - Generate castor test classes with genCastor task
 - Generate xmlbeans test classes with genXmlbeans task
 - Generate JAXB2 test classes with genJaxb task
 - Generate JiBX bindings by extending existing compileTestJava task

Test classes are written into their own dedicated output folders and
tied into the spring-oxm classpath using the files(...).builtBy(...)
directive.

Incremental build works as expected across all of these customizations.

`gradle eclipse` and `gradle idea` generate correct .project / .iml
metadata respectively, i.e., these special cases do not cause a problem
in the IDE (as they used to prior to the move to Gradle).
