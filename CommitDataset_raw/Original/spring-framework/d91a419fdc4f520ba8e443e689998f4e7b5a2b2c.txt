Fix SpEL JavaBean compliance for setters

Prior to this change, SpEL was capable of handling getter methods for
property names having a lowercase first letter and uppercase second
letter such as:

    public String getiD() { ... }

However, setters with the same naming arrangement were not supported,
e.g.:

    public void setiD() { ... }

This commit ensures that setters and getters are treated by SpEL equally
in this regard, such that "iD"-style property names may be used anywhere
within SpEL expressions.

Issue: SPR-10122, SPR-9123
