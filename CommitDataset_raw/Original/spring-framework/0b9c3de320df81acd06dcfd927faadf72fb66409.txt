Sanitize request URL in ResourceUrlEncodingFilter

Prior to this change, ResourceUrlEncodingFilter and ResourceUrlProvider
would try to resolve the resource path using the full request URL (i.e.
request path and request parameters), whereas the request path is the
only information to consider.
This would lead to StringIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions when the path +
request params information was given to the AntPathMatcher.

This commit makes the appropriate change to both
ResourceUrlEncodingFilter and ResourceUrlProvider, in order to only
select the request path.
