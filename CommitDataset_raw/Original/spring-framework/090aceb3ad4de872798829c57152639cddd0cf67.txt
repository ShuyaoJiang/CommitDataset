Fix repeated calls to DataBuffer.write(CharSequence, Charset)

Prior to this commit, repeated calls to `DataBuffer.write(CharSequence,
Charset)` would not write the given chars to the expected position in
the original buffer.

This commit fixes that by writing to the `outBuffer.position()`, offset
by the current `DataBuffer.writePosition()`.

Fixes gh-22484
