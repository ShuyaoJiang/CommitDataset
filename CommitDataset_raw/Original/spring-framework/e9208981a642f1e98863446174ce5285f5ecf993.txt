SPR-9062 Fix bug with ambiguous path and HTTP method request mappings

A direct path match with incorrect HTTP request method was causing another
request mapping with a pattern and a correct HTTP method to be ignored.
The bug affects the new @MVC support classes
(i.e. RequestMappingHandlerMapping).
