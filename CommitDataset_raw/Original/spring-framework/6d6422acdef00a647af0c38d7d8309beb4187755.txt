Support for generics-based events

Update the event publishing infrastructure to support generics-based
events, that is support ApplicationListener implementations that define
a generic event, something like:

public class MyListener
        implements ApplicationListener<GenericEvent<String>> { ... }

This listener should only receive events that are matching the generic
signature, for instance:

public class StringEvent extends GenericEvent<String> { ... }

Note that because of type erasure, publishing an event that defines the
generic type at the instance level will not work. In other words,
publishing "new GenericEvent<String>" will not work as expected as type
erasure will define it as GenericEvent<?>.

To support this feature, use the new GenericApplicationListener that
supersedes SmartApplicationListener to handle generics-based even types via
`supportsEventType` that takes a ResolvableType instance instead of the
simple Class of the event. ApplicationEventMulticaster has an additional
method to multicast an event based on the event and its ResolvableType.
