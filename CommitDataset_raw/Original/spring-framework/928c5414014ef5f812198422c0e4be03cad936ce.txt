Simplify MonoToListenableFutureAdapter

Collapse the package private AbstractMonoToListenableFutureAdapter into
its only sub-class MonoToListenableFutureAdapter. There is no need for
such an abstract class that makes it possible to adapt from one source
to a different target type. That's already covered by
ListenableFutureAdapter.

Follow-up refactoring for SPR-17336.
