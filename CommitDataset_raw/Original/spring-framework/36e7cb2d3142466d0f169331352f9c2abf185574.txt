Improve documentation of annotated class support in the TCF

Updated all Javadoc in the Spring TestContext Framework (TCF) to explain
and refer to 'annotated classes' instead of 'configuration classes'.

Specifically, @ContextConfiguration now explicitly defines what is meant
by 'annotated classes', and various other classes now refer to this
definition. Otherwise, the term 'configuration class' has simply been
replaced with 'annotated class'.

Also deleted cross references to deprecated JUnit 3.8 classes and
formatted Javadoc in general for greater readability.

Issue: SPR-9401
