Introduce method to allow a pattern to partially consume a path

With this change there is a new getPathRemaining() method on
PathPattern objects. It is called with a path and returns
the path remaining once the path pattern in question has
matched as much as it can of that path. For example if the
pattern is /fo* and the path is /foo/bar then getPathRemaining
will return /bar. This allows for a set of pathpatterns
to work together in sequence to match a complete entire path.
