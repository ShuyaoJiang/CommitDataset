Add custom cache manager per cache operation

It is now possible to specify the CacheManager to use per operation.
The related cache annotation now has an extra attribute that defines
the name of the CacheManager bean to use.  The cache manager that
was previously used is therefore a 'default' cache manager (i.e. the
one to use if no custom cache manager has been set on the operation).
