Move reference docs => src/reference

This change eliminates the spring-framework-reference subproject, moving
these sources into the root project's own src directory.

This makes sense because the reference docs span all submodules, and
also because api Javadoc is created at the root project level as well.
This means that both api and reference documentation output will now
reside in the root project's 'build' directory. This is more consistent
and easy to discover.
