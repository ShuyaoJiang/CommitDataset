Fix JDK9 build after Groovy 2.5 upgrade

After the Groovy 2.5 upgrade, the Spring Framework build on JDK9 hit
GROOVY-8631. Adding the relevant `jax-api` dependency to the module
didn't fix this issue. The Groovy release notes mention the use of the
`--add-modules` JVM flag, but this is not an option for this build which
should run on JDK8 -> JDK11.

This commit changes the dependency from `groovy-all` to more focused
dependencies on Groovy in the `spring-beans` and `spring-context`
modules. This change seems to avoid the automatic loading of Groovy
enhancements to JAXB (shipped with `groovy-xml`).
