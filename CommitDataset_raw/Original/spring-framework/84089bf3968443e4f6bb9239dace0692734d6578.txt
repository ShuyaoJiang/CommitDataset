Add HandlerProvider interface

HandlerProvider is now an interface that can be used to plug in
WebSocket handlers with per-connection scope semantics. There are two
implementations, of the interface, one simple and a second that creates
handler instances through AutowireCapableBeanFactory.

HandlerProvider also provides a destroy method that is used to
apply a destroy callback whenever a client connection closes.
