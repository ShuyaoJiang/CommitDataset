Fix issue with extracting matrix variables

The servlet spec recommends removing path parameters from the
contextPath, servletPath, and pathInfo but not from the requestURI.
This poses a challenge for the UrlPathHelper, which determines the
lookup path by comparing the above.

This change introduces a method that matches the requestURI to the
contextPath and servletPath ignoring path parameters (i.e. matrix
variables) for comparison purposes while also preserving them in the
resulting lookup path.
