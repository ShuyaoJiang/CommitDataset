Allow relative paths within resource location path

Prior to this change, location paths used for resource handling would
not allow "non-cleaned, relative paths" such as
`file://home/user/static/../static/`. When checking if the resolved
resource's path starts with the location path, a mismatch would happen
when comparing for example:

* the location `file://home/user/static/../static/`
* and the resource `file://home/user/static/resource.txt`

This commit cleans the location path before comparing it to the resource
path.
