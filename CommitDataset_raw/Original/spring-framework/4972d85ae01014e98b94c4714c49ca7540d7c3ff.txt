Create a new API for handling merged annotations

Add new `MergedAnnotations` and `MergedAnnotation` interfaces that
attempt to provide a uniform way for dealing with merged annotations.

Specifically, the new API provides alternatives for the static methods
in `AnnotationUtils` and `AnnotatedElementUtils` and supports Spring's
comprehensive annotation attribute `@AliasFor` features. The interfaces
also open the possibility of the same API being exposed from the
`AnnotationMetadata` interface.

Additional utility classes for collecting, filtering and selecting
annotations have also been added.

Typical usage for the new API would be something like:

	MergedAnnotations.from(Example.class)
		.stream(MyAnnotation.class)
		.map(a -> a.getString("value"))
		.forEach(System.out::println);
