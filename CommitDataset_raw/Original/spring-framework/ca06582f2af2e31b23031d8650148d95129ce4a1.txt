Support Jackson @JsonFilter

This commit adds a filters property to MappingJacksonValue
and also manages a special FilterProvider class name model key in
order to be able to specify a customized FilterProvider for each
handler method execution, and thus provides a more dynamic
alternative to our existing JsonView support.

A filters property is also now available in Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder
and Jackson2ObjectMapperFactoryBean in order to set easily a
global FilterProvider.
