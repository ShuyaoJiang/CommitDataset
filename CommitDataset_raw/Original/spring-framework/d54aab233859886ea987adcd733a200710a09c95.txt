Log connection URL for embedded databases

Prior to this commit, EmbeddedDatabaseFactory logged the name of an
embedded database just before it was created; however, the name alone
is not sufficient for connecting to the database via external tools
such as the H2 Web Console.

This commit updates EmbeddedDatabaseFactory to make it easier to
connect to embedded databases via external tools by logging the
complete connection URL for an embedded database as it's being created.
In addition, EmbeddedDatabaseFactory now logs when an embedded database
is being shut down.
