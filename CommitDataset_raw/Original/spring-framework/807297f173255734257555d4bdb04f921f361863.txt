Remove RxNetty (from test sources)

Practically no changes to RxNetty for a year and efforts underway to
rebuild 0.6.x based on a current Reactor Netty base.

Aside from the extra time to run integration tests having two
Netty-based servers can also cause false alarms such as ByteBuf leaks
related to RxNetty.
