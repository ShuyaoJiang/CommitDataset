LiveBeansView does not rely on application contexts order anymore

This commit makes sure that the `unregister` order of registered
application contexts has no incidence on the removal of the LiveBeansView
MBean.

Rather than using the last application context's name to compute the
identity of the MBean to remove, the identity is stored when the MBean is
created.

This commit also adds missing tests.

Issue: SPR-14848
