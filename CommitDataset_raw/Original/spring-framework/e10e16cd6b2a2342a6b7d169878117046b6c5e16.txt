Support fall-back to ASM parsing @Configuration

Update ConfigurationClassParser to fall-back to ASM parsing if standard
annotation processing fails. This change allows @Conditional annotations
that refer to missing classes to work.

This commit also introduces a new inner SourceClass object that
encapsulates the conditional logic required when reading the source
classes.
