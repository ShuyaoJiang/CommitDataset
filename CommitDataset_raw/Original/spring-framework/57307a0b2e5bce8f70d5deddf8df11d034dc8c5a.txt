Decode path vars when url decoding is turned off

When URL decoding is turned off in AbstractHandlerMapping, the
extracted path variables are also not encoded. Turning off URL decoding
may be necessary for request mapping to work correctly when the path
may contain the (encoded) special character '/'. At the same time there
is no good reason not to leave path variables encoded. This change
ensures path variables are encoded when URL decoding is turned off.
