Avoid exception while setting the status code of a committed response

Before this commit, it was not possible to set the status code of an
HTTP response without throwing an exception if it was already
committed. The consequence was a lot of errors in the logs for long
lived HTTP exchanges like Server-Sent Events for example.

After this commit, ServerHttpResponse#setStatusCode() returns
true if the operation succeeded and false if the status code has not
been set because the response has already been committed.

In term of implementation, that makes status code managed
consistently with headers and cookies:
AbstractServerHttpResponse#setStatusCode() stores the status
code that will be effectively set later in the response lifecycle by
the HTTP server via AbstractServerHttpResponse#writeStatusCode()
when the response will be committed.
