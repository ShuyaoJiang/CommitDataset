Use ArrayList instead of LinkedList for known size

Spring JDBC unlike other modules uses LinkedList instead of ArrayList
in several places. There is a large body of evidence suggesting that on
contemporary hardware ArrayList is both faster and has less overhead
than even in degenerate cases of empty lists [3] or unknown size.

There are two places in Spring JDBC where the size of the list is known
in advance and an ArrayList of the correct final size can be created
