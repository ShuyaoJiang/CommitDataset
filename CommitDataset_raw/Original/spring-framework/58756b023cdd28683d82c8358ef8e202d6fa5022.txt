Ensure cast correctly included for OpPlus compilation

When the plus operator is used between strings in a SpEL
expression and that expression is compiled, it is
important to include a cast if computation of any of
the operands isn't obviously leaving strings on the
stack. Likewise if the stack contents are known to
be strings, a cast should not be included.
