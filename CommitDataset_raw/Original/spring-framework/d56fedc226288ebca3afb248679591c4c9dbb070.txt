Methods for reading a Resource in DataBufferUtils

Currently ResourceEncoder and ResourceRegionEncoder use DataBufferUtils
to read resource with an AsynchronousFileChannel if it is a file or
otherwise fallback on getting the channel from the resource.

The same is now required in other places where a Resource needs to be
read and is also generally useful.
