Configure Kotlin plugin support for Eclipse in Gradle build

This commit configures the Kotlin plugin for Eclipse in the
spring-core-coroutines Gradle project so that users no longer have to
manually "Configure Kotlin / Add Kotlin Nature" within the Eclipse IDE
after importing projects.

This change is currently limited to the spring-core-coroutines project
since it is the only project in which Java code depends on compiled
Kotlin code; however, this change may later be applied to additional
projects if desirable.
