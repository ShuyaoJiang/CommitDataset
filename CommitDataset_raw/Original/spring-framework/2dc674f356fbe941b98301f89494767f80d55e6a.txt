Restore AbstractPropertyAccessor

Commit 3d86f15 added a lot of new feature in AbstractPropertyAccessor
shared by both DirectFieldAccessor and BeanWrapperImpl. This makes this
abstract class harder to implement for others having simpler use cases.

It turns that Spring Data has such use case; this commit split these new
features in a dedicated new base class, leaving AbstractPropertyAccessor
untouched.
