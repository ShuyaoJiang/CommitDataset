Fix path mapping issue in default servlet mode

Prior to this commit, some requests would be wrongly mapped to "/" when:

* requests ends with "//" such as "/foo/bar//"
* the DispatcherServlet is mapped as the default ("/")
* the app container sanitizes the servletPath

In those cases, the path extraction algorithm was wrongly guessing the
path of the current request.

This commit detects if the app container sanitized the servletPath for
the current request. If so, it uses a sanitized version of the
requestUri to extract the path information.

Issue: SPR-12372
