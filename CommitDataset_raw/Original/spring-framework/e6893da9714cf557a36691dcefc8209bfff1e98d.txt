Remove use of CompositeByteBuf in NettyDataBuffer

Prior to this commit, NettyDataBuffer had a optimization in
write(ByteBuf...), where it used a CompositeByteBuf to hold the original
and the parameter buffer.
Unfortunately, this procedure has nasty consequences when splicing
buffers (see https://stackoverflow.com/a/48111196/839733).

As of this commit, NettyDataBuffer stopped using CompositeByteBuf, and
 simply does ByteBuf.write().

Issue: SPR-16351
