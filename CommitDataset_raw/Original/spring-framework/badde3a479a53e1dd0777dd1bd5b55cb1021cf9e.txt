Add Kotlin based ScriptTemplateView rendering test

Kotlin JSR 223 support currently requires kotlin-script-util
dependency (jcabi-aether, maven-core and aether-api can be
excluded since they are only used for live import of
dependencies and bring a lot of JARs in the classpath) and a
/META-INF/services/javax.script.ScriptEngineFactory
file specifying the ScriptEngineFactory to use, in that case
org.jetbrains.kotlin.script.jsr223.KotlinJsr223JvmLocalScriptEngineFactory.

Issue: SPR-15059
