JettyRequestUpgradeStrategy implements Lifecycle

After this change JettyRequestUpgradeStrategy implements Lifecyle,
which is used to init and cleanup the Jetty WebSocketServerFactory.

Since a RequestUpgradeStrategy is typically created reflectively
within DefaultHandshakeHandler, the Lifecycle events are propagated
from the top, i.e. the Spring MVC HandlerMapping through the
WebSocket/SockJsHttpRequestHandler.
