Add global CORS configuration capabilities

This commit adds JavaConfig based global CORS configuration
capabilities to Spring MVC. It is now possible to specify
multiple CORS configurations, each mapped on a path pattern,
by overriding
WebMvcConfigurerAdapter#configureCrossOrigin(CrossOriginConfigurer).

It is also possible to combine global and @CrossOrigin based
CORS configuration.
