Update AbstractMBeanServerTests hierarchy to JUnit 4

This commit lays the groundwork for introducing TestGroup#JMXMP and
related assumptions in select JMX-related tests in a subsequent commit;
JUnit assumptions require JUnit 4+ to function properly, so the entire
AbstractMBeanServerTests hierarchy must be moved over to JUnit 4+ style.
