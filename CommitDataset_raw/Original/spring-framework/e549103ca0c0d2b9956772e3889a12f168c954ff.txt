Remove Jackson dependency from TransportHandler hierarchy

Prior to this change, AbstractHttpReceivingTransportHandler had a direct
dependency on a Jacckson Exception (checking that exception in a catch
clause). This can cause issues for applications that don't have that
dependency.

This commit removes that direct dependency, still logging the
appropriate log messages using a parent exception (IOException) and
reflection.

Issue: SPR-11963
