Exclude commons-logging from spring-test dependencies

Prior to this commit, various dependencies in the spring-test module
pulled in commons-logging as a transitive dependency. Consequently,
the presence of commons-logging in the generated Eclipse classpath
overrode the intended use of the spring-jcl module causing JUL to be
used instead of log4j for tests executed within Eclipse, thereby
ignoring the configuration in src/test/resources/log4j2-test.xml.

This commit addresses this issue by excluding commons-logging in
spring-test.gradle for all Selenium dependencies.

Issue: SPR-15930
