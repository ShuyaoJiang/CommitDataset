Polish AbstractServerHttpResponse

This commit simplifies the logic for applying beforeCommit actions
replacing the use of chained Mono.then calls with a single
Flux.concat.

Also renamed writeStatusCode, writeHeaders, and writeCookies to
applyStatusCode, applyHeaders, and applyCookies respectively to
better reflect we're simply setting them on the underlying response
(not necessarily written yet).
