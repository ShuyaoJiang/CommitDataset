Handle non-void write methods deterministically

This change resolves a specific issue with processing
java.math.BigDecimal via ExtendedBeanInfo. BigDecimal has a particular
constellation of #setScale methods that, prior to this change, had the
potential to cause ExtendedBeanInfo to throw an IntrospectionException
depending on the order in which the methods were processed.

Because JDK 7 no longer returns deterministic results from
Class#getDeclaredMethods, it became a genuine possibility - indeed a
statistical certainty that the 'wrong' setScale method handling order
happens sooner or later. Typically one could observe this failure once
out of every four test runs.

This commit introduces deterministic method ordering of all discovered
non-void returning write methods in such a way that solves the problem
for BigDecimal as well as for any other class having a similar method
arrangement.

Also:

 - Remove unnecessary cast

 - Pass no method information to PropertyDescriptor superclasses when
   invoking super(...). This ensures that any 'type mismatch'
   IntrospectionExceptions are handled locally in ExtendedBeanInfo and
   its Simple* PropertyDescriptor variants where we have full control.
