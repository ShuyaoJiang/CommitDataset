Update the Jetty WebSocket adapter

This changes switches from using Jetty's WebSocketListener interface
to use Jetty's @WebSocket annotations instead. The change should be
transparent but the annnotations provide a little more controler
including handling pong frames.

This change also introduces a WebSocketMessage interface.
