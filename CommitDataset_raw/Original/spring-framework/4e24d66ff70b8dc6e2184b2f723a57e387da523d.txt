Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder now allows to create ObjectMapper and XmlMapper
instances easily thanks to its fluent API.

This builder is used in Jackson message converters and views to instantiate default
ObjectMapper and XmlMapper.

Jackson2ObjectMapperFactoryBean in order to allow to create easily a XmlMapper
instance.
