SPR-16936 Fix PathVariable javadoc

@PathVariable's javadoc states that it supports MultiValueMap
parameters (introduced by commit df0902), but by reading through the
code, that does not seem to be the case (compare, e.g.,
PathVariableMapMethodArgumentResolver to
RequestParamMapMethodArgumentResolver).

Moreover, parsing MultipleValueMap is done according to the ";"
character, and placing such a character in a path (e.g., consider
something like "/app/{param}/show" would just break the path.

This patch fixes PathVariable's javadoc by removing the mention of
MultiValueMap.
