Fix PathPattern comparator result for wildcard suffix usage

Without this change the comparator thinks "/{foo}"
is more specific than "/{foo}.*". The minimal fix here
to address it is to copy what the AntPathMatcher
comparator does which is to consider '.*' as *not*
a usage of a wildcard. See PatternInfo#initCounters()
for the AntPathMatcher handling of this.

This change ensures the PathPattern comparator now produces
the expected result but suffix usage in general needs more
thought at some point.
