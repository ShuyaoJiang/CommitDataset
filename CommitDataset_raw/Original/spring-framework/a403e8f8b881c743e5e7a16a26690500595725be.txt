Inject @Configuration BeanFactory before autowire

Add EnhancedConfigurationBeanPostProcessor to inject the BeanFactory
into EnhancedConfiguration classes before the
AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.postProcessPropertyValues method
is called.

Prior to this commit it was possible for @Autowire in a @Configuration
class to invoke an enhanced configuration class method before the
BeanFactory was injected. This is due to the fact that the
AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor was called before
AbstractAutowireCapableBeanFactory.invokeAwareMethods().
