Do not process conditional requests for non-GET

Prior to this commit, HttpEntityMethodProcessor would process
conditional requests even if those aren't GET requests.
This is an issue for POST requests with "If-None-Match: *" headers and
many other use cases, which should not receive an HTTP 304 Not Modified
status in response.

This commit only triggers ETag/Last-Modified conditional requests bits
for GET requests.

Issue: SPR-13496
