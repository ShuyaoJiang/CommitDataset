Specify SockJS protocol and client supported versions

In order to avoid breaking changed due to the upcoming SockJS 1.0
release (see SPR-12422 for more details) and link to the right
SockJS documentation version, we now explicitly specify that we
support SockJS protocol 0.3.3 and SockJS client 0.3.x.
