Document "present" terminology in AnnotationUtils

Prior to this commit, the documentation in AnnotationUtils was
inconsistent, and at times even misleading, with regard to finding
annotations that are "present" or "directly present" on annotated
elements.

This commit defines the terminology used within AnnotationUtils and
introduces the explicit notion of "meta-present" to denote that
annotations are present within annotation hierarchies above annotated
elements.
