Improve allowNullValue handling when a null value is provided

This commit improves `AbstractValueAdaptingCache` to throw a dedicated
exception if `allowNullValues` is `false` and a `null` value is provided
anyway. This avoid a lower-level exception from the cache library that
will miss some context.
