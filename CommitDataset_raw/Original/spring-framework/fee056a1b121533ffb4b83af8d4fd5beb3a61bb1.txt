Simplify search algorithms in AnnotatedElementUtils

This commit introduces a boolean alwaysProcesses() method in the
Processor API which allows for simplification across all search
algorithms within AnnotatedElementUtils.

Specifically, it is no longer necessary for process() methods to verify
that the supplied annotation is actually the sought target annotation.

In addition, duplicated code has been extracted into common methods
(e.g., hasMetaAnnotationTypes()) and common Processor implementations
(e.g., AlwaysTrueBooleanAnnotationProcessor).
