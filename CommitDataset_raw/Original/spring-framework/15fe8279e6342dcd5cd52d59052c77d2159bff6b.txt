Reset Expires HTTP header when caching configured

Just like SPR-13252 addressed this issue for the "Pragma" header, this
issue resets the HTTP 1.0 "Expires" header.
When such a header has been set (by a filter, for example) and HTTP
caching has been configured at the WebContentGenerator, this header
value is reset to "". In this case, "Cache-Control" and "Expires" might
have inconsistent values and we consider that the HTTP caching
configuration should take precedence.

Depending on the servlet container chosen to deploy the application,
this might result in empty "" header values or no header set at all.

Issue: SPR-14053
