Fix RegexPathElement when matching variables against a root path

The first fix for issue 15264 covered the case of using a single
variable (the case mentioned in the bug report). However, when
more than one variable is used a different PathElement is built.
This RegexPathElement needs a similar change that checks the
path includes data to bind.

Issue: SPR-15264
