Add check for unused WebSocket sessions

Sessions connected to a STOMP endpoint are expected to receive some
client messages. Having received none after successfully connecting
could be an indication of proxy or network issue. This change adds
periodic checks to see if we have not received any messages on a
session which is an indication the session isn't going anywhere
most likely due to a proxy issue (or unreliable network) and close
those sessions.
