Fix assumption about file-based Resources in PropertiesLoaderSupport (SPR-7547)

When using PropertiesLoaderSupport implementations (principally
PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer), an assumption was made that any
Resource representing a set of properties must be file-based.  SPR-7547
exposed the fact that if a non-file-based Resource implementation such
as ByteArrayResource were passed in, an IllegalStateException would be thrown
from the AbstractResource base class' implementation of getFilename().

This is now patched, and PropertiesLoaderSupport implementations treat
Resource implementations equally, regardless of file-orientation.
