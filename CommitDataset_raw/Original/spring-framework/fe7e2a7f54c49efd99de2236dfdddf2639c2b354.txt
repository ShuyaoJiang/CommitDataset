Improvements to the way the content of RequestConditions is exposed.

RequestCondition types keep individual expression types (e.g. the
discrete header or param expressions) package private. Although the 
implementation of these types should remain private, there is no 
reason not to provide access to the underlying expression data --
e.g. for creating a REST endpoint documentation tool, or if you 
want to know which of the "consumes"/"produces" media types
are negated.

This change ensures that all RequestCondition types have a public
getter that makes available the basic expression data.
