Clarify the use of @Cacheable in PostConstruct code

Update documentation to explicitly mention that the cache interceptor
must be fully initialized to provide the expected behavior and therefore
initialization code should not rely on this feature, i;e. typically in
PostConstruct callback.

Since the Transactional infrastructure has the exact same infrastructure,
update that section of the doc as well.
