WebFlux and Integration share webflux-client.adoc

Extract WebClient content into a separate file that is now included
both in the WebFlux and in the Integration sections.

This allows having RestTemplate and WebClient documented in one place
under Integration while also keeping the same included in the WebFlux
section too.
