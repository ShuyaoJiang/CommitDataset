Initialize ResourceUrlProvider only once

Prior to this change, the ResourceUrlProvider would listen to
ContextRefreshedEvents and autodetect resource handlers each time. This
can cause issues when multiple contexts are involved and the last one
has no resource handler, thus clearing the previously detected ones.

This commit disables resource handlers auto-detection once some have
been detected with a refreshed context.

Issue: SPR-12592
