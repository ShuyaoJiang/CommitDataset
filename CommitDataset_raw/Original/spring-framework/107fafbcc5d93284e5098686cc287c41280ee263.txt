Do not consider bridge methods in SpEL properties

Modify ReflectivePropertyAccessor so that it no longer considers
bridge methods when finding getters or setters. This should help
to prevent subtle errors that can occur when particular JDK
implementations happen to return bridge methods before non-bridge
methods when calling Class.getMethods()
