Fix annotation search ending too early

In AnnotationUtils#findAnnotation(Method, Class), the search for a
method annotation fails if:

 - the original method does not have the annotation

 - an abstract superclass does not have an equivalent method declared

 - an interface implemented by the superclass has the method and
   the annotation -> this should be found, but is not!

This happens because the try-catch block in #findAnnotation is too wide:
cl.getDeclaredMethod() can throw NoSuchMethodException and skip the
'#searchOnInterfaces' call prematurely.

The try-catch block was made narrower to allow #searchOnInterfaces to
be called even if the abstract class does not have the method declared
at all.
