Rename ResolvedResource to HttpResource

`ResolvedResource` is a rather generic name - changing the extended
interface to something more meaningful: `HttpResource`.
For now, implementations are linked with the resource handling chain,
but this aspect has been removed from the interface documentation.

Issue: SPR-14264
