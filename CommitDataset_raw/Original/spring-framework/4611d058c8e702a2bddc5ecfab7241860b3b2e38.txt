Support Forwarded-Header in UriComponentsBuilder

This commit introduces support for RFC 7239: Forwarded HTTP Extension in
the UriComponentsBuilder. Unfortunately, RFC 7239 is not a complete
replacement for the X-Forwarded-* headers: specifically, there is not
direct replacement for X-Forwarded-Port. The JIRA contains more
information.

Issue: SPR-11856
