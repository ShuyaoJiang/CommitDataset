ResourceWebHandler uses MediaTypeFactory directly

There is no need for ResourceWebHandler to go through the
PathExtensionContentTypeResolver when MediaTypeFactory makes it easy to
perform such lookups for a given Resource.

This does not support any extensions explicitly registered through a
WebFluxConfigurer but it would be easy enough to pass those into
ResourceWebHandler as a simple Map<String, MediaType>, should the need
arise.
