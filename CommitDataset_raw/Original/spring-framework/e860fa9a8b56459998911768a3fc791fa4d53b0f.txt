Move feed message converters ahead of jackson/jaxb2

The Atom/RSS message converters are now registered ahead of the
Jackson and the JAXB2 message converters by default. Since the Atom
and RSS converters convert to and from very specific object types
Feed and Channel respectively, that shouldn't introduce any regressions
and will work more intuitively when the requested media type is "*/*".
