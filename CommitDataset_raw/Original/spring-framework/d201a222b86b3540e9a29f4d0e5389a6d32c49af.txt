Avoid locking in WebSocket session "close" callback

When processing a "close" notification from the server make an effort
to cancel any outstanding heartbeat but avoid going as far as acquiring
the responseLock since the server itself may already hold a lock of its
own leading to a potential deadlock.

The heartbeat task is now also further protected with an isClosed()
check in case the heartbeat does not get cancelled in a concurrent
scenario.
