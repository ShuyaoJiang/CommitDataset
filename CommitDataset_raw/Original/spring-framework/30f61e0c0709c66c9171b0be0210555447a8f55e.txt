Add body(Object) method to ServerResponse.BodyBuilder

This method introduces a new body(Object) to ServerResponse, a shortcut
to body(BodyInserters.fromObject(Object)).

Note that in the implementation of the method, an `instanceof` check is
performed to make sure that the passed argument is not a `Publisher`,
as users should call `body(Publisher, Class)` for sending a reactive
type.

This Publisher-check is also done in the `WebClient`, for the same
reasons.
