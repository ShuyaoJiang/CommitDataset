Migrate and verify annotation utility methods

Migrate all possible `AnnotationUtils` and `AnnotatedElementUtils`
method to the `MergedAnnotation` API, verify results against the old
implementations.

All migrated methods now call both the new API and the old version and
ensure that the same results or exceptions are raised. A full build of
both Spring Framework and Spring Boot has been executed to ensure, as
much as possible, that the migration does not cause unexpected
regressions.
