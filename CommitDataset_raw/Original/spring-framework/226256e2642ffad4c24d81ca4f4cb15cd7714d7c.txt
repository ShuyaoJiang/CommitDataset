Respect <description> within <entry> per beans XSD

Prior to this change, a parsing exception would be thrown if a
<description> element was placed within a <map><entry/></map>
element. The beans XSD has always permitted this arrangement,
but BeanDefinitionParserDelegate did not respect it. The latter now
simply ignores any <description> element, rather than failing.

Issue: SPR-8563
