CONTRIBUTING is markdwon again + polish README

The main way CONTRIBUTING will be viewed is on Github and the output
is just not good enough to justify using asciidoctor vs md/txt as
the recommended on the Github help page for contributing guidelines.

For example it was attractive to use a TOC and that works on Github
but doesn't look good. In the end it's a very short TOC and
maintaining manually is easy enough and it's easier to control the
look.
