Refactor AnnotationUtils#findAllAnnotationAttributes

Remove all convenience variants of #findAllAnnotationAttributes and
refactor the remaining method to accept a MetadataReaderFactory
instead of creating its own SimpleMetadataReaderFactory internally.
This allows clients to use non-default class loaders as well as
customize the particular MetadataReaderFactory to be used (e.g.
'simple' vs 'caching', etc).
