Jackson2JsonTokenizer unwraps top level array only

When the input stream is a JSON array the tokenizer skips over the
start and end array tokens in order to decode into an array of
top-level objects. However in this mode it also skips over nested
start and end array tokens which prevents proper parsing of JSR-310
dates (represented with an array syntax) as well as any fields that
are collections.

Issue: SPR-15803
