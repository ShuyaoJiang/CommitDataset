Handle invalid STOMP content-length header value

After this change if a content-length header is provided but is less
than 0 or cannot be parsed as a number, it is ignored and the body
is read sequentially, i.e. until we reach a null byte terminator.

This provides better protection against clients that may set the
content-length header in error.
