Use ConcurrentHashMaps in DefaultContextCache

The changes made in 0cb22fc8f34a29c42313056671a947444b60050b would
result in contexts not being properly closed if evicted from the
ConcurrentReferenceHashMap by the Garbage Collector.

This commit reverts those changes and returns to using standard
ConcurrentHashMaps for the time being.
