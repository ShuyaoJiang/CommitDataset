Upgrade to Kotlin 1.1-M04

Needed for Kotlin script and JSR 223 support, and a good target
for Spring Framework 5.0 since it will allow features like generating
Java 8 bytecode, JDK 9 support, annotation array attribute single
value without arrayOf(), etc.

We ensure Kotlin 1.0 compatibility by setting apiVersion and
languageVersion compiler options to 1.0.

Issue: SPR-15059
