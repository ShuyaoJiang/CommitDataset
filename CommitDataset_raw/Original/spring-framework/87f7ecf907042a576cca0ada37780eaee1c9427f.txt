Refactor merge-artifacts script to a plugin

Refactor the existing merge-artifacts script to a full Gradle plugin.
The new plugin uses a 'merge' extension in favor of Gradle 'ext'
configuration and can be applied to all projects in a multi-module
build.

Any project that defines a 'merge.into' project will now implicitly
receive a dependency to that project. Furthermore other projects
with a dependency on 'merge.into' will receive a direct project
link within the IDE. For example: 'spring-webmvc-tiles3'
is merged into 'spring-webmvc' and 'spring-test-mvc' depends
on 'spring-webmvc'. Within the IDE 'spring-test-mvc' will show
dependencies to both 'spring-webmvc' and 'spring-webmvc-tiles'.
