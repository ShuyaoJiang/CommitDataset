Add StompCodec

Previously, the broker relay's TCP client used Reactor's built in
delimited codec as part of its parsing of STOMP frames. \0 was used as
the delimiter. This worked for most STOMP frames but, crucially,
not for frames with a body that contained \0: when such a frame was
received it would be truncated.

This commit adds a custom codec that parses STOMP frames more
intelligently. It honours the content-length header allowing it to
correctly parse frames with a body that contains \0. The codec largely
delegates to two new classes: StompEncoder and StompDecoder. For
consistency, code that previously used StompMessageConverter has been
reworked to use these new encoder and decoder classes.
