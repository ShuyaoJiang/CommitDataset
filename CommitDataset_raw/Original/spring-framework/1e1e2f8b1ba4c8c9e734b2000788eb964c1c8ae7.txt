Support HttpEntity method arguments

The RequestBodyArgumentResolver has been refactored to have a shared
base class and tests with the new HttpEntityMethodArgumentResolver.

An HttpEntity argument is not expected to have an async wrapper because
the request headers are available immediately. The body however can be
asynchronous, e.g. HttpEntity<Flux<String>>.
