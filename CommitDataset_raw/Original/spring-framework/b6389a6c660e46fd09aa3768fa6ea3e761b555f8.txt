Jms request/reply operations

This commit updates JmsMessagingTemplate to support the
MessageRequestReplyOperation interface that provides synchronous
request/reply operations.

As JmsMessagingTemplate delegates everything under the scenes to
JmsTemplate, the latter has been updated as well to offer such lower
level operation.

Issue: SPR-12037
