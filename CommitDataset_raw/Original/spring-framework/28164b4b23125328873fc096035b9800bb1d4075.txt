Introduced "jsonPrefix" bean property

This change involves a modification of the "writeContent" template method to include the "jsonPrefix" String instead of the "prefixJson" boolean flag. Since said template method has only been introduced in 3.2.2, this change should hopefully not be a problem.

Issue: SPR-10567
