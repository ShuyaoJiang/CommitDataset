Improve ex msg when locations & classes are declared in test hierarchy

Prior to this commit, if both locations and classes were declared via
@ContextConfiguration at differing levels in a test class hierarchy,
the exception message stated that neither of the default context
loaders was able to load an ApplicationContext from the merged context
configuration, but the message didn't explain why.

This commit adds an explicit check for such scenarios and provides a
more informative exception message similar to the following:

"Neither X nor Y supports loading an ApplicationContext from
[MergedContextConfiguration ...]: declare either 'locations' or
'classes' but not both."

Issue: SPR-12060
