Add beforeConcurrentHandling support

Previously CallableProcessingInterceptor and
DeferredResultProcessingInterceptor did not have support for capturing
the state of the original Thread just prior to processing. This made it
difficult to transfer the state of one Thread (i.e. ThreadLocal) to the
Thread used to process the Callable.

This commit adds a new method to CallableProcessingInterceptor and
DeferredResultProcessingInterceptor named beforeConcurrentHandling
which will be invoked on the original Thread used to submit the Callable
or DeferredResult. This means the state of the original Thread can be
captured in beforeConcurrentHandling and transfered to the new Thread
in preProcess.
