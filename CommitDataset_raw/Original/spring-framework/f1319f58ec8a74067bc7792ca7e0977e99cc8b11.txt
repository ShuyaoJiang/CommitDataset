Introduce new functional web API

This commit introduces a new, functional web programming model in the
org.springframework.web.reactive.function package. The key types
are:

 - Request and Response are new Java 8-DSLs for access to the HTTP
   request and response
 - HandlerFunction represents a function to handle a request to a
   response
 - RoutingFunction maps a request to a HandlerFunction
 - FilterFunction filters a routing as defined by a RoutingFunction
 - RequestPredicate is used by Router to create RoutingFunctions
 - RequestPredicates offers common RequestPredicate instances
