Remove redundant @Aspect from CodeStyleAspect.aj

This has been present for quite some time, and compilation at the
command line was never a problem.  However, after upgrading to
STS 2.3.3.M2, errors started appearing in the Problems tab about
'duplicate @Aspect annotations'.  This message was a bit misleading
given that the underlying issue is that applying an @Aspect annotation
on an aspect declared in .aj style is redundant.  Andy Clement is
investigating as well, but for now the reason for the change in behavior
remains a mystery.
