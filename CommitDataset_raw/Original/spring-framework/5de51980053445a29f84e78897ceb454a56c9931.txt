Allow greater flexibility for template method createDataBinderFactory

Prior to this commit, the template method createDataBinderFactory
would only allow ServletRequestDataBinderFactory as a return type.

This commit updates the method signature and allows
InitBinderDataBinderFactory, a superclass of the previous one.
Then other implementations can override this method and return
other InitBinderDataBinderFactory types.
