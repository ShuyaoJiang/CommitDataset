Restore sleep interval between recovery attempt

Commit 6a04831 introduced a regression that lead to burst recovery
attempts when the broker is up but the listener is failing for some
reason (the most obvious one being that the destination does not
exist).

Since the sleep period between recovery attempts strategy is more
complex, we can't just sleep for a period of time. But we can create
an execution and apply it once which should work just fine for most
use cases.
