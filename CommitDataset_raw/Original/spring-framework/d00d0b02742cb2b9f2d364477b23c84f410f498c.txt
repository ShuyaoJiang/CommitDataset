Clean up spring-web tests warnings

Clean up compiler warnings in the tests of spring-web. This commit
adds type parameters to all the types (mostly `List` and `Map`).

After this commit the only warnings in spring-web left are in
* `MockExpressionEvaluator` this can't be fixed until JSP-EL is fixed
* `Jackson2ObjectMapperFactoryBeanTests#testSetModules` that code
   would never compile with generics.
