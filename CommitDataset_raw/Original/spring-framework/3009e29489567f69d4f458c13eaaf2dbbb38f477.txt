Remove contentDispositionFormData with charset method

The method was orginally added under SPR-14547 but the example in it
was probably intended for use with Content-Disposition server response
header (file dowonload) and not for a Content-Disposition header
within the body of a multipart request.

In a Spring application a multipart request is typically serialized
by the FormHttpMessageConverter and hence the Content-Disposition is
not explicitly set by the application.

Issue: SPR-15205
