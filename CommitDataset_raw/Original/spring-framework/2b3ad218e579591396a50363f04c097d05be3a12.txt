Clarify RequestMappingHandlerAdapter javadoc

This commit updates the javadoc of
`RequestMappingHanderAdapter.setCacheSecondsForSessionAttributeHandlers`
to explain how one can disable that feature and prevent "Cache-Control"
directives from being added when `@SessionAttributes` annotations are
used on Controllers.

Issue: SPR-13598
