Fix GenericConversionService search algorithm

Previously the algorithm used by GenericConversionService to find
converters incorrectly searched for interfaces working up from the
base class. This caused particular problems with custom List
converters as as the Collection interface would be considered before
the List interface giving CollectionToObjectConverter precedence
over the custom converter.

The updated algorithm restores the class search order to behave in the
same way as Spring 3.1.
