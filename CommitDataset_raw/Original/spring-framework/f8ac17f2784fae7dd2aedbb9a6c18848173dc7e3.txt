Polishing

Two changes to web.reactive.function:

 - Changed Response.stream method to allow for specific Publisher types
 to be returned in Response.

 - Router now stores HttpMessageReader|Writer retrieved from
 Configuration in the attributes as supplier, not as stream, to allow
 for multiple reads.
