Optimize memory usage in factory *Metadata classes

InjectionMetadata and LifecycleMetadata can end up having mostly empty
instance variables. In such cases memory usage can be improved a little
bit.

This patch addresses this in two ways:

 - Creating a LinkedHashSet of the "right" size, the default capacity
   is 16 but the exact capacity needed is known in advance.

 - If the argument is empty then use Collections#emptySet which is a
   constant so no additional memory is used. Since it's immutable there
   is no need for the Collections#synchronizedSet wrapper.

Issue: SPR-9264
