Fix issue with creating ServletRequestAttributes

Prevously the FrameworkServlet created a new ServletRequestAttributes
instance for every request, unless the RequestContextHolder already
contained an instance whose type is not ServletRequestAttributes.
The main intent was that if RequestContextHolder contains a
PortletRequestAttributes, it should be left in place.

This change does an "instanceof" check against the request in
RequestContextHolder instead of an "equals" check on the type.
It still leaves PortletRequestAttributes in place but also allows
the previous request to be any sub-class of ServletRequestAttributes.

Issue: SPR-10025
