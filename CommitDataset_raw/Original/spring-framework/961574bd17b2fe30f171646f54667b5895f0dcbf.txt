Fix regression in determineTransactionManager

One more (and hopefully last) attempt at making sure
determineTransactionManager does not break existing use cases.

This commit prevents any lookup if no transaction attributes are set
which is more compliant with the original version and prevents a lookup
if a non existing bean name is provided explicitly (as it can be the case
with Spring Boot).

Issue: SPR-12541
