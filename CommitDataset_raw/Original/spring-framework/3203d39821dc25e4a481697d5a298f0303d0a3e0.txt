Remove Content-Length response header from errors

Prior to this commit, when errors happened before the response was
committed, the `Content-Length` response header would be left as is.
This can be problematic since the error can be handled later in the
chain and the response body changed accordingly. For example, Spring
Boot renders error pages in those cases. If the `Content-Length` is set,
HTTP clients can get confused and only consider part of the error
response body.

This commit ensures that any `Content-Length` response header is removed
in case of errors, if the response is not already committed.

This is done at the `AbstractServerHttpResponse` level, since errors can
be handled in multiple places and the response itself is the safest
place to handle this case.

As a consequence, this commit also removes `Content-Length` checks in
`EncoderHttpMessageWriter` since we now consider that we should rely on
the response body we're about to write rather than any previously set
value.

Issue: SPR-17502
