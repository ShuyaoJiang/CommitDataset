Introduce AnnotationConfigWAC #scan and #register

Primarily for use in conjunction with ApplicationContextInitializer,
these new #scan and #register methods mirror those in
AnnotationConfigApplicationContext. #setConfigLocation
and #setConfigLocations methods remain for compatibility with
ContextLoader-style initialization, but have been locally overridden
and documented clearly.

AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext#loadBeanDefinitions Javadoc has
also been updated to explain the processing logic for each of these
potential inputs.
