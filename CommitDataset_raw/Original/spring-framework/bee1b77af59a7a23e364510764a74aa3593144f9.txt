Manage asynchronous EventListener with replies

This commit makes sure to reject an `@EventListener` annotated method
that also uses `@Async`. In such scenario, the method is invoked in a
separate thread and the infrastructure has no handle on the actual reply,
if any.

The documentation has been improved to refer to that scenario.

Issue: SPR-14113
