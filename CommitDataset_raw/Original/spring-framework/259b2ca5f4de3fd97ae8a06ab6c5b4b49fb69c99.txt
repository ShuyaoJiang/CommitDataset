Added tests for errors in the source stream

This commit adds decoder/message-reader tests for errors in
the source data buffer publisher. Because the tests extend
AbstractDataBufferAllocatingTestCase, they also check whether
the buffers that precede the error in the stream are properly
released.

Issue: SPR-17025
