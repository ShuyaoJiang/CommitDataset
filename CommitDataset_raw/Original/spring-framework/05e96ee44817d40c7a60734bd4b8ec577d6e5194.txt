Cache provider related exceptions handling

This commit adds the necessary infrastructure to handle exceptions
thrown by a cache provider in both Spring's and JCache's caching
abstractions.

Both interceptors can be configured with a CacheErrorHandler that
defines several callbacks on typical cache operations. In particular,
handleCacheGetError can be implemented in such a way that an
exception thrown by the provider is handled as a cache miss by the
caching abstraction.

The handler can be configured with both CachingConfigurer and the
XML namespace (error-handler property)

Issue: SPR-9275
