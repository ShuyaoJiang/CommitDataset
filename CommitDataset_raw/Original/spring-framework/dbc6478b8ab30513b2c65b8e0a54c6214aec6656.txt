Refactor HTTP Cookie support

There is now an HttpCookie (simple name-value pair) and separately a
ServerHttpCookie sub-class with additional attributes that a server
can send to clients.

HttpHeaders is no longer the place to access cookies. Instead there is
a read-only HttpCookie map on ServerHttpRequest and a mutable
ServerHttpCookie map on ServerHttpResponse.

Cookies are stored in a map that preserves their order.
