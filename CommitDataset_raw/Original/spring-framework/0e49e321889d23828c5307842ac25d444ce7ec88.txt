Handle parameters of Kotlin extension methods correctly

The EXTENSION_RECEIVER parameter of Kotlin's extension
methods appear as normal method parameters to Java and
thus require a name. The synthetic name "$receiver" is
used here, as it is not a valid Kotlin identifier,
but valid in Java.

Issue: SPR-16119
