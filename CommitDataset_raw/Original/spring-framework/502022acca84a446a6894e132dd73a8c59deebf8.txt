Delete test annotations in spring-orm

This commit deletes all test annotations from the spring-orm module in
order to reduce unnecessary confusion between these "copies" and the
real, current versions of such classes in the spring-test module.

Furthermore, the legacy abstract JUnit 3.8 base classes and test cases
have been refactored accordingly.
