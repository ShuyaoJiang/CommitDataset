Restore sub-section headings in web content

Headings are optimized for how they appear in the left-hand side
navitation menu, with context provided by parent headings, and not
necessarily for how they read on their own.

At 2nd and 3rd level of nesting, which is where most headings are,
the wrapping becomes too distracting and the left-hand side navigation
sprawling.
