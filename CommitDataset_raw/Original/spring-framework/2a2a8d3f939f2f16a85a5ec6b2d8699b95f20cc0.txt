Allow null values to be cached with `@CacheResult`

Even though the JSR-107 spec forbids to store null values, our cache
abstraction allows that behaviour with a special handled (and this is
the default behaviour).

While this was working fine with our own set of annotations, the
JSR-107 interceptor counterpart was interpreting the spec sensu strictu.

We now allow for that special case as well.

Issue: SPR-13641
