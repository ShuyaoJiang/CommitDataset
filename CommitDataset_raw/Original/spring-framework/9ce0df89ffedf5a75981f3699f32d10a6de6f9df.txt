Support Class meta-annotation attributes with ASM

Prior to this commit, AnnotationAttributesReadingVisitor treated Class
annotation attributes as Strings instead of Classes. As a result,
look-ups for Class attributes in meta-annotations failed with an
IllegalArgumentException.

This commit fixes this issue by consistently treating Class attributes
as Classes in AnnotationAttributesReadingVisitor.

Issue: SPR-11557
