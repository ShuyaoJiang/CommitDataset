Rename ServerResponse.BodyBuilder.body to syncBody

This commit renames the `body(Object)` on ServerResponse to
`syncBody(Object)`. The reason for this is that the original method
name clashed with the `body(Publisher)` method in the Kotlin extension.

The new name nicely reflects the synchronous nature of the method,
 making it less appealing than the `Publisher`-based `body` method.
