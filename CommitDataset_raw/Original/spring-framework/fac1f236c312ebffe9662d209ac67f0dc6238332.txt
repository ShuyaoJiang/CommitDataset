Upgrade to Servlet API 4.0 for MVC and merge EhCache 3 tests into spring-context-support

Includes general streamlining of dependency declarations with reduced version variables, direct use of EclipseLink 2.7 and its implicit JPA 2.2 dependency in spring-orm, mixed use of Hibernate 5.2.10 and 5.1.10 for integration tests, as well as an upgrade to Jetty 9.4.7 RC0 and a downgrade to Groovy 2.4.12 (since Groovy 2.5 won't be final in time for Spring Framework 5.0).
