Favor local, composed annotations in the TCF

Prior to this commit, AnnotationAttributes retrieved from
MetaAnnotationUtils's AnnotationDescriptor could contain attributes
from the wrong annotation if an inherited annotation shadowed a locally
declared composed annotation.

This commit addresses this issue by invoking the new
getAnnotationAttributes() method in AnnotatedElementUtils that provides
a flag to control whether superclasses should be searched -- which
coincidentally processes local annotations before searching the class
hierarchy.
