Allow 'arg-type' matches against element body

Allow the body of 'arg-type' XML elements to be used as an alternative to
'match' attribute when defining a 'replace-method' in XML configuration.

This change has been introduced primarily to support the samples printed
in the Apress 'Pro Spring' book.
