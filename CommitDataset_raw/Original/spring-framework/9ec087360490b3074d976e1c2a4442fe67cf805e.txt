MockWebResponseBuilder defaults cookie domain

Previously MockWebResponseBuilder would use the cookie domain of the cookie
received from MockMvc response. This caused problems because the cookie
domain can be null, but HtmlUnit forbids a null domain.

This commit defaults the domain of the cookie to the domain of the
WebRequest.
