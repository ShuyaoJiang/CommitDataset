Report offending class in SpringFactoriesLoader in exception message

Prior to this commit, the exception message generated by
instantiateFactory() in SpringFactoriesLoader did not report the
offending class in the top-level exception message. The offending class
was in fact included in the message of the nested exception, but the
top-level exception message on its own was a bit misleading.

This commit improves the diagnostics for such failures by including the
offending class and the target factory type in the top-level exception
message.

Closes gh-22453
