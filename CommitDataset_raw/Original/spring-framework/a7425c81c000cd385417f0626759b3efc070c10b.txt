Add dependency on opendmk_jmxremote_optional_jar for performance builds

Although the jmxremote_optional JAR has been added to the build agents
on the Bamboo CI server for the latest JDK 8 installation, that
solution is brittle since it has to be manually installed in every new
JDK installation. In addition, this approach will not work with JDK 9+
since the "Extension Mechanism" has been removed beginning with JDK 9.

This commit addresses this issue by adding the following dependency to
spring-context.

// Substitute for "javax.management:jmxremote_optional:1.0.1_04" which
// is not available on Maven Central
testRuntime("org.glassfish.external:opendmk_jmxremote_optional_jar:1.0-b01-ea")

With this change, the Spring PERFORMANCE builds now execute on JDK 8,
9, and 11.
