Compensate for Eclipse vs Sun compiler discrepancy

Eclipse allows autoboxing on type inference; Sun javac does not. This
means that variables assigned from calls to
AnnotationAttributes#getNumber should consistently use object wrappers
as opposed to number primitives. There was only one such instance
anyway, and has now been updated accordingly.
