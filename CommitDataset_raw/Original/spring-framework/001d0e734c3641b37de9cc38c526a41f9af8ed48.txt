Support for @Order at the bean declaration level

This commit introduces OrderProvider and OrderProviderComparator, two
interfaces designed to externalize how a collection of element is sorted
according to their order value.

FactoryAwareOrderProvider is an OrderProvider implementation that knows
about the objects to order and the corresponding BeanFactory instance.
This allows to retrieve additional metadata about the actual instances
to sort, such as its factory method.

A @Bean method can now holds an additional @Order to define the order
value that this bean should have when injected as part of a collection
or array.
