Refactor View contract

View now returns Mono<Void> rather than Flux<DataBuffer> which aligns
more closely with the reactive HttpMessageConverter vs the Encoder.

The change was prompted by the upcoming implementation of a View that
delegates to an existing HttpMessageConverter e.g. for JSON, XML.

The resulting change also brings the reactive View closer in spirit to
the View from spring-webmvc which returns void.
