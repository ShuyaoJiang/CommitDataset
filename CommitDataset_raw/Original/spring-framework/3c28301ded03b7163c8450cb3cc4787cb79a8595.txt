Provide common cache config

Prior to this commit, common cache operation settings had to be
repeated for every operation: cache name(s), custom cache manager
and custom key manager.

This commit introduces the @CacheConfig annotation to bet set at
class-level (either directly or as a meta-annotation). As the cache
name(s) can be rationalized there, the "value" of the various
annotations are no longer mandatory.

CacheAnnotationParser has an API breakage to be able to retrieve
information at class-level.
