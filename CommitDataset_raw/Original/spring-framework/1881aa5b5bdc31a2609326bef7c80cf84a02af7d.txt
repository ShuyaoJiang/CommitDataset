Change default appcache manifest file extension

This commit changes the default file extension configured with
`AppCacheManifestTranformer`. This ResourceTransformer was previously
considering `.manifest` files by default, but this has been changed in
the official spec to `appcache`, in order not to clash with Microsoft's
unregistered application/manifest type.

Issue: SPR-14687
