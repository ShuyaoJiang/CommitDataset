Fix locale parsing error with en_en, tr_tr, etc

Previously, StringUtils#parseLocaleString would parse locale strings
having the same lowercase token for both language and country
incorrectly, e.g. 'tr_tr' would parse to 'tr_TR_tr' as opposed to the
expected 'tr_TR'.

This commit fixes this behavior by using using String#lastIndexOf
instead of String#indexOf when determining the location of the country
code token.
