Log and handle unresolved exceptions

Before this change use of ExceptionHandlingWebHandler did ensure no
error signals are allowed to escape (hence relying on runtime
behavior).

This change ensures the same is done even when
ExceptionHandlingWebHandler is not configured for use, at the lowest
level which is the WebToHttpHandlerAdapter.
