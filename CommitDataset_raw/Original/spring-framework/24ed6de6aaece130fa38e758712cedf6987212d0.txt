Add backslash escape support to containsSqlScriptDelimiters

Prior to this commit, ScriptUtils supported MySQL-style escapes ('\\')
when splitting a script into statements; however, MySQL-style escapes
were not supported when determining if a given script contained a
specified statement delimiter. This caused executeSqlScript() to
erroneously fallback to a newline as the statement separator in such
cases.

This commit fixes this issue by implementing the same check for
MySQL-style escapes in containsSqlScriptDelimiters() that was already
present in splitSqlScript().

Issue: SPR-17120
