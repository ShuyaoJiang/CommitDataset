Add Spring Framework integration with Tiles 3

Tiles 3 has modified packages and classes as well as additional
dependencies, notably "tiles-request-api", which is a request/response
abstraction independent of Servlet and JSP APIs.

In order to have both Tiles 2 and Tiles 3 integrations, the source for
the Tiles 3 integration is in a separate project spring-webmvc-tiles3.
The build process merges the compiled Tiles 3 integration classes into
the spring-webmvc module so in effect it contains both the Tiles 2 and
the Tiles 3 integrations.
