Fix package cycle in @EnableSpringConfigured

@EnableSpringConfigured and its @Import'ed
SpringConfiguredConfiguration @Configuration class inadvertently
established a package cycle between beans.factory.aspectj and
context.annotation due to SpringConfiguredConfiguration's
dependency on annotations such as @Configuration, @Bean and @Role.

This commit fixes this architecture bug by moving
@EnableSpringConfigured and SpringConfiguredConfiguration from the
beans.factory.aspectj package to the context.annotation package where
they belong.

This change is assumed to be very low impact as @EnableSpringConfigured
was introduced in 3.1.0 and relocation is happening as quickly as
possible in 3.1.2. @EnableSpringConfigured is assumed to be infrequently
used at this point, and for those that are the migration path
is straightforward. When upgrading from Spring 3.1.0 or 3.1.1, update
import statements in any affected @Configuration classes to reflect the
new packaging.
