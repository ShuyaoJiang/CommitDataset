Log WebSocket connection issues at DEBUG level

WebSocket clients going away is an expected and common occurance.
Logging at ERROR level on failure to close a connection or on failures
to write data to a WebSocket sessions has a high potential for false
positives with very little to do. This change lowers the log level for
a number of log messages that fit this category.

This should be helped by the effort already spent for 4.1 to ensure
logging at DEBUG level doesn't produce excessive amounts of logging.
