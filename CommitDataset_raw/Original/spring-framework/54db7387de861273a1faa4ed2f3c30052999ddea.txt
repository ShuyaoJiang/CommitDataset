Fix split package introduced by @EnableSpringConfigured

Commit 5327a7a37d25b67ee2ae7d1ead2a3db6847767c0 moved
@EnableSpringConfigured from beans.factory.aspectj =>
context.annotation within the spring-aspects module. This resolved a
package cycle but had the side-effect of causing a "split package" [1]
problem between spring-context and spring-aspects in OSGi-based
classloader environments because the context.annotation package now
exists in both modules.

The simplest and best solution from an OSGi perspective is to relocate
@EnableSpringConfigured and its supporting SpringConfiguredConfiguration
class into a new package. This commit moves both these types into
context.annotation.aspectj, following convention with other such
"aspectj"-qualified packages in the spring-aspects module.

As with the previous move, it is presumed this change will be low-impact
as the "spring-configured" approach to domain object injection is a
niche feature to begin with, and @EnableSpringConfigured has existed in
its current location only since 3.1.2 and this change is being made in
time for 3.1.3.
