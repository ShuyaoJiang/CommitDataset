Move builder methods to VersionResourceResolver

This change moves the VersionStrategy builder-style methods from
ResourceHandlerRegistration to VersionResourceResolver.

This makes the methods more universally usable and also makes use of
ResourceHandlerRegistration more readable, i.e. simply a sequence of
addResource and addTransformer calls.
