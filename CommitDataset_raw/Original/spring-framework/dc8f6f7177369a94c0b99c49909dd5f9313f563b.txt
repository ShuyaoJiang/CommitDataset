Upgrade to CGLIB 3.2.9

This CGLIB upgrade literally does not make any difference to Spring users since its only purpose is a default ASM7 declaration in its AsmApi class (which we patched a month ago). We nevertheless leave our local AsmApi copy in place for the time being, allowing for an individual upgrade of the declared ASM API version in the future.
