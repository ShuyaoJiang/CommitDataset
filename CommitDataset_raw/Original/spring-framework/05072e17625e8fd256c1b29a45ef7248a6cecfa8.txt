Expand var-args before passing to KeyGenerator

Update `CacheAspectSupport` to expand any var-arg parameters before
calling `KeyGenerator` implementations. Prior to this commit var-args
would be passed to `KeyGenerator` implementations as a nested array,
often causing the same key to be generated regardless of the arguments.
