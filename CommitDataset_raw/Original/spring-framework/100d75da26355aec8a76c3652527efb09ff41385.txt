Fix client-library-url ignored in MVC namespace

Prior to this commit, the `client-library-url` XML attribute was not
effective in the MVC namespace, leaving the default value configured:

```xml
<websocket:sockjs client-library-url="/js/sockjs.js" />
```

This commit fixes the sockjs namespace handler and makes sure that this
attribute is configured on the `SockJsService` Bean to be created.

Issue: SPR-12874
