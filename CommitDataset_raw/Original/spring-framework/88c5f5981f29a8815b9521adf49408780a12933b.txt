Added DataBuffer Encoder/Decoder

This commit adds a DataBuffer Encoder and Decoder, and uses it in
the annotation-based processing model.

Note that these codecs are not used in the functional processing model,
since the BodyInserter/BodyExtractor already have methods for
writing/reading DataBuffers.

Issue: SPR-15148
