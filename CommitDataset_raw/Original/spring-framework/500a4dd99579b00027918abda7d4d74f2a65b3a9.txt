Fix tx annotated tests so that they pass in the build

AbstractTransactionalAnnotatedConfigClassTests is now annotated with
@DirtiesContext(classMode = ClassMode.AFTER_EACH_TEST_METHOD) so 
that side-effects between tests are avoided.

Re-enabled TransactionalAnnotatedConfigClassWithAtConfigurationTests
and TransactionalAnnotatedConfigClassesWithoutAtConfigurationTests.

Also introduced a log4j FileAppender for tests that writes to
"build/spring-test.log".
