Introduce class-level @DirtiesContext tests for TestNG

Prior to this commit, ClassLevelDirtiesContextTests existed for
verifying the expected behavior of @DirtiesContext declared at the
class level in conjunction with JUnit and SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.

This commit introduces analogous tests for TestNG in the new
ClassLevelDirtiesContextTestNGTests class.

Furthermore, ContextCacheTestUtils and TrackingTestNGTestListener have
been introduced to reduce code duplication across the test suite.

Issue: SPR-12918
