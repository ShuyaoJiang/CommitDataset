Fixed potential NPE in SharedEntityManagerCreator

Fix SharedEntityManagerCreator.createSharedEntityManager to correctly
forward an empty array in case that EntityManagerFactoryInfo returns
null from getEntityManagerInterface().

Previously the var-args invocation had turned null into an array with
a null value which caused a NullPointerException in the call to
Proxy.newProxyInstance() further down the call stack.
