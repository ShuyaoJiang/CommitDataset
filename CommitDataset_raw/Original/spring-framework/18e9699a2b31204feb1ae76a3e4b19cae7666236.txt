Demo @ContextConfiguration as composed annotation with ACI

classes via an ApplicationContextInitializer in a composed annotation so
that certain @Configuration classes are always registered whenever the
composed annotation is used, even if the composed annotation is used to
declare additional @Configuration classes.
