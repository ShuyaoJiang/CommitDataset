Several enhancements with respect to CachingMetadataReaderFactory handling.

Added "clearCache()" method to CachingMetadataReaderFactory, for clearing the metadata cache once not needed anymore - in particular when the MetadataReaderFactory instance is long-lived. Also added "setMetadataReaderFactory" method to ClassPathScanningCandidateComponentProvider, analogous to ConfigurationClassPostProcessor.
