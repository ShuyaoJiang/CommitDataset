Fix Eclipse support in Gradle build

The upgrade to Gradle 4.0 broke the custom Eclipse support in the
Spring Framework build.

This commit includes the following changes which re-enable support for
Eclipse in the build.

- Switched to ProjectDependency(String) constructor

- Updated regular expression that matches against project output
  dependencies to include more than one subdirectory between "build"
  and "main"|"test".

Issue: SPR-15862
