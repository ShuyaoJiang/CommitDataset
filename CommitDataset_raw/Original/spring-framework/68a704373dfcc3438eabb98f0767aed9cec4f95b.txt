Retain order of active profiles in the TCF

Ever since @ActiveProfiles was introduced, the declared active profiles
for integration tests have been sorted in order to support unique cache
key generation; however, there are use cases for which the original
ordering should be retained.

For example, Spring Boot's ConfigFileApplicationListener loads
configuration files for active profiles in the order returned by
Environment.getActiveProfiles(), with the assumption that the ordering
matches the order in which the developer declared the active profiles.

This commit maintains the uniqueness of active profiles declared via
@ActiveProfiles but no longer sorts them.

Issue: SPR-12492
