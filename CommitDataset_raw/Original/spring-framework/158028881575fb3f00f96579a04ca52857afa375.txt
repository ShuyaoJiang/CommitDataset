Improve error reporting in ScriptTemplateView

This commit introduces a new ScriptRenderException in order to:
 - Print in the resulting error page the reason of the script failure
 - Not print the whole stacktrace in the logs

The ScriptRenderException thrown in ScriptTemplateView#renderMergedOutputModel()
is wrapped into a ServletException in order to avoid printing 2 times the messages in
the logs (throwing directly a ScriptRenderException would make it wrapped in a
NestedServletException that contains a getMessage() override not needed in this
context)

Issue: SPR-13488
