Add ResolvedResource in resource handling chain

Prior to this commit, the resource handling chain and its
`ResourceResolvers` would use specific `Resource` implementations in
order to add resource metadata to the HTTP response. For example,
`VersionedResource` and `EncodedResource` are both adding specific HTTP
response headers.

This commit aims at making this mechanism more stable and reusable,
since the previous implementation would fail in case a resolved resource
would be both a `VersionedResource` wrapping a `EncodedResource` (or the
other way arount). Only one of the specific implementations would
contribute its metadata since the code supporting that in
`ResourceHttpRequestHandler` would only check for `instanceof` tests,
whereas those implementations are acutally delegating calls to
the wrapped resource.

Now both `VersionedResource` and `EncodedResource` have been replaced by
specific implementations of `ResolvedResource`, which directly provides
those HTTP response headers as part of `getResponseHeaders()`.

This commit applies the same changes for the web reactive
implementations and its `ResourceWebHandler`.
