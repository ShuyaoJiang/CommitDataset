Log context cache statistics in the TCF

Prior to this commit, finding out how many application contexts had
been loaded within a test suite required the use of reflection and a
bit of hacking.

This commit addresses this issue by logging ContextCache statistics
whenever an application context is loaded by the Spring TestContext
Framework (TCF).

The log output can be enabled by setting the
"org.springframework.test.context.cache" logging category to DEBUG.

Issue: SPR-12409
