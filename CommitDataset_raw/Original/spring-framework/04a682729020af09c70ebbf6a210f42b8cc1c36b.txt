Reproduce claims raised in SPR-8849

This commit introduces a test suite (Spr8849Tests) that demonstrates
the claims made in SPR-8849.

Specifically, if <jdbc:embedded-database id="xyz" /> is used to create
an embedded HSQL database in an XML configuration file and that
configuration file is imported in different sets of configuration files
that are used to load ApplicationContexts for different integration
tests, the embedded database will be initialized multiple times using
any nested <jdbc:script /> elements. If such a script is used to create
a table, for example, subsequent attempts to initialize the database
named "xyz" will fail since an embedded database named "xyz" already
exists in the JVM.

As a work-around, this test suite uses a SpEL expression to generate a
random string for each embedded database instance:

  id="#{T(java.util.UUID).randomUUID().toString()}"

See the Javadoc in Spr8849Tests for further information.
