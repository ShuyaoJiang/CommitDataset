Don't throw NPE when serving webjar directories

Prior to this change, serving resources with ResourceHttpRequestHandler
could result in NPE when requesting an existing folder located in a JAR.

This commit swallows those exceptions, as it is not possible to foresee
those cases without reading the actual resource. This result in a HTTP
200 response with a zero Content-Length instead of a HTTP 500 internal
exception.

Issue: SPR-13620
