Fix bytecode generation for SpEL OpPlus

Without this change the plus operator would fail to
include a CHECKCAST in generated bytecode when it
was compiled in cases where one of the operands
has a runtime type of String but a statically
declared type that was not String (i.e. Object).

Issue: SPR-12426
