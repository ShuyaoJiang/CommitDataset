Deprecate DefaultUriTemplate handler

Following on the introduction of the UriBuilderFactory and its
DefaultUriBuilderFactory implementation, this commit deprecates
DefaultUriTemplate (and AbstractUriTemplateHandler).

The new DefaultUriBuilderFactory has comparable functionality and is
more flexible but cannot be merged  into the existing hierarchy and
be backwards compatible with regards to protected methods.

Issue: SPR-15124
