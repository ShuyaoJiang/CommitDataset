Introduce failing test for SPR-16652

This commit introduces tests for looking up annotations on parameters
in constructors for nested and inner classes via Spring's
MethodParameter abstraction.

The test for an inner class is currently disabled since it fails on
JDK 8. See JIRA issue for details.

Issue: SPR-16652
