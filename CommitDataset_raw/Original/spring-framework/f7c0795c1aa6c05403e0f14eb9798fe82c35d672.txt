Add TestGroup.CUSTOM_COMPILATION

Previously building with JDK > 1.8 b88 caused test failures due to errors
with custom compilers like Jibx and Jasper reports.

This commit adds a new TestGroup named CUSTOM_COMPILATION that allows the
CI server to continue to run these tests but allow committers to ignore
these tests.
