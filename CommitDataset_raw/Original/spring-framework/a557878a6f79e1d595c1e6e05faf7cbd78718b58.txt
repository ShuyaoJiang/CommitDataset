Document @Autowired and @Value limitations

@Autowired, @Value and other annotations cannot be applied within
Spring Bean(Factory)PostProcessor types, because they themselves
are processed using BeanPostProcessors.  Javadoc and reference docs
have been updated to reflect.

Issue: SPR-4935, SPR-8213
