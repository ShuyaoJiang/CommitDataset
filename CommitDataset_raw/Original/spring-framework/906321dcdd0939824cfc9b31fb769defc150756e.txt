Fix broken tests in QuartzSupportTests

This commit ensures that QuartzSupportTests and its related
configuration are compatible with Quartz 2.1.7.

 - Test jobs are now durable where required.

 - Deleted legacy tests that attempted to use a Runnable instead of a
   Job as a jobClass for a JobDetail.

 - Replaced quartz-hsql.sql with current version for Quartz 2.1.7.
