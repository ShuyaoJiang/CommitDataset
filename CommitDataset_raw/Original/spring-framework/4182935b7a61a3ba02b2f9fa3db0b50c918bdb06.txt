Revert optimization in StringDecoder

This commit reverts the first optimizations listed in
fa096dc60f0e78dd1d0d061f9fb7053954a52fb4, as the default delimiters
do vary, namely by the charset given in the message mime type.
The mimetype charset might not be compatible with ASCII (i.e. anything
but UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1, for instance it might be UTF-16), and will not
successfully find the default delimiters as a consequence.

Added test to indicate the bug.
