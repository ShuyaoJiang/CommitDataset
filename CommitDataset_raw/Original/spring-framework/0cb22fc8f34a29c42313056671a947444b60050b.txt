Use SoftReferences for context caching in the TCF

Prior to this commit, the ContextCache in the Spring TestContext
Framework (TCF) cached ApplicationContexts in a ConcurrentHashMap using
strong references. This practice can occasionally lead to
OutOfMemoryErrors when running a large number of tests in a test suite
with varying context configuration since the context cache becomes
overpopulated over time.

This commit addresses this issue by using Spring's
ConcurrentReferenceHashMap which uses SoftReferences for both the keys
(i.e., MergedContextConfiguration instances) and values (i.e.,
ApplicationContexts) stored in the map that backs the ContextCache.

Issue: SPR-7687
