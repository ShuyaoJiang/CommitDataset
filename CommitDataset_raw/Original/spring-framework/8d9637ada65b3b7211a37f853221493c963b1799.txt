Provide JdbcTemplate in tx base classes in the TCF

Since Spring 2.5, the abstract transactional base classes in the
TestContext framework have defined and delegated to a protected
SimpleJdbcTemplate instance variable; however, SimpleJdbcTemplate has
deprecated since Spring 3.1. Consequently, subclasses of
AbstractTransactionalJUnit4SpringContextTests and
AbstractTransactionalTestNGSpringContextTests that use this instance
variable suffer from seemingly unnecessary deprecation warnings.

This commit addresses this issue by introducing a protected JdbcTemplate
instance variable in abstract transactional base classes to replace the
use of the existing SimpleJdbcTemplate. Furthermore, the existing
simpleJdbcTemplate instance variable has been deprecated, and utility
methods in the affected base classes now delegate to JdbcTestUtils
instead of the now deprecated SimpleJdbcTestUtils.

Issue: SPR-8990
