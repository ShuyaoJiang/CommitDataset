Support @Cache* as merged composed annotations

Prior to this commit, @Cacheable, @CacheEvict, @CachePut, and @Caching
could be used to create custom stereotype annotations with hardcoded
values for their attributes; however, it was not possible to create
composed annotations with attribute overrides.

This commit addresses this issue by refactoring
SpringCacheAnnotationParser to use the newly introduced
findAllMergedAnnotations() method in AnnotatedElementUtils. As a
result, @Cacheable, @CacheEvict, @CachePut, and @Caching can now be
used to create custom composed annotations with attribute overrides
configured via @AliasFor.

Issue: SPR-13475
