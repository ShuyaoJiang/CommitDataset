Make RequestMappingHandlerMapping xml config easier

Prior to this commit, it was necessary to override
the HandlerMapping definition to change properties
like useSuffixPatternMatch, useSuffixPatternMatch...

This commits adds new attributes on the
mvc:annotation-driven XML tag that allows to configure
such flags:
* use-suffix-pattern-match
* use-trailing-slash-match
* use-registered-suffix-pattern-match

Issue: SPR-10163
