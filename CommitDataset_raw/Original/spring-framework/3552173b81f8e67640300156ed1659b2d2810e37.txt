Fix issue in AnnotationMethodHandlerExceptionResolver

Caching of resovled exceptions introduced in SPR-7703 also introduced a
side effect whereby if exactly one exception was previously cached, any
other exception would appear as a match to the previously matched
@ExceptionHandler method.

This change ensures use of a fresh map when determining matching
@ExceptionHandler methods while also updating the cache.

Issue: SPR-9209
