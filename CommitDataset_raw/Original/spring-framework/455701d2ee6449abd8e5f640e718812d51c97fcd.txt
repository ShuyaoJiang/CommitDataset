Merge plugin copies exclude rules

Previously the 'merge from' project's configurations exclude rules were
not used in the dynamically created 'merge into' project configurations.
This meant that the pom generation for 'merge into' project did not
exclude the dependencies from the 'merge from' project's configuration
excludes.

Now the exclude rules are copied into the dynamically created
'merge into' project's configurations.
