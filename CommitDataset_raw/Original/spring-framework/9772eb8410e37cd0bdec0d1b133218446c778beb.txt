Deprecated Spring's own JSP expression evaluation

Since web applications declaring a Servlet 2.3 web.xml become really rare now, we're finally deprecating Spring's own ExpressionEvaluationUtils class. As a consequence, we're also setting "springJspExpressionSupport" to false by default, avoiding the potential double EL evaluation problem on pre-Servlet-3.0 containers.

Issue: SPR-5308
