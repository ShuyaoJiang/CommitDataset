Fix directories I/O in ResourceHttpRequestHandler

Prior to this commit, the `ResourceHttpRequestHandler` would not
properly handle HTTP requests to **directories contained in JARs**.
This would result in HTTP 500 errors, caused by `FileNotFoundException`
or `NullPointerException`.

This can be tracked to webapp ClassLoader implementations in servlet
containers:
* in Jetty9x, fetching a directory within a JAR as a `Resource` and
getting its InputStream work fine, but attempting to `close()` it
results in a NullPointerException as the underlying stream is null.
* In Tomcat6x, one cannot fetch an InputStream for the same `Resource`
as it throws a FileNotFoundException.

This change adds more try/catch clauses and catches more Exception so as
to result in HTTP 200 OK responses instead of server errors. While this
is inconsistent because the same code path would result in HTTP 404 with
existing directories on the file system, there's no other simple way to
make those checks for resources contained in JARs.
