Add flush method to ServerHttpResponse

This is useful to make sure response headers are written to the
underlying response. It is also useful in conjunction with long
running, async requests and HTTP streaming, to ensure the Servlet
response buffer is sent to the client without additional delay and
also causes an IOException to be raised if the client has gone away.
