Support [] array ref syntax in SpEL T() construct

Prior to this change, SpEL would not allow the use of '[]' in
expressions like the following:

    T(foo.Bar[])

This commit updates TypeReference and InternalSpelExpressionParser to
support this syntax, avoiding the need for workarounds like:

    new foo.bar[0].class

Issue: SPR-9203
