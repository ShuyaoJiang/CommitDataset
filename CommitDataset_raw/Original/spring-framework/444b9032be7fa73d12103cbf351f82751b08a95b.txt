Apply DestinationResolver to listener container

Previously, a custom `DestinationResolver` was not made available
to the underlying `MessageListener`: if a reply needs to be sent, the
default `DestinationResolver` was used.

This commit ensures that if a custom `DestinationResolver` has been set,
it is also configured accordingly for replies.
