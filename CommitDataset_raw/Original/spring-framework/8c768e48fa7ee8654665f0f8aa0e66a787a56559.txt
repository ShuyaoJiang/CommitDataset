Use Spring Doc Resources for reference docs

This commit removes the custom static resources for the reference
documentation and instead uses the new Spring Doc Resources project
https://github.com/spring-io/spring-doc-resources

The asciidoctor theme is now shared between Spring projects and
integrated in the project build.
