Implement invalidate() properly in MockHttpSession

The invalidate() method in MockHttpSession is currently implemented
incorrectly. According to the Servlet specification, the method should
throw an IllegalStateException if it is invoked on an already
invalidated session. However, invoking invalidate() on the same
MockHttpSession instance multiple times does not throw an exception.

This commits addresses this issue by checking the invalid field and
throwing an IllegalStateException if it has already been set to true.
