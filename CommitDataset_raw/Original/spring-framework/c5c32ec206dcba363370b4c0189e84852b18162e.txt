Refer to static nested classes, not static inner classes

Various parts of the reference manual as well as the Javadoc for
AnnotationConfigContextLoaderUtils improperly refer to "static inner
classes" even though this terminology does not exist in Java. The Java
Language Specification explicitly refers to such classes as "static
nested classes." An "inner class" must be non-static by definition.
