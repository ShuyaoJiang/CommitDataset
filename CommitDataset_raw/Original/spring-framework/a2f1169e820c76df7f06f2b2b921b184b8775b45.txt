Don't detect annotations on superclass in StAnMeta

Changes introduced in conjunction with issue SPR-11475 altered the
behavior of StandardAnnotationMetadata such that annotations could be
detected on superclasses, specifically in the case where the
AnnotatedElementUtils.getAllAnnotationAttributes() method is invoked to
obtain multiple annotations of the same type (on the lowest level in the
class hierarchy), as is the case for @Profile and @Conditional.

This commit partially reverts these changes as follows:

 - All methods in AnnotatedElementUtils now set the
   traverseClassHierarchy to false, thereby effectively reverting the
   changes made in commit 1d30bf83a0d6f303ce38526286b90172c3c596c6.
   Note, however, that the changes made to AnnotationUtils remain in
   place.

 - Introduced tests in AnnotationMetadataTests that verify behavior
   present in Spring Framework 4.0.2 and earlier.

 - Updated tests in AnnotatedElementUtilsTests so that they pass against
   the reverted changes (i.e., align with the behavior present in Spring
   Framework 4.0.2 and earlier).

 - Refined Javadoc in AnnotationMetadata with regard to annotations
   being "present" vs. "defined".

 - Refined Javadoc in AnnotatedTypeMetadata.
