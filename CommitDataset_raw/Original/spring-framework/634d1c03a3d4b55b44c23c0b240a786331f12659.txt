Introduce @EnabledIf support for JUnit Jupiter

This commit picks up where SPR-14614 left off by introducing a new
@EnabledIf annotation to serve as a logical companion to @DisabledIf.

In addition, this commit extracts common logic from DisabledIfCondition
into a new AbstractExpressionEvaluatingCondition base class which the
new EnabledIfCondition also extends.

An @EnabledOnMac annotation is also included in the Javadoc as well as
in the test suite to demonstrate support for custom composed annotations.

Issue: SPR-14644
