Make SocketUtils a concrete class

Per the Javadoc for the SocketUtils() constructor, SocketUtils can be
instantiated as a Spring Bean in XML configuration files; however,
SocketUtils is currently abstract which prevents such usage.

This commit removes the 'abstract' declaration thereby allowing
SocketUtils to be instantiated as a Spring bean.

Issue: SPR-12169
