getAcceptLanguageAsLocale(s) returns most preferred Locale

An update on the last commit switching from:
List<Locale> getAcceptLanguageAsLocales() to
Locale getAcceptLanguageAsLocale()

This best supports the scenario for the most preferred Locale.
If there is a need to look at the prioritized list of languages it's
best to use Locale.filter with the LocaleRange's.

This is explained in the Javadoc for getAcceptLanguage().
