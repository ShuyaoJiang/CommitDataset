Add an ObjectMapper constructor to MappingJackson2(Json|Xml)View

Instead of having to use the default constructor then calling
setObjectMapper(ObjectMapper), these constructors allow
MappingJackson2JsonView and MappingJackson2XmlView to be created and
configured with the desired object mapper in one step.
