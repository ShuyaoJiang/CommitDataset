Reuse mock request from the TCF in Spring MVC Test

Prior to this commit, the Spring MVC Test Framework always created a
new MockHttpServletRequest, disregarding any mock request already
present in Spring Web's RequestContextHolder -- for example, one
created by the ServletTestExecutionListener in the Spring TestContext
Framework (TCF).

This commit modifies MockHttpServletRequestBuilder so that it reuses a
mock request created by the TCF. However,
MockMultipartHttpServletRequestBuilder continues to always create a new
MockMultipartHttpServletRequest since a MockHttpServletRequest created
by the TCF is not directly compatible with a
MockMultipartHttpServletRequest. Furthermore, in order to avoid
unforeseen side effects, MockHttpServletRequestBuilder will always
create a new MockHttpServletRequest if a mock request is present in the
RequestContextHolder but not created by the TCF.
