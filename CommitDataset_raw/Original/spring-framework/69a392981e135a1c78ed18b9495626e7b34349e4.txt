Upgrade JarJar to version 1.3

JarJar 1.3 now uses ASM 4 in order to be compatible with Java 7
'invokedynamic' instructions. This is not an immediate concern for
the classes that we use JarJar to repackage and transform, but is a
timely upgrade in anticipation of the subsequent commits in which we
upgrade Spring's own dependency on ASM from 2.2.3 to 4.0 and Spring's
dependency on CGLIB from 2.2 to 3.0 (which in turn depends on ASM 4.0).
