Fix nested @Component annotation instantiation bug

3.1 M2 introduced a regression that causes false positives during
@Configuration class candidate checks. Now performing a call to
AnnotationMetadata#isInterface in addition to checks for @Component and
@Bean annotations when determining whether a candidate is a 'lite'
configuration class. Annotations are in the end interfaces, so both
are filtered out at once.

Issue: SPR-8761
