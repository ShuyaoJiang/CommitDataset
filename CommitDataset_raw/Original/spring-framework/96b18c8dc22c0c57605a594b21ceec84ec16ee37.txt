Add ResponseBodyInterceptor

This change introduces a new ResponseBodyInterceptor interface that can
be used to modify the response after @ResponseBody or ResponseEntity
methods but before the body is actually written to the response with the
selected HttpMessageConverter.

The RequestMappingHandlerAdapter and ExceptionHandlerExceptionResolver
each have a property to configure such interceptors. In addition both
RequestMappingHandlerAdapter and ExceptionHandlerExceptionResolver
detect if any @ControllerAdvice bean implements ResponseBodyInterceptor
and use it accordingly.
