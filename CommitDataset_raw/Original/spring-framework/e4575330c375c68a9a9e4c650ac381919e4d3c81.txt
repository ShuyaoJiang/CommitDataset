Support empty body in Jackson2JsonDecoder.decodeToMono

Prior to this commit, extracting an HTTP response with an empty body
and no Content-Type header using the WebClient would:

* trigger the use of the Jackson2JsonDecoder
* throw a NoSuchElementException because of the use of `Flux.single()`

This commit changes this behavior to `Flux.singleOrEmpty()` to avoid
throwing exceptions for empty Flux instances.

Issue: SPR-14582
