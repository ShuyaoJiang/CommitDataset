Add RestTemplate constructor with custom converters

Prior to this commit, RestTemplate's constructors were all initializing
default HTTPMessageConverters. Its API provides a way to replace
those converters with custom ones, but default converters are already
defined and initialized at that point, which can be an issue in some
cases (performance, classpath...).

This commits adds a new constructor for RestTemplate with a list
of message converters as argument. With this new constructor,
default message converters are never initialized.

Issue: SPR-11351
