Refine hamcrest dependency in spring-test-mvc project

1) removed the hamcrest-all dependency requirement and replaced it with
the more focused hamcrest-library dependency

2) added MatcherAssertionErrors as a replacement of
org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert, which in hamcrest 1.1 is only available
through the hamcrest-all dependency (and not in hamcrest-core nor in
the hamcrest embedded in JUnit 4.4 through 4.8)

3) changed the required hamcrest version from 1.1 to 1.3 and made sure
the spring-test-mvc project does not rely on newer hamcrest
functionality without checking if it is available first

Applications that already depend on older versions of hamcrest
(in particular 1.1) via hamcrest-library, hamcrest-all or as part of
junit 4.4 through 4.8 should not be disrupted if they add spring-test
but may wish to exclude the hamcrest-library transitive dependency
from spring-test in order to avoid extra jars in the classpath

Applications that depend on hamcrest 1.3 should not have to do anything
