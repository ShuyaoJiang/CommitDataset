Fix host+port resolution in ReactorServerHttpRequest

Prior to this commit, the host+port information of the incoming request
where taken from the remoteAddress, which is actually the socket address
of the HTTP client (i.e. not the server).

This commit resolves this information from the "Host" HTTP request
header, if available, or the actual local address of the channel if no
header is available.

Issue: SPR-15084
