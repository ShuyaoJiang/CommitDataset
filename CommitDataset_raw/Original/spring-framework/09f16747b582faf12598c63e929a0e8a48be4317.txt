Fix MergePlugin transitive dependencies

A little terminiology first:

* merge.from - a project that contains source that will be merged
               into merge.into
* merge.into - a project that contains source code that will have
               code from merge.from merged into it.

Previously a module that dependended on merge.into would not see
the merge.from module as a transitive dependency. This worked fine
from a Gradle build because all the code from merge.from is merged
into the merge.into jar. However, in an IDE it did not work because
the IDE does not assemble a jar.

This fix ensures that merge.from modules are automatically added
to the classpath of any module relying on the merge.into project.

Fixes SPR-14650
