Remove remaining static Eclipse/IDEA metadata

Eclipse .project, .classpath, and .settings metadata have already been
removed. Now removing Eclipse .psf and formatter XML files from the root
project as well as removing all manually-maintained IDEA .iml and .ipr
files.

This is in favor of using Gradle's own 'eclipse' and 'idea' tasks that
generate this kind of metadata on the fly.

.gitignore has been updated to ignore these files going forward. In any
case, they should not be checked into the source tree! The README.md
file will be updated to explain how to generate these files using gradle
and how to import the projects into your IDE of choice.
