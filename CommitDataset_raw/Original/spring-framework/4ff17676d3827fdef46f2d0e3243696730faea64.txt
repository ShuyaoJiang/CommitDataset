Avoid duplicate Content-Length headers in Netty client

This commit checks that a "Content-Length" request header isn't already
present before adding one in `Netty4ClientHttpRequestFactory`.
`HttpMessageConverter` implementations can write that request header so
the Netty request factory should only write that value when the header
is missing.

If that header is not written (and since we're not dealing with
the HTTP exchange in a chunked-based fashion), the HTTP client might not
send the request body at all.
