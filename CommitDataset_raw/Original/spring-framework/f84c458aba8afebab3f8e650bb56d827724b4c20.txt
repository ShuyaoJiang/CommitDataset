Add fromHttpRequest to UriComponentsBuilder

Before this change, detection of X-Forwarded-* headers was only built
into ServletUriComponentsBuilder.

This change adds a new method for creating a UriComponentsBuilder from
an existing HttpRequest. This is equivalent to the fromUri method +
X-Forwarded-* header values.
