Compensate for changes in JDK 7 Introspector

Prior to JDK 7, java.beans.Introspector registered indexed write methods
irrespective of return type, for example either of the following methods
were legal

    void setFoo(int i, Foo foo)
    Object setFoo(int i, Foo foo)

This was considered a bug and disallowed starting with JDK 7, such that
only the former signature is a candidate.

Supporting non-void returning setter methods is exactly what
ExtendedBeanInfo was designed to do, and prior to this commit, the
implementation of ExtendedBeanInfo assumed this (somewhat surprising)
behavior from the underlying Introspector, and because it worked out of
the box, took no extra steps to recognize and register these methods.
For this reason, non-void returning indexed write methods were not
registered under JDK 7+, causing test failures in ExtendedBeanInfoTests.

Now the implementation is careful to detect these methods without any
assumption about Introspector behavior, such that they are registered in
exactly the same fashion across JDK versions.
