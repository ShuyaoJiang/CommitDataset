Rm buildSrc/src/main/groovy from Eclipse Sources

Previously buildSrc/src/main/groovy was a source folder within Eclipse.
This caused build errors due to missing dependencies for Gradle.

This commit removes buildSrc/src/main/groovy from the source folders
within Eclipse to prevent errors from being displayed.
