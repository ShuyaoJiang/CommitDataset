Add PathPatternRegistry

This commit adds the new `PathPatternRegistry`, which  holds a
sorted set of `PathPattern`s and allows for searching/adding patterns

This registry is being used in `HandlerMapping` implementations and
separates path pattern parsing/matching logic from the rest. Directly
using `PathPattern` instances should improve the performance of those
`HandlerMapping` implementations, since the parsing and generation of
pattern variants (trailing slash, suffix patterns, etc) is done only
once.
