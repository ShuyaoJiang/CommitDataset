Revisit ScriptTemplateView resource loading

Resources are now retrieved using the application context in order to
support natively non-classpath locations like /WEB-INF/...

As a consequence of this refactoring, ScriptTemplateView#createClassLoader()
protected method as been removed, since it did not make sense anymore with
this new resource loading implementation.
