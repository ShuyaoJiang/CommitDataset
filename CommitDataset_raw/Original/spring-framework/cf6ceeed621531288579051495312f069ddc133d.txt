Allow Splitting/aggregation operations in Decoders

When decoding buffers as plain strings, the StringDecoder returns a
Publisher that may produce one or more `onNext` events.
This is perfectly valid, but leads to errors when trying to convert the
resulting Publisher into a `reactor.Mono` or `rx.Single`.

If the original Publisher emits 2 or more `onNext` signals,
converting to:
* `rx.Single` will throw an error saying that the underlying Observable
"emitted too many elements"
* `reactor.Mono` may contain only the first emitted element

This commit adds a `AbstractRawByteStreamDecoder` that takes a
`SubscriberBarrier` to apply splitting/aggregation operations on the
received elements.
The `StringDecoder` class now inherits from this abstract class and
uses one of the provided `SubscriberBarrier` implementations to
buffer all received elements in a single buffer.
