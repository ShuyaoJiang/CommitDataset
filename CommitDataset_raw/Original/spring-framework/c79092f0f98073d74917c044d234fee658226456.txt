Refactor random port in reactive module tests

This commit removes the use of SocketUtils#findAvailableTcpPort in
favor of letting servers pick a dynamic port by specifying port 0.

This should make integration tests more stable because the port is
chosen at the place where it needs to be used. It gives servers a
chance to try to open a socket on some port and start using the socket
if successful.
