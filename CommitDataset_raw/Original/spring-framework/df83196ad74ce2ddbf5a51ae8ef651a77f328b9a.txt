Update required email dependencies in reference manual

Beginning with Java 6, the JavaBeans Activation Framework (JAF) is part
of the JDK. Thus, there is no longer a need to explicitly include a
dependency on `activation.jar` when using Spring's email support in
Spring Framework 4.0 and higher which anyway requires Java 6 or higher.

This commit therefore removes the JAF requirement from the reference
manual.
