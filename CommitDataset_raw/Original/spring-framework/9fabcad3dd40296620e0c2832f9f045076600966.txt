Revisit JmsMessagingTemplate

This commit revisits JmsMessagingTemplate and adds support for
receiving operations as well. JmsMessageSendingOperations has been
renamed to JmsMessageOperations.

The messaging abstraction did not split receiving and request-reply
operations. AbstractMessageReceivingTemplate has been created to hold
only the receiving operations.

Issue: SPR-11772
