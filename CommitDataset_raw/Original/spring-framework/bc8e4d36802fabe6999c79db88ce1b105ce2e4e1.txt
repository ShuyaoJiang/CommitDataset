Fix SpEL varargs handling and usage of other getValue() methods

Building on the initial work for SPR-12326, this commit
addresses three problems:

Firstly the ReflectiveMethodResolver is modified to consider
a direct parameter match more important than a varargs match.
Also in that same type when there are a number of close
matches, the first one is taken rather than the last one.

Secondly more testcases and better support have been added
for the case of passing a single parameter to a varargs
accepting method.

Finally it is possible to set the root context object
indirectly and not pass it on getValue() calls to the
expression objects but not all variants of getValue()
were handling that. This is now fixed.

Issue: SPR-12326
