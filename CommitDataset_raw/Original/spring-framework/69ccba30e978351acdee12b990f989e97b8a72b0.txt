Introduce write aggregator to DataBufferUtils

As a consequence of dropping CompositeByteBuf (see prior commit),
DataBuffers fluxes that are aggregated with Flux.reduce(BiFunction) are
now required to be released, as the composite no longer holds a
reference to subsequent data buffers.

For this purpose, DataBufferUtils now has a writeAggregator that can be
used with Flux.reduce, and that released the subsequent buffers
properly.
