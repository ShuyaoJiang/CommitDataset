Helpers for get/post in RequestMappingIntegrationTests

This commit replaces the current helper methods in
RequestMappingIntegrationTests with generic helper methods to perform
HTTP GET and POST requests.

This results in more transparent code that shows the exact HTTP
inputs and outputs and is also more flexible to change for
variations in testing.
