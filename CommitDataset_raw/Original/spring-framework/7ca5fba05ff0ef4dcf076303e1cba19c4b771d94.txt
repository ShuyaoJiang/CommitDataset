Avoid infinite loop in AbstractResource#contentLength

Due to changes made in commit 2fa87a71 for SPR-9118,
AbstractResource#contentLength would fall into an infinite loop unless
the method were overridden by a subclass (which it is in the majority of
use cases).

This commit:

 - fixes the infinite recursion by refactoring to a while loop

 - asserts that the value returned from #getInputStream is not null in
   order to avoid NullPointerException

 - tests both of the above

 - adds Javadoc to the Resource interface to clearly document that the
   contract for any implementation is that #getInputStream must not
   return null

Issue: SPR-9161
