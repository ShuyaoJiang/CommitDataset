UndertowServerHttpRequest: suspend reading when no demand

- When there is no demand for reading, the implementation
should suspend reading otherwise useless events will be
send by Undertow to the registered read listener.
- There is not need to wait for an event for reading/writing after calling
resumeReads/resumeWrites
