Support generic target types in the RestTemplate

This change makes it possible to use the RestTemplate to read an HTTP
response into a target generic type object. The RestTemplate has three
new exchange(...) methods that accept ParameterizedTypeReference -- a
new class that enables capturing and passing generic type info.
See the Javadoc of the three new methods in RestOperations for a
short example.

To support this feature, the HttpMessageConverter is now extended by
GenericHttpMessageConverter, which adds a method for reading an
HttpInputMessage to a specific generic type. The new interface
is implemented by the MappingJacksonHttpMessageConverter and also by a
new Jaxb2CollectionHttpMessageConverter that can read read a generic
Collection where the generic type is a JAXB type annotated with
@XmlRootElement or @XmlType.
