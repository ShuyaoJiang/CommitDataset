Support target type in JsonPath assertions for MockMvc results

This commit picks up where SPR-14498 left off by adding support for an
explicit target type when using JsonPath to perform an assertion against
the response content using a Hamcrest Matcher.

Specifically, there is a new overloaded value(Matcher<T>, Class<T>)
method in JsonPathResultMatchers for use with Hamcrest matchers where
the target type (i.e., Class<T>) can be specified.

Issue: SPR-16587
