SPR-8976 Make flash attrs available to view controllers.

Previously flash attributes were automatically merged into the
model of annotated controllers only. This change extends the same
benefit to ParameterizableView- and UrlFilenameViewController,
both of which merely select a view without user controller logic
and (the views) would otherwise  not have access to the flash
attributes.
