Fix compiler warnings

This patch fixes several compiler warnings that do not point to code
problems. Two kinds of warnings are fixed. First in a lot of cases
@SuppressWarnings("unchecked") is used although there are no unchecked
casts happening. This seems to be a leftover from when the code base
was on Java 1.4, now that the code base was moved to Java 1.5 these are
no longer necessary. Secondly there some places where the raw types of
List and Class are used where there wildcard types (List<?> and
Class<?>) would work just as well without causing any raw type warnings.

These changes are beneficial particularly when working in Eclipse or
other IDEs because it reduces 'noise', helping to isolate actual
potential problems in the code.

The following changes have been made:

 - remove @SuppressWarnings where no longer needed

 - use wildcard types instead of raw types where possible
