Remove stale duplicate copy of spring-cache XSD

This was removed once previously but accidentally re-introduced later.
The 'correct' version of spring-cache-3.1.xsd lives in spring-context
as opposed to here in spring-context-support.

Also placed .gitignore file within src/main/resources such that the
now-empty directory does not get pruned in git environments, which will
otherwise cause 'missing source folder' errors within Eclipse/IDEA.
