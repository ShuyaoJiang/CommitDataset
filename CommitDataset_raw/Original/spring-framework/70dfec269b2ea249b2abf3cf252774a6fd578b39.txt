Use alternative UUID strategy in MessageHeaders

This change adds an alternative UUID generation strategy to use by
default in MessageHeaders. Instead of using SecureRandom for each
new UUID, SecureRandom is used only for the initial seed to be
provided java.util.Random. Thereafter the same Random instance is
used instead. This provides improved performance while id's are
still random but less securely so.
