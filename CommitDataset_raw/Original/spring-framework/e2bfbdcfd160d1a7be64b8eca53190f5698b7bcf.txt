Support attribute overrides with @ResponseStatus

This commit introduces support for attribute overrides for
@ResponseStatus when @ResponseStatus is used as a meta-annotation on
a custom composed annotation.

Specifically, this commit migrates all code that looks up
@ResponseStatus from using AnnotationUtils.findAnnotation() to using
AnnotatedElementUtils.findMergedAnnotation().

Issue: SPR-13441
