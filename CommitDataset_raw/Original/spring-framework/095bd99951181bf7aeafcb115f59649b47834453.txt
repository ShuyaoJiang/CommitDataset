Add support for inline maps in SpEL expressions

This commit introduces the ability to specify an inline map in
an expression. The syntax is similar to inline lists and of
the form: "{key:value,key2:value}". The keys can optionally
be quoted. The documentation is also updated with information
on the syntax.

Issue: SPR-9472
