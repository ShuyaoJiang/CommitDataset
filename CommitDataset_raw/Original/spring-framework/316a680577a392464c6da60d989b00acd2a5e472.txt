Modify getPathRemaining to return remaining path and bound variables

Without this change it was necessary to call getPathRemaining and
then chop up the path and make a call to matchAndExtract to get the
bound variables for the path part that matched. With this change
this is all done in the call to getPathRemaining which returns
an object holding the remaining path and the bound variables.
