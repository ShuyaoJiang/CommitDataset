Refactor SubscriptionRegistry

The SubscriptionRegistry and implementations are now in a package
together with SimpleBrokerWebMessageHandler and primarily support
with matching subscriptions to messages. Subscriptions can contain
patterns as supported by AntPathMatcher.

StopmWebSocketHandler no longer keeps track of subscriptions and simply
ignores messages without a subscription id, since it has no way of
knowing broker-specific destination semantics for patterns.
