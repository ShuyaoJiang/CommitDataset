Consolidate annotation processing constants

Consolidating internal bean name and aspect class name constats within
AnnotationConfigUtils to allow access from both the context.config
and context.annotation packages without creating a relationship between
the two of them (they are unrelated leaf nodes in the packaging
currently).

The .transaction module does not have a similar utils class and already
has a relationship from transaction.config -> transaction.annotation,
so placing the constants in .annotation.TransactionManagementCapability
to be referenced by .config.AnnotationDrivenBeanDefinitionParser
