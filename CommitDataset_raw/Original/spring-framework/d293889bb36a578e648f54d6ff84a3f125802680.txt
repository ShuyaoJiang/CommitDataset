Fix invalid PATH_WITHIN_HANDLER_MAPPING_ATTRIBUTE

Prior to this commit, `AntPathMatcher.extractPathWithinPattern` would
not process correctly `**` patterns and would only match *one* path
segment in the given path.

This commit changes `extractPathWithinPattern` to allow multiple path
segments to be matched against a single `**` pattern segment.

Issue: SPR-10515
