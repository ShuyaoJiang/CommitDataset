Allow PropertyResolvers to ignore unresolvable ${placeholders}

Prior to this commit, the PropertyResolver API (and therefore the
Environment API) allowed callers a choice between
 #resolvePlaceholders and #resolveRequiredPlaceholders for low-level
${placeholder} resolution. However, when calling the higher level
 #getProperty variants, users had no control over whether property
values returned with unresolvable ${placeholders} would result in an
exception or simply be passed through.

This commit introduces a #setIgnoreUnresolvableNestedPlaceholders
property via ConfigurablePropertyResolver, defaulting to false, the
value of which is respected by AbstractPropertyResolver#getProperty
method implementations. See the new test in
PropertySourcesPropertyResolverTests for usage examples.
