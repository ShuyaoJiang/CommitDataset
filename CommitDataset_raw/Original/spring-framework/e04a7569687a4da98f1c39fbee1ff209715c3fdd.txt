Support AntPathMatch URLs in URL ResultMatchers

Prior to this commit, one could only match exact URLs in redirectedUrl
and forwardedUrl ResultMatchers. When creating a resource with
a REST service, URLs often contain the id the new resource,
like "/resource/12".

This commit updates those ResultMatchers to support both
exact matches and AntPath matches, using new methods.
The former URL then can be tested against "/resource/*" in MVC tests.
