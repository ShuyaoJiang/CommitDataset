Revert "Support {/var} syntax in UriComponentsBuilder"

This reverts commit a57d42829ccd680b49faac18cb75bb3852554539 after the
realization of a weaknesses with the proposed approach.

For example if a path segment contains both a /-prefixed and a regular
URI variable, there is no way to split that into a sequence of path
and path segments. The solution will have to be on the side of
UriComponents at the time of encoding.
