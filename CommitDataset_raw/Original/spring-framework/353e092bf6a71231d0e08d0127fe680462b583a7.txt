Register EventPublishingTestExecutionListener by default (round 2)

This commit registers the EventPublishingTestExecutionListener as a
default TestExecutionListener with an order of 10,000. This registers
the EventPublishingTestExecutionListener as the last listener provided
by the Spring Framework.

With EventPublishingTestExecutionListener registered with an order of
10,000, it is effectively wrapped by all other Spring listeners,
including support for @DirtiesContext and test-managed transactions.

Furthermore, this commit revises the implementation of
EventPublishingTestExecutionListener to take advantage of the new
TestContext#hasApplicationContext() support which allows the
EventPublishingTestExecutionListener to publish events only if the
test's ApplicationContext is currently available. This avoids
undesirable side-effects such as eager loading of the
ApplicationContext before it is needed or re-loading of the
ApplicationContext after it has been intentionally closed.

Closes gh-18490
