Document socket timeout config limitations for HttpClient

This commit documents the difference between configuring the socket
timeout on the `RequestConfig` and on the `SocketConfig`.

The first one does not affect timeouts when establishing an SSL
connection or sending a CONNECT request to a proxy. For these use cases,
it is required to configure `SocketConfig` on the `HttpClient` instance
directly.
