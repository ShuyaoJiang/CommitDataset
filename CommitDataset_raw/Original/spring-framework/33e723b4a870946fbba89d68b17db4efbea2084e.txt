Fix AntPathMatcher rule for combining with extensions

Before this fix AntPathMatcher had a special rule for combining
patterns with wildcards and extensions as follows:

"/*.*"  + "/*.html" => "/*.html"

This change ensures this rule never applies if the first pattern
contains URI variables.

Issue: SPR-10062
