Support single quotes nested in double quotes in SQL scripts

Some databases such as Oracle permit double quoted column aliases that
contain case-sensitive characters, single quotes, and other special
characters; however, prior to this commit, SqlScripts interpreted a
single quote nested within double quotes as the start of a string
literal resulting in improper parsing.

This commit addresses this issue by ensuring that double quoted strings
such as column aliases are properly parsed even when containing single
quotes.

Issue: SPR-13218
