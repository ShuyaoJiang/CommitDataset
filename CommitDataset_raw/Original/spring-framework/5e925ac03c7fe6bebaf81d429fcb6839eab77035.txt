Rename header for "orig" destination

The UserDestinationMessageHandler adds a header providing a hint for
what the original destination a user may have used when subscribing.
That is then used when writing messages back to WebSocket clients to
ensure they dont see the internally used, transformed user destination.

This change moves the header name constatn to make it more broadly
applicable. For example SPR-11645.
