Introduce MessageHeader accessor types

A new type MessageHeaderAccesssor provides read/write access to
MessageHeaders along with typed getter/setter methods along the lines
of the existing MessageBuilder methods (internally MessageBuilder
merely delegates to MessageHeaderAccessor). This class is extensible
with sub-classes expected to provide typed getter/setter methods for
specific categories of message headers.

NativeMessageHeaderAccessor is one specific sub-class that further
provides read/write access to headers from some external message
source (e.g. STOMP headers). Native headers are stored in a separate
MultiValueMap and kept under a specific key.
