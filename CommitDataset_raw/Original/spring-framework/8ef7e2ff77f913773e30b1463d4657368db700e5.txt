Use Reactor 2.5 Flux and Mono Rx light API

Flux and Mono are used both for implementation and exposed at API
level to express 1 versus N semantic and to provide default Rx
operators:
- Flux<T> for multiple values Publisher (issue #48)
- Mono<T> for single value Publisher (issue #50)
- Mono<Void> for Publisher with no value (issue #49)
