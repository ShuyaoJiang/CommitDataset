Created SettableListenableFuture with tests

A SettableListenableFuture implementation of Spring's ListenableFuture
The class is inspired by Google Guavaâ€™s
com.google.common.util.concurrent.SettableFuture, but this
implementation uses ReentrantReadWriteLock and CountDownLatch
internally to handle thread synchronization.

Issue: SPR-11614
