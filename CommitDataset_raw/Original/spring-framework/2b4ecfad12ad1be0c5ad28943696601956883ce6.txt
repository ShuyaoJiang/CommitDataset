Upgrade to JUnit 4.11

This commit upgrades the compile dependency on JUnit in the spring-test
module as well as the global test dependency on JUnit for the entire
test suite to 4.11 GA.

In addition, the spring-test module now depends on junit:junit instead
of junit:junit-dep since, as of JUnit 4.11, the "junit" Maven artifact
no longer inlines hamcrest-core.

Issue: SPR-10044
