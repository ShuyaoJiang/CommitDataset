VersionResourceResolver should delegate to the chain

Prior to this commit, the `VersionResourceResolver` implementations of
`resolveUrlPathInternal` would delegate to the resolver chain but would
never use the give result if the current request didn't match a
configured version strategy pattern.

This is a problem if the resolver supposed to resolve the resource path
is configured after a `VersionResourceResolver` in the resolver chain;
this means that other resolver never gets to participate in the result
of the chain.

Issue: SPR-15372
