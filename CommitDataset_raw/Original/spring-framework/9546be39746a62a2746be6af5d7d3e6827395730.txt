Fix JavaDoc in OpMultiply so that it does not contain special characters

The JavaDoc in OpMultiply contained special characters that caused
problems when building with Java 7 on Mac OS X. The section symbol has
been replaced with the word "Section". Also improved class-level and
method-level JavaDoc in general.
