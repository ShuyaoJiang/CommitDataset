Enhance MessageHeaderAccessor support

Refine semantics of ID and TIMESTAMP headers provided to protected
MessageHeaders constructor.

Refactor internal implementation of MessageHeaderAccessor.

Support mutating headers from a single thread while a message is being
built (e.g. StompDecoder creating message + then adding session id).

Improve immutablity in NativeMessageHeaderAccessor and in
StompHeaderAccessor.

Optimize object creation for initializing messages and subsequent
accessing their headers.

Introduce MessageHeaderAccessorFactory support to enable applying a
common strategies for ID and TIMESTAMP generation to every message.

Add MessageBuilder shortcut factory method for creating messages from
payload and a full-prepared MessageHeaders instance. Also add
equivalent constructors to GenericMessage and ErrorMessage.
