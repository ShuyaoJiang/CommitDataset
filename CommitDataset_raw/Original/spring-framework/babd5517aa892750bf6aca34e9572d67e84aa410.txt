Revert ParsingPathMatcher concurrency checks

`PathPatternParser` is now thread-safe and creates a new internal parser
for each `parse` call, since this operation is cheap.
This commit removes the `ThreadLocal` based instances of
`PathPatternParser` in `ParsingPathMatcher` which are not required
anymore.

Issue: SPR-15246
