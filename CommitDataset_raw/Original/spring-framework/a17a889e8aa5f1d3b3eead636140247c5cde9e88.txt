Make 'Content-Disposition' header case insensitive

Previously 'Content-Disposition' was passed to Part.getHeader(String).
However the Javadoc for that method specifies the header should be
case insensitive. Note that the JavaDoc in tomcat-servlet-api doesn't
mention this. It can only be found in the official api JavaDoc:
