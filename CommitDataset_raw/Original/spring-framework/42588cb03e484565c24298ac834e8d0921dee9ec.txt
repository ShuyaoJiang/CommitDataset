Prepare Undertow 1.3.0 compatibility

Xnio 3.4.0 will introduce a new source of ByteBuffers: ByteBufferPool.
Previously this feature was offered by Pooled/Pool/ByteBufferSlicePool;
those classes are now marked as deprecated.

As of 1.3.0.Beta9, Undertow still implements the following method in its
ClientConnection interface, using those deprecated types:

    Pool<ByteBuffer> getBufferPool();

This commit prepares compatibility by suppressing warnings in order to
avoid build failures in our build. Once appropriate changes are made in
Undertow, a specific implementation with new types could be introduced.

Issue: SPR-13366
