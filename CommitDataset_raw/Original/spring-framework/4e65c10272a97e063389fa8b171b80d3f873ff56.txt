Fix broken test in SpringJUnit4ConcurrencyTests

Prior to this commit, SpringJUnit4ConcurrencyTests was broken due to
recent additions of test methods in SampleTests.

This commit fixes the broken test by removing hard coded constants and
replacing them with dynamic lookups for JUnit 4 @Test methods.
