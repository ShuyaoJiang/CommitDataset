ResourceWebHandler signals error for missing resources

Prior to this commit, the `ResourceWebHandler` would itself handle the
response with an HTTP 404 in many cases, including a missing static
resource.

This does not give a chance to `WebExceptionHandler` instances to handle
that error and, for example, display an error page.
