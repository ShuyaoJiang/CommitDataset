RedirectViews should always use RESPONSE_STATUS_ATTRIBUTE

By default, RedirectViews have http10Compatible set to true, which means
that they use HTTP 302 as a default HTTP response status. Setting this
property to false make RedirectViews use HTTP 303 by default.

Now when set to false, RedirectViews also don't use the
RESPONSE_STATUS_ATTRIBUTE request attribute as a response HTTP if it is
available.

This commit makes both configuration choices behave the same regarding
this request attribute: use it as a response status if it's available.
