HtmlUnitRequestBuilder decodes parameter names

Previously HtmlUnitRequestBuilder did not decode parameter names. This
means if a parameter like row[0] was submittted it would be encoded as
row%5B0%5D When the HttpServletRequest was created the parameter name would
not be decoded so the parameter name row[0] would not be found.

This commit ensures that HTTP parameter names are decoded.
