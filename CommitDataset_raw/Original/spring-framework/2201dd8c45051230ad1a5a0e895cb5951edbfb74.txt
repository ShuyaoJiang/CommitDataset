Add support for matrix variables

A new @MatrixVariable annotation allows injecting matrix variables
into @RequestMapping methods. The matrix variables may appear in any
path segment and should be wrapped in a URI template for request
mapping purposes to ensure request matching is not affected by the
order or the presence/absence of such variables. The @MatrixVariable
annotation has an optional "pathVar" attribute that can be used to
refer to the URI template where a matrix variable is located.

Previously, ";" (semicolon) delimited content was removed from the
path used for request mapping purposes. To preserve backwards
compatibility that continues to be the case (except for the MVC
namespace and Java config) and may be changed by setting the
"removeSemicolonContent" property of RequestMappingHandlerMapping to
"false". Applications using the  MVC namespace and Java config do not
need to do anything further to extract and use matrix variables.
