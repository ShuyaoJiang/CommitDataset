Upgrade to Gradle 1.0-rc1

 - Fix deprecation warnings about dynamic properties; favor use of
   "extra properties extensions" per [1]

 - Certain such deprecations are still issued due to violations within
   the docbook-reference plugin. These will be fixed in an upcoming
   revision of the plugin, at which point spring-framework will upgrade
   to depend on it and these warnings will be eliminated
