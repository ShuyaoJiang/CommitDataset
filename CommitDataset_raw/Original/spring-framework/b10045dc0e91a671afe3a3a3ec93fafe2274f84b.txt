Do not execute ResourceUrlEncodingFilter only once per request

In case the filter is also registered to the ERROR dispatcher, the
following happens:
* the filter is executed once for the regular execution
* the filter should be executed a second time when dispatched to error

Since the filter is a `OncePerRequestFilter`, the filter is only
executed once and won't be executed when handling the error.

This can lead to situations like spring-projects/spring-boot#7348

This commit makes this filter a simple `GenericFilterBean`.
