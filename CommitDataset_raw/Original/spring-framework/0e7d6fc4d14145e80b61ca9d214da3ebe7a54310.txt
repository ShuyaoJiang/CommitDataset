Rename WebClient.ResponseSpec.bodyToEntity[List] to toEntity[List]

This commit renames `WebClient.ResponseSpec.bodyToEntity` to `toEntity`
and similarly renames `WebClient.ResponseSpec.bodyToEntityList` to
`toEntityList`. In both cases, the `body` prefix was dropped because the
return value contains more than the body.

Issue: SPR-15486
