Harmonize log configuration

Prior to this commit, the codebase was using a mix of log4j.xml
and log4j.properties for test-related logging configuration. This
can be an issue as log4j takes the xml variant first when looking
for a default bootstrap configuration.

In practice, some modules declaring the properties variant were
taking the xml variant configuration from another module.

The general structure of the configuration has also been
harmonized to provide a standard console output as well as an
easy way to enable trace logs for the current module.
