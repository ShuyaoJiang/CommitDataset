Generate eclipse project settings from gradle

Update gradle to generate the following project specific eclipse
settings:

- Java formatting
- Cleanup options
- Warning settings
- Code template with copyright header
- WTP module meta-data

In addition this commit changes the eclipse project .classpath file
to output test and main classes to different folders. This is required
to prevent eclipse WTP from packaging test classes into /WEB-INF/lib
jar files.
