Flush of underlying response in ContentCachingResponseWrapper

Prior to this commit, when adding a ShallowEtagHeaderFilter to an
application, the ServletResponse would be wrapped by a
ContentCachingResponseWrapper. When any part of the Spring
infrastructure calls `flushBuffer` on the wrapped response, the call is
delegated to the actual response, which is committed. It's not possible
to alter the response (headers, content) anymore - the ETag filter can't
act.

This change prevents the `flushBuffer` call to be delegated and only
commits the underlying response once the cached content is copied to the
actual response stream.

Issue: SPR-13717
