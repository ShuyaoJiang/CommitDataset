Use the official SonarQube Gradle plugin

Since the build has been upgraded to Gradle 2.10, it's showing the
following message:
"The 'sonar-runner' plugin has been deprecated and is scheduled to be
removed in Gradle 3.0. please use the official plugin from SonarQube"

This commit makes use of the "org.sonarqube" Gradle plugin and uprgrades
the Jacoco agent version to 0.7.5.
