Add support for WebFilter and WebExceptionHandler

This commit adds support for configuring `WebFilter` and
`WebExceptionHandler` instances in HandlerStrategies. It also drops the
"native" support for `ResponseStatusException`s, in favor of the
`ResponseStatusExceptionHandler`, which is registered by default.
