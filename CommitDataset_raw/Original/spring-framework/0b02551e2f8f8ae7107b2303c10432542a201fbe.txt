Update resource handler Java config

This change separates out resource chain related methods previously in
ResourceHandlerRegistration into a new class ResourceChainRegistration
with the goal of improving readability.

Along with that, the registration of caching resolver and transformer
is now explicitly controled with a boolean flag (on the method used
to obtain the ResourceChainRegistration) and an overloaded method
also allows providing a Cache instance.

Issue: SPR-12124
