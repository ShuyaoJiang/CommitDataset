Fix package list URL for Reactor javadoc in Dokka

Reactor is now building its Javadoc with a recent JDK version, which
changes the structure of the published HTML pages.

Without this change, the build fails during the Dokka generation with
the following exception:

```
Exception while loading package-list from
ExternalDocumentationLinkImpl(
  url=http://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/,
  packageListUrl=http://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/package-list)
```

This commit now points to the `/element-list` page, which seems to
contain the same information as the `package-list` page.
