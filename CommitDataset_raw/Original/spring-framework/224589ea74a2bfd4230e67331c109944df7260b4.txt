Remove write pausing in Undertow response

Using the simple example shown in the ticket but switching from
Mono<String> to Flux<String> (and 5,000,000 onNext calls) shows that
constant pausing causes significant overhead and is not worth the
trouble vs ignoring the onWritePossible in REQUESTED state.
