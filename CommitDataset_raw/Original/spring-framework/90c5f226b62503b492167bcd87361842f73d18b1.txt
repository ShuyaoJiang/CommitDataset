Fix package cycles in spring-test

Code introduced in conjunction with SPR-5243 introduced package cycles
between the ~.test.context.web and ~.test.context.support packages. This
was caused by the fact that ServletTestExecutionListener extended
AbstractTestExecutionListener.

To address this, ServletTestExecutionListener now implements
TestExecutionListener directly.

Issue: SPR-9924
