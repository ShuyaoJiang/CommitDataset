Find exact matches in WebJarsResourceResolver

Prior to this commit, resolving resources from webjars using the
`WebJarAssetLocator.getFullPath` could lead to multiple candidates,
since this method is trying to find *any* resource matching that path
under the given webjar location.

This commit replaces that call with
`WebJarAssetLocator.getFullPathExact`, which avoids those multiple
matches and only resolves resources if the given path is exact.
