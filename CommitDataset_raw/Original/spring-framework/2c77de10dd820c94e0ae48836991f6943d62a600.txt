Fix X-Forwarded-* behavior in ServletUriComponentsBuilder

When using ServletUriComponentsBuilder.fromRequest, this change
makes sure that:
* the default port is used when the "X-Forwarded-Host" header is set
and no port is defined in that header value
* to use the scheme defined in the "X-Forwarded-Proto" header if set
