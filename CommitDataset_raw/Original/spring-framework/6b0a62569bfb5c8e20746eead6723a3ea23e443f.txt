Fix broken test in MvcNamespaceTests

The testDefaultConfig() method in MvcNamespaceTests creates a new Date()
in its test fixture but then performs an assertion against a hard coded
data string of "2013-10-21". This test therefore only passed yesterday,
on October 21, 2013.

This commit addresses this by changing the hard coded date string to one
based on the current date.
