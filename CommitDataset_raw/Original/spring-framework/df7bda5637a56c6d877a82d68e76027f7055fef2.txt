Constrain targets for @Filter declaration

For clarity, add @Target({}) to definition of @Filter, constraining it
to complex annotation composition only; i.e. it cannot be placed on
any element, only within annotations, e.g.

    @ComponentScan(includeFilters=@Filter(...))

is legal, while

    @Filter
    public class MyType { }

is not.

Also, widen @Retention from SOURCE to RUNTIME, even though it is not
technically necessary, as all parsing of @Filter annotations happens via
ASM, i.e. at the source level.  This change is made primarily for
consistency (@ComponentScan's Retention is RUNTIME) and in avoidance of
potential confusion or surprise on the part of those casually browsing
the code.
