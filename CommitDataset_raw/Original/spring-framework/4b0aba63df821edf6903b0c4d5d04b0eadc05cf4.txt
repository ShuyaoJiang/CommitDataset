Default JmsListenerContainerFactory lookup

Prior to this commit, the default JmsListenerContainerFactory to use
must be explicitly set. Since having a single container factory is a
fairly common use case, we look up the default one automatically
using the bean name "jmsListenerContainerFactory".

It is still possible to provide an explicit default but since it refers
more to "the" container factory to use, the parameter has been
renamed to "containerFactory" which is shorter and more explicit.

The lookup strategy is lazy: if all endpoints are providing an
explicit container factory and no container factory with the
"jmsListenerContainerFactory" bean name exists, no exception
will be thrown.

Issue : SPR-11706
