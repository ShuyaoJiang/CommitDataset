Fix package cycles in spring-test

Code introduced in conjunction with SPR-5243 introduced package cycles
between the ~.test.context and ~.test.context.web packages. This was
caused by the fact that ContextLoaderUtils worked directly with the
@WebAppConfiguration and WebMergedContextConfiguration types.

To address this, the following methods have been introduced in
ContextLoaderUtils. These methods use reflection to circumvent hard
dependencies on the @WebAppConfiguration and
WebMergedContextConfiguration types.

 - loadWebAppConfigurationClass()
 - buildWebMergedContextConfiguration()
