Refactor tests to use the new database-name attribute

This commit refactors the XML configuration used by the tests in the
Spr8849Tests test suite so that a unique database name is always
generated (via the new 'database-name' attribute that was introduced in
SPR-12835) while reusing the same bean name (i.e., 'dataSource').

This is a much more robust alternative to the previous work-around
since the name of the DataSource does not randomly change across
application contexts, thus allowing proper autowiring by name and bean
referencing within XML configuration.

Issue: SPR-8849
