Remove BodyInserters.fromServerSentEvent variants

Removed superfluous `fromServerSentEvent` variants from `BodyInserters`,
as their functionality can also be obtained by passing a stream of
strings or POJOs (to be encoded as JSON) to
`fromPublisher(Publisher, Class)}`, and specifying a `text/event-stream`
Content-Type.
