Force lazy-init to false when parsing scheduled:task

A <scheduled:task> element declared within a
<beans default-lazy-init="true"> element represents a contradiction in
terms: such a task will never be executed.

For this reason, we now override any inherited lazy-init settings
when parsing <scheduled:task> elements, forcing lazy-init to false
for the underlying ScheduledTaskRegistrar bean.

Thanks to Mike Youngstrom for contributing an initial patch.
