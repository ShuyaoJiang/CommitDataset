Restore *.aj whitespace

The removal of whitespace to the *.aj files made in 1762157 cause
NoSuchMethodError for code compiled against previous versions of
spring-aspects due to a bug in AspectJ (see SPR-10178 for details).

This commit reverts all the whitespace changes made in 1762157 which
resolves the NoSuchMethodErrors.
