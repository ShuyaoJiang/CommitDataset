Fix SockJS origin check

This commit introduces the following changes:
 - Requests without Origin header are not rejected anymore
 - Disable Iframe when allowedOrigins is not empty and not equals to *
 - The Iframe is not cached anymore in order to have a reliable origin check
 - allowedOrigins must not be null or empty
 - allowedOrigins format is now validated (should be * or start by http(s)://)
