Remove assertion on number of resource locations

With the new ResourceResolver abstraction and resource resolver chain
in 4.1, the assumption that resources are found by checking for the URL
path under the configured locations is no longer accurate.

A custom ResourceResolver could find resources in ways that don't
depend on a list of locations.
