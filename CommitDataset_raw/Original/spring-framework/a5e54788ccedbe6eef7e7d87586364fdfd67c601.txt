Remove PathPatternComparator

Direct comparison of a pattern (as a String) to the path does not make
much sense now that we deal with URL encoding through PathContainer
which exposes (safely) decoded path segments.

Removing the PathPatternComparator also means we can keep patterns
pre-sorted instead of sorting them all the time. That probably offsets
any benefits from comparing to the lookup path for direct matches and
patterns are still sorted according to specificity.
