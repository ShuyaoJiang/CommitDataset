Improve WebSession related tests

Add missing DefaultWebSessionManagerTests .block(). Previously
session.save() was invoked, but we did not ensure it was completed.
This commit makes it block on session.save()

Fix existingSessionIsExpired. This test is actually broken and is
testing a new session is created because the session id returned
by the idResolver does not match the existing WebSession.
This commit ensures that the id of the WebSession found by idResolver
matches the existing WebSession.

DefaultWebSessionManagerTests use Mockito. To ensure we test with
independence from InMemoryWebSessionStore we use Mockito for the
DefaultWebessionManager collaborators.

Add test for response.setComplete(). We want to ensure that when the
response is completed, it saves the WebSession and writes it to the
response using idResolver
