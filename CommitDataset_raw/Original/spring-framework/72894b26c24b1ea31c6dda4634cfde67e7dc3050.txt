Fix conversion of Message<?> payload for replies

If a custom MessageConverter is set, it is not used for replies defined
via the Message abstraction. This commit harmonizes the behaviour of the
`MessagingMessageConverter` so that the conversion of the payload can
be converted for both incoming and outgoing messages.
