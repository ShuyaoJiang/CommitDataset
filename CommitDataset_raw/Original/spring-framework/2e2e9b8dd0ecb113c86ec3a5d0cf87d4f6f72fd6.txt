Improve support for @Conditional on @Configuration

Introduce new ConfigurationCondition interface allowing more
fine-grained control for @Conditional when used with @Configuration
beans.

Primarily added so that the evaluation of conditions that inspect bean
definitions can be deferred until all @Configuration classes have been
parsed.
