Allow modifying HandshakeInterceptor list

The getter in TransportHandlingSockJsService now returns a mutable
List. The immutable wrapper doesn't make sense since it's possible
anyway to modify the list by creating a new list and calling the
setter again. It's also consistent with the same field on
WebSocketHttpRequestHandler.

This is related to work for SPR-12845.
