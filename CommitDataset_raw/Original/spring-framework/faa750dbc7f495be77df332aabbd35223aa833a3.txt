Generate reference docs with docbook-gradle-plugin

The docbook-gradle-plugin has been custom-developed specifically to
handle Spring projects. It is highly opinionated, and not terribly
configurable in its current form. Sources and documentation are
available via the 'gradle-plugins' github repository at

    https://github.com/cbeams/gradle-plugins

Note that this repository may soon move locations to the SpringSource
GitHub organization, in which case the url will be

    https://github.com/SpringSource/gradle-plugins

In any case, the build plans for these plugins can be found at

    https://build.springsource.org/browse/GRADLEPLUGINS
