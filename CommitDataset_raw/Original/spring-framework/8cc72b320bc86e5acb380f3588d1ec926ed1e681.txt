View resolution with content negotiation

ViewResolutionResultHandler and ResponseBodyResultHandler now share
a common base class ContentNegotiatingResultHandlerSupport that
supports content negotiation.

For view resolution we compare against the supported media types of
resolved View instances, which may include default View's delegating
to an HttpMessageConverter (e.g. JSON, XML, rendering).
