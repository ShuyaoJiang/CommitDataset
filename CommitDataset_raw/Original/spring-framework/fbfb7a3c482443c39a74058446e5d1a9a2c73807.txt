Add PathResourceResolver conditionally

The ResourceHandlerRegistration now checks if the last resolver is an
instance of PathResourceResolver and if so it skips adding it.

This change also creates and adds the VersionResourceResolver (as well
as CssLinkTransformer) the first time any VersionStrategy is
registered. This ensures that custom resolvers (including an extension
of PathResourceResolver) may be added both before and after the
VersionResourceResolver.

Lastly this change renames addVersion and addVersionHash to be
consistent with addVersionStrategy.
