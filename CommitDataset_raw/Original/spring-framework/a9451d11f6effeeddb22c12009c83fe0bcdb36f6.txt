Relax -aspects dependence on -test (compile=>test)

The spring-aspects Maven pom had an incorrect compile-scoped dependence
on spring-test. In fact, spring-aspects only uses spring-test in its
unit tests. The pom has been updated accordingly, meaning that use
of spring-aspects in Maven-based applications will no longer require
spring-test on the classpath at runtime.

ivy.xml metadata did not need updating, as it was already correct.

This change is only necessary on the 3.1.x line; in 3.2.x (master) Maven
poms are generated automatically from Gradle dependency metadata, which
is also already correct.
