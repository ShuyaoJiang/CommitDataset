Require aopalliance dependency for spring-aop

A recent commit made aopalliance optional for spring-aop, while
continuing to require it for spring-tx. On review, this is probably
overly aggressive, and for convenience aopalliance should remain
required for spring-aop. There are use cases for which aopalliance is
indeed optional, but core functionality such as <aop:scoped-proxy>
should never result in a ClassNotFoundException.

This commit returns the aopalliance dependency for spring-aop to
required status, and also explicitly notes the same dependency in other
modules that compile directly against aopalliance types.

Issue: SPR-9501
