Improve JettySockJsIntegrationTests to show real error

In a recent CI build failure a test timed out waiting for a message:
https://build.spring.io/browse/SPR-PUB-1316

In fact there was a WebSocket transport failure originating in Jetty's
WebSocket Parser. However this failure is only apparent by looking at
the logs. This change adds a check if a transport error ocurred while
we were waiting and throws an AssertionError.
