Support searches for multiple merged composed annotations

Prior to this commit it was possible to search for the 1st merged
annotation above an annotated element. It was also possible to search
for annotation attributes aggregated from all annotations above an
annotated element; however, it was impossible to search for all
composed annotations above an annotated element and have the results as
synthesized merged annotations instead of a multi-map of attributes.

This commit introduces a new findAllMergedAnnotations() method in
AnnotatedElementUtils that finds all annotations of the specified type
within the annotation hierarchy above the supplied element. For each
such annotation found, it merges that annotation's attributes with
matching attributes from annotations in lower levels of the annotation
hierarchy and synthesizes the results back into an annotation of the
specified type. All such merged annotations are collected and returned
as a set.
