Doc. usage of JSR-250 lifecycle annotations in TCF

The reference manual previously did not mention the applicability of
JSR-250 lifecycle annotations within the TestContext framework. The
lacking documentation here has lead to misunderstandings of the support
provided for @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy in test classes.

The testing chapter of the reference manual has therefore been updated
to explicitly define the limited support for these annotations.

Also introduced Jsr250LifecycleTests for empirical verification of the 
expected behavior.
