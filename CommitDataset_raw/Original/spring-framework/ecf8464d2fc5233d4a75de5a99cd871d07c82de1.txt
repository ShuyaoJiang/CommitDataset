Replace MaxPermSize use in build scripts

Since JDK 8 is required to build Spring framework 4, and permanent
generation is gone from Java 8, to eliminate warnings about no longer
available MaxPermSize switch, it should be removed or replaced with new
MaxMetaspaceSize switch.

This fix replaces old with new switch to limit the amount of native
memory used for class metadata.

Issue: SPR-10571
