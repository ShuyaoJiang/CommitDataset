Refactored SseEvent to ServerSentEvent

 - Renamed SseEvent to ServerSentEvent to make the name less redundant.
 - ServerSentEvent is now immutable, having a builder to create new instances.
 - Realigned the class properties to more closely match the events
   described in the spec, so that `reconnectTime` becomes `retry`, and
   `name` becomes `event`.
