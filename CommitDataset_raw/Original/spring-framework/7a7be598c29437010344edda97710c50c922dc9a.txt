Clean up spring-jdbc tests warnings

Clean up compiler warnings in the tests of spring-jdbc. This commit
adds type parameters to all the types (mostly `List` and `Map`). In
addition it uses Java 5 autoboxing to get rid of all of the following

 * new Integer
 * new Long
 * new Float
 * new Double
 * new Boolean
 * new String

This should be unnoticeably faster since interning can be uses for
Integer and such.

After this commit the only warnings in spring-jdbc left are:

* raw type warning in `MapDataSourceLookupTests`, that code would never
  compile with generics
* deprecation warning for `#queryForInt` and `#queryForLong`
