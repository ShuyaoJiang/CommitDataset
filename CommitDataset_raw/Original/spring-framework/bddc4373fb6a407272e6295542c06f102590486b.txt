Refactor ObjectToObjectConverter & improve exception msg

- The exception message now mentions lacking to-Object method as well.

- Documented explicit lacking support for toString() for conversions.

- Introduced dedicated has*() methods for greater clarity and to reduce
  code duplication.

- Static factory methods (i.e., of, from, valueOf) are now supported for
  conversion to a String.
