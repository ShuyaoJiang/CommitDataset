Update ViewResolver registration classes

Following the separation of FreeMarker/Velocity/TilesConfigurer-related
configuration via separate interface, simplify and streamline the
view registration helper classes which no longer have much difference
(most are UrlBasedViewResolver's).

Updates to Javadoc and tests.

Issue: SPR-7093
