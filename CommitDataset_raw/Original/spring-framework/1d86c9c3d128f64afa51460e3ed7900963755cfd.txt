Use Credentials object instead of 2 attributes for Basic Authentication

This commit changes the usage of two separate attributes (username and
password) into one: a single `Credentials` object.
Additionally, the attributes key under which the credentials are stored
is changed to be specific to Basic Authentication, in order to allow for
other sorts of authentication later.
