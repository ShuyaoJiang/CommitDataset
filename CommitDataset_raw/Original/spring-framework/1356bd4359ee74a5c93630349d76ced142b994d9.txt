Share HandlerInterceptors in ResourceHandlerMapping

Prior to this commit, the Resource `HandlerMapping` configured by
`@EnableSpringMvc` would be set up with only one custom
`HandlerInterceptor` (the one exposing the `ResourceUrlProvider` for
resolving URLs of static resources).

This behavior is not consistent with the rest of the default
configuration which leverages the interceptors configured against the
interceptor registry (with possible user-provided ones).

This change allows to register interceptors against resource handling;
this can be useful for metrics purposes, as in
spring-projects/spring-boot#10335.
