Add an option to set an Origin whitelist for Websocket and SockJS

This commit introduces a new OriginHandshakeInterceptor. It filters
Origin header value against a list of allowed origins.

AbstractSockJsService as been modified to:
 - Reject CORS requests with forbidden origins
 - Disable transport types that does not support CORS when an origin
   check is required
 - Use the Origin request header value instead of "*" for
   Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header value
   (mandatory when  Access-Control-Allow-Credentials=true)
 - Return CORS header only if the request contains an Origin header

It is possible to configure easily this behavior thanks to JavaConfig API
WebSocketHandlerRegistration#addAllowedOrigins(String...) and
StompWebSocketEndpointRegistration#addAllowedOrigins(String...).
It is also possible to configure it using the websocket XML namespace.

Please notice that this commit does not change the default behavior:
cross origin requests are still enabled by default.
