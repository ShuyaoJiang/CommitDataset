Support optional trailing separator on path pattern matching

This commit adds the ability for path patterns to automatically
match a trailing separator (so there is no need to add two
variants of a pattern, one with and one without). This behaviour
is currently turned off but a simple tweak in PathPatternParser
can make it the default. If made default other parts of Spring
may need altering (simplifying hopefully) to cope with this.

Issue: SPR-15260
