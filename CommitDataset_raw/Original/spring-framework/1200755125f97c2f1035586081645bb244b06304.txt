Fix issue with subscribe destination

The original fix for SPR-11423:
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/32e5f57e647022d9ea82c03670936bf31f8467de

was insufficient when using an external broker since the original
destination header has to be in the "native headers" map (i.e. with
STOMP headers) in order to be included in messages broadcast by
the broker.
