Preserve comments when using JibxMarshaller

Prior to this commit, JibxMarshaller used a SAX ContentHandler to
marshal to StAX XMLEventWriters, which inadvertently resulted in the
deletion of XML comments.

After this commit, JibxMarshaller adapts the XMLEventWriter into an
XMLStreamWriter and comments are preserved.
