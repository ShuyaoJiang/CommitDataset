Support proxied objects in ReflectionTestUtils

This commit adds support for unwrapping proxies in the setField() and
getField() methods in ReflectionTestUtils.

Instead of always accessing fields directly on the supplied
targetObject (which may be a proxy), AopTestUtils is now used to obtain
the potential ultimateTargetObject which is then used for accessing
fields.

Issue: SPR-14050
