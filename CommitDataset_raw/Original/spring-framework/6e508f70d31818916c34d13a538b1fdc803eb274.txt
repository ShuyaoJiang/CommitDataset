Add locking to AbstractRequestExpectationManager

This commit ensures that verifying a request, which includes finding
and updating expectations, is done synchronously to avoid concurrent
modification exceptions.

Technically SimpleRequestExpectationManager is not even expected to see
concurrent requests by definition but with
UnorderedRequestExpectationManager it can happen.
