MimeTypeUtils uses SecureRandom

The prevailing current wisdom is to use the default constructor for
secure and let it pick the best algorithm for the OS.

On Java 8 (Oracle), Linux this results in "NativePRNG" which uses
/dev/random (potentially blocking) for the initial seed, and
/dev/urandom (non-blocking) for subsequent calls to nextInt.
