Consolidate websocket/messaging code

Before this change spring-messaging contained a few WebSocket-related
classes including WebSocket sub-protocol support for STOMP as well
as @EnableWebSocketMessageBroker and related configuration classes.

After this change those classes are located in the spring-websocket
module under org.springframework.web.socket.messaging.

This means the following classes in application configuration must
have their packages updated:

org.springframework.web.socket.messaging.config.EnableWebSocketMessageBroker
org.springframework.web.socket.messaging.config.StompEndpointRegistry
org.springframework.web.socket.messaging.config.WebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer

MessageBrokerConfigurer has been renamed to MessageBrokerRegistry and
is also located in the above package.
