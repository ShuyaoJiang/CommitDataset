Only print request/response body if char enc is present in MVC Test

Commit e65a1a4372 introduced support in PrintingResultHandler for only
printing the request or response body in the Spring MVC Test framework
if the content type is known to be text-based (e.g., plain text, HTML,
XHTML, XML, JSON, etc.). For unknown content types the body is assumed
to be text-based and is therefore always printed. The latter behavior,
however, is undesirable since the content may in fact not be text-based.

This commit addresses this issue by making the printing of the request
or response body an opt-in feature. Specifically, if a character
encoding has been set, the request or response body will be printed by
the PrintingResultHandler. Note, however, that the character encoding
is set to ISO-8859-1 in MockHttpServletResponse by default.

In addition, MockHttpServletRequest's getContentAsString() method now
throws an IllegalStateException if the character encoding has not been
set.

Issue: SPR-14776
