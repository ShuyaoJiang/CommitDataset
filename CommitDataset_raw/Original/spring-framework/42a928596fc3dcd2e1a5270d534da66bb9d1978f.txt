Remove tiles-request-servlet-wildcard dependency

The tiles-request-servlet-wildcard contained only one class that is an
implementation of the tiles-request ServletApplicationContext using a
Spring ApplicationContext to look up resources. It makes sense for this
class to be part of the Spring Tiles 3 integration.

Issue: SPR-10054
