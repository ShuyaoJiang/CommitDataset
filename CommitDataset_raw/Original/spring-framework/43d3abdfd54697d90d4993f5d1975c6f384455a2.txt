Fix SockJs CorsConfiguration for forbidden origins

After this commit, AbstractSockJsService uses the configured allowed
origins when generating the CorsConfiguration instead of "*".

As a consequence, forbidden origin requests still result in a 403
response but now with no CORS headers in order to improve consistency
between the status code and the headers.

Issue: SPR-16304
