Deregister @Configuration CGLIB callbacks

CGLIB-enhanced @Configuration subclasses now implement DisposableBean
such that Enhancer.registerStaticCallbacks(subclass, null) is invoked
on container shutdown. This ensures that garbage collection can work
properly and avoids memory consumption issues for applications that
create and destroy many application contexts within the same JVM.

Issue: SPR-7901
