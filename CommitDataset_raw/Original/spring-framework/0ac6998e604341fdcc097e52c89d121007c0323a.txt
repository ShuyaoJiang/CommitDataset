Refine destination semantics for msg-handling methods

After this change, annotated message handling methods configured to use
a destination prefix (e.g. "/app") no longer have to include the prefix
in their mapping. For example if a client sends a message to "/app/foo"
the annotated methods should be mapped with @MessageMapping("/foo").
