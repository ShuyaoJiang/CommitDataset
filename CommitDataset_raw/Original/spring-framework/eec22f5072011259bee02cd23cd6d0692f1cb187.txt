Avoid duplicate flush when closing outputstream

Prior to this commit, the `HttpInvokerServiceExporter` would close
its `ObjectOutputStream`, which itself issues duplicate flushes on the
underlying `OutputStream`. Duplicate flushes can lead to multiple,
separate TCP packets where those should be gathered writes.

This commit wraps the underying stream with a decorator that guards
against flush calls that are duplicated with the one done in `close`.
