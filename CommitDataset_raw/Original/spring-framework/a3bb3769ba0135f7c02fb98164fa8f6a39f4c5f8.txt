Tighten FlashMapManager for use with alternative storage options

Ensure that both FlashMapManager methods - the one invoked at the
start of a request and the one invoked before a redirect, update
the underlying storage fully since it's not guaranteed that both
will be invoked on any given request.

Also move the logic to remove expired FlashMap instances to the
metohd invoked at the start of a request to ensure the check is
made frequently enough.
