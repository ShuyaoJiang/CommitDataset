Only register Date converters with global format

Change JodaTimeFormatterRegistrar and DateFormatterRegistrar to only
register converters for the Date and Calendar types when a global format
has been defined. This means that the ObjectToObject converter will
handle String->Date conversion using the deprecated Date(String)
constructor (as was the case with Spring 3.1).
