Remove JMXMP from TestGroup

Due to the changes in a7425c81c000cd385417f0626759b3efc070c10b, we no
longer need to execute tests using the JMXMP protocol in PERFORMANCE
builds.

This commit removes the JMXMP constant from the TestGroup enum and
updates affected tests, thereby effectively including such tests in
the standard build from now on.
