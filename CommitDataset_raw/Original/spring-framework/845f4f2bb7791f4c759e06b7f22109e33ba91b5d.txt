Improve attribute alias support in @ComponentScan

Prior to this commit, @ComponentScan already had a value/basePackages
alias pair; however, the semantics were not properly enforced.

This commit addresses this issue by refactoring
ComponentScanAnnotationParser to ensure that it is not possible to
declare both of the aliased attributes. In addition, the 'value' and
'basePackages' attributes are now annotated with @AliasFor in order to
make the semantics clearer.

Issue: SPR-11393
