Leverage PathPatternParser in CORS configuration source

Previously `UrlBasedCorsConfigurationSource` was relying on
`PathMatcher` implementations for matching incoming request lookup paths
with the configured path patterns for CORS configuration.

This commit replaces the use of `PathMatcher` with a `PathPatternParser`
that parses the string patterns into `PathPattenr` instances and allows
for faster matching against lookup paths.
