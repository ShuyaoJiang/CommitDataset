Remove Gradle Daemon JVM args compatible with JDK 9

This commit reverts the changes made in 7bc44a9 so that developers who
do not use the Gradle daemon are not adversely affected by the explicit
JVM args that were introduced in that commit.

Developers who wish to run the build against JDK 9 with the Gradle
daemon can add the following to the gradle.properties file in their
'gradle user home' directory (e.g., ~/.gradle/gradle.properties):

    org.gradle.daemon=true
    org.gradle.jvmargs=-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=1024m -Xmx1024m
