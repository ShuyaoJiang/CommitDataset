Consistent descriptions for ConfigurationClass

Previously, a ConfigurationClass created from AnnotationMetadata
and a ConfigurationClass created from a class would have subtly
different descriptions. Given a class named com.example.Foo, the
former’s description would be “com.example.Foo”, whereas the latter’s
description would be “class com.example.Foo”.

This commit updates ConfigurationClass to make the description
consistent, preferring the description without “class” in it.

Closes gh-970
