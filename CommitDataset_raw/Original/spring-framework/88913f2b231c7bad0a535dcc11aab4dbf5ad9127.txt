Convert CRLF (dos) to LF (unix)

Prior to this change, roughly 5% (~300 out of 6000+) of files under the
source tree had CRLF line endings as opposed to the majority which have
LF endings.

This change normalizes these files to LF for consistency going forward.

Command used:

$ git ls-files | xargs file | grep CRLF | cut -d":" -f1 | xargs dos2unix

Issue: SPR-5608
