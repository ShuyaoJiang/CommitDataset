Enable smart suffix pattern match for request mapping

Following the introduction of ContentNegotiationManager that allows,
among other things, to configure the file extensions to use for content
negotiation, this change adds "smart" suffix pattern match that matches
against the configured file extensions only rather than against any
extension.

Given the request mapping "/jobs/{jobName}" and one configured file
extension ("json"), a request for "/jobs/my.job" will select the
pattern "/jobs/{jobName}" while a request for "/jobs/my.job.json" will
select the pattern "/jobs/{jobName}.json". Previously, both requests
would have resulted in the pattern "/jobs/{jobName}.*".
