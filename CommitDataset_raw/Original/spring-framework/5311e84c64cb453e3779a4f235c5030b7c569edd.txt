Added XStream CatchAllConverter

Added XStream CatchAllConverter that supports all classes, but throws
exceptions for (un)marshalling.

Main purpose of this class is to register this converter as a catchall
last converter with a normal or higher priority in addition to
converters that explicitly  support the domain classes that should be
supported. As a result, default XStream  converters with lower
priorities and possible security vulnerabilities do not get invoked.
