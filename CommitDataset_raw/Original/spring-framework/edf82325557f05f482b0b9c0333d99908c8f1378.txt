Avoid implicit autowiring with Kotlin secondary ctors

Autowiring implicitely Kotlin primary constructors
when there are secondary constructors has side effects
on ConstructorResolver. It seems reasonable to
require explicit @Autowired annotation in such case.

With this commit, implicit autowiring of Kotlin
primary constructors is only performed when there
is a primary constructor defined alone or with
a default constructor (define explicitly or
generated via the kotlin-noarg compiler plugin
or via optional constructor parameters with default
values).

Issue: SPR-16022
