Fix context:property-placeholder XSD type hierarchy

context:property-placeholder extends 'propertyPlaceholder' type
defintion once again.  This relationship was inadvertently removed in
3.1 M1, and the effect was that XML tooling would raise errors on
use of attributes like 'location'.

The updated schema has also been published to

    http://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context-3.1.xsd

Issue: SPR-8037
