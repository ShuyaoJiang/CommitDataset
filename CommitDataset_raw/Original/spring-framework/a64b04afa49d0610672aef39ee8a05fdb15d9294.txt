Prefix zip archives with 'spring-framework'

Prior to this change, zip archives were named

   spring-${version}-${classifier}.zip

e.g.:
 - spring-3.2.0.RC1-dist.zip
 - spring-3.2.0.RC1-docs.zip
 - spring-3.2.0.RC1-schema.zip

This commit updates the Gradle build script to ensure that the fully-
qualified 'spring-framework' name is used consistently, such that names
follow the pattern

   spring-framework-${version}-${classifier}.zip

This includes the naming of the root-level directory within the -dist
zip.

Issue: SPR-9954
