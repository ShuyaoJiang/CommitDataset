Proper JCache metadata caching on non cache methods

Prior to this commit, the cache operation metadata cache was not
updated for a method not using the JCache annotations. This means
that every execution of said method was going through the process
of identifying if it was using the cache or not.

This commit adds a default placeholder identifying the absence of
metadata; this allows to flag such method as not having any metadata
at all.

Issue: SPR-12337
