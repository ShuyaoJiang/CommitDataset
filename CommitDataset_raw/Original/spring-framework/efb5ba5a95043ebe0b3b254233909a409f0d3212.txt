Refactor VersionStrategy in WebFlux

Collapse the base interface VersionPathStrategy into its extension
VersionStrategy and then turn the prefix nad fliename based
implementations into abstract base classes (vs delegate strategies).

It is simpler to have one VersionStrategy hierarchy vs that plus a
separate VersionPathStrategy as a delegate. In practice each
VersionStrategy is suited to be prefix or filename based. Also none
of our code cares about the distinction between those two interfaces.
