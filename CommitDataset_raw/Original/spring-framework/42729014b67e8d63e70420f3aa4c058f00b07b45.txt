Move namespace tests to root integration module

Prior to this change, spring-beans contained its own META-INF containing
spring.handlers and spring.schemas files in src/main/resources; it also
had files of the same name within src/test/resources/META-INF, causing
'duplicate resource' warnings and confusion in general.

This commit moves the com.foo test package, it's associated namespace
parsing tests and test versions of META-INF files to the root project
and it's src/test integration testing folder.

Issue: SPR-9431
