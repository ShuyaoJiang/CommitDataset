Upgrade to JUnit 4.10

Spring currently builds against JUnit 4.9; however, in order to ensure
that the Spring TestContext Framework builds and runs against JUnit 4.10
without issues and in order to investigate the possibility of integrating
with newer JUnit features, we are upgrading to JUnit 4.10.

Issue: SPR-9277
