Add --no-daemon to Gradle import

Previously using the Gradle Daemon with import eclipse scripts would cause
issues with the merge plugin. Specifically, projects would randomly not
be associated to the classpath.

This change explicitly adds --no-daemon in the import scripts to ensure
that the problem does not occur.
