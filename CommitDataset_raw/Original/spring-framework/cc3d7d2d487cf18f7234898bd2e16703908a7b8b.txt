Apply dependency management to selected modules

This commit applies the Dependency Management Plugin to modules that
require it; right now Spring Framework is importing BOMs for Netty and
Reactor dependencies only.

Instead of applying those BOMs to all modules, they're applied only
where they're needed.

Issue: SPR-15885
