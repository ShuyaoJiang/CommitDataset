Fix [deprecation] compiler warnings

Fix deprecation compiler warnings by refactoring code or applying
@SuppressWarnings("deprecation") annotations. JUnit tests of
internally deprecated classes are now themselves marked as
@Deprecated.

Numerous EasyMock deprecation warnings will remain until the
migration to mockito can be completed.
