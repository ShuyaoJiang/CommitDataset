Fix handling of required payload.

A payload that is required will now throw an appropriate exception
regardless of if a conversion is required or not.

isEmptyPayload now takes the payload instead of the message
so that both the original payload and the converted payload, if
necessary, share the same logic.

JSR-303 validation is now consistently applied.

Issue: SPR-11577
