Add support for HTTP PATCH method

The HTTP PATCH method is now supported whereever HTTP methods are used.
Annotated controllers can be mapped to RequestMethod.PATCH.

On the client side the RestTemplate execute(..) and exchange(..)
methods can be used with HttpMethod.PATCH. In terms of HTTP client
libraries, Apache HttpComponents HttpClient version 4.2 or later is
required (see HTTPCLIENT-1191). The JDK HttpURLConnection does not
support the HTTP PATCH method.
