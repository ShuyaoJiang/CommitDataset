Introduce general purpose isEmpty() method in ObjectUtils

Prior to this commit, there existed several isEmpty() methods scattered
across various utilities such as ObjectUtils, CollectionUtils, and
StringUtils; however, each of these methods requires a cast to the type
supported for that particular variant.

This commit introduces a general-purpose isEmpty(Object) method in
ObjectUtils that transparently supports multiple object types in a
central location without the need for casts or juggling multiple
utility classes.
