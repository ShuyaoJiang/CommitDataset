Refactor cache support test hierarchy

Refactored getConfig => getApplicationContext such that subclasses have
control over the type of ApplicationContext used by the base class
tests. Done in anticipation of @EnableCaching tests that will favor use
of AnnotationConfigApplicationContext

Also updated all use of ClassPathXmlApplictionContext to
GenericXmlApplicationContext, which is generally preferred.
