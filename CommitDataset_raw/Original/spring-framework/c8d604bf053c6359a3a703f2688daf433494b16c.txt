Ensure @AliasFor overrides attribute in correct meta-annotation

Prior to this commit, an explicit override for an attribute in a
meta-annotation configured via @AliasFor could potentially result in an
incorrect override of an attribute of the same name but in the wrong
meta-annotation.

This commit fixes the algorithm in getAliasedAttributeName(Method,
Class) in AnnotationUtils by ensuring that an explicit attribute
override is only applied to the configured target meta-annotation
(i.e., configured via the 'annotation' attribute in @AliasFor).

Issue: SPR-13325
