Expose ResolvableType in NoSuchBeanDefinitionException

This commit improves NoSuchBeanDefinitionException to expose a full
ResolvableType rather than a raw class if a lookup by type failed. This
allows to know more about the underlying type and is typically useful
when a collection or map is required as the relevant generic type is the
actual bean that wasn't found.
