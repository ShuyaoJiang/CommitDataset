Programmatic ObjectProvider retrieval through BeanFactory API

Introduces getBeanProvider(Class) and getBeanProvider(ResolvableType), also narrowing getBean(String, Class) and isTypeMatch(String, Class) to a non-null Class argument and enriching NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException with a full ResolvableType. In addition, ObjectProvider supports iterable/stream access for collection-style resolution of multiple matching beans now, and collection injection falls back to an empty collection in a single-constructor case with non-null arguments.
