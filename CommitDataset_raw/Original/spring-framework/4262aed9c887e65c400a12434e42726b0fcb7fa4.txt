Refactor BeanFactoryLocator to use getBean(Class)

Prior to this change, (Context)SingletonBeanFactoryLocator used
BeanFactoryUtils#beanOfType(ListableBeanFactory, Class) to locate the
bean of type BeanFactory.

The more modern approach is to use BeanFactory#getBean(Class), which
removes a dependency on ListableBeanFactory interface while at the same
time opening the implementation up to respecting autowiring exclusions,
primary metadata, etc.
