Avoid defining nullability for non-relevant API

Defining nullability of some API like EnvironmentCapable
or ConditionContext causes issues in Spring Boot because
in the context where they are used, it is known for sure
they will return non-null values even if their API can in
other context return null values.

It is better in this case for both Java and Kotlin to
not define at all the nullabity of such API.

In practice, this is achieved by removing the package level
@NonNullApi annotation and adding it only on the
relevant classes.
