Consider security in ClassUtils#getMostSpecificMethod

Recent changes in ExtendedBeanInfo involve invoking
ClassUtils#getMostSpecificMethod when determining JavaBeans get/set
pairs; if Java security settings control disallow reflective access,
this results in an AccessControlException.

This change defends against this (comparatively rare) scenario by
catching the exception and falling back to returning the method
originally supplied by the user.

This change was a result of noticing CallbacksSecurityTests failing
following the ExtendedBeanInfo modifications mentioned above
