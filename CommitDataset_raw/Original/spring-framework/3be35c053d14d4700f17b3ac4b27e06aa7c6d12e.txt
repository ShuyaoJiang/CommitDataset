Use LinkedHashmap to preserve insert order

In several places in the spring-webmvc module, URL patterns / objects
relationships are kept in `HashMap`s. When matching with actual URLs,
the algorithm uses a pattern comparator to sort the matching patterns
and select the most specific. But the underlying collection
implementation does not keep the original order which can lead to
inconsistencies.

This commit changes the underlying collection implementation to
`LinkedHashmap`s, in order to keep the insert order if the comparator
does not reorder entries.

Issue: SPR-13798
