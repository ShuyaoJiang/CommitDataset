Raise RestClientException for unknown status codes

HttpStatus cannot be created with an unknown status code. If a server
returns a status code that's not in the HttpStatus enum values, an
IllegalArgumentException is raised. Rather than allowing it to
propagate as such, this change ensures the actual exception raised is
a RestClientException.
