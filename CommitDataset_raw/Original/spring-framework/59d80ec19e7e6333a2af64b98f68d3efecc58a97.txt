Fix minor issue in MockHttpServletRequest

Previously MockHttpServletRequest#sendRedirect did not set the HTTP status
or the Location header. This does not conform to the HttpServletRequest
interface.

MockHttpServletRequest will now:

  - Set the HTTP status to 302 on sendRedirect
  - Set the Location header on sendRedirect
  - Ensure the Location header and getRedirectedUrl are kept in synch

Issue: SPR-9594
