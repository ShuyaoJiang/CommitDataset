Refactor test HttpServer implementations

Due to the static nature of JUnit parameterized test inputs, an
HttpServer instance is re-used for all tests per test class.

This commit adds lifecycle handling to AbstractHttpServer with a
lifecycle monitor to ensure test server fields are properly
initialized and reset after each test .
