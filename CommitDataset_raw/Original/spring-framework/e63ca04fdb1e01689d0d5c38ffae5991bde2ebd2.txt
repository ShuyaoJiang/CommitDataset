Add Jackson 2 HttpMessageConverter and View

Jackson 2 uses completely new package names and new maven artifact ids.
This change adds Jackson 2 as an optional dependency and also provides
MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter and MappingJackson2JsonView for use
with the new version.

The MVC namespace and the MVC Java config detect and use
MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter if Jackson 2 is present.
Otherwise if Jackson 1.x is present,
then MappingJacksonHttpMessageConverter is used.
