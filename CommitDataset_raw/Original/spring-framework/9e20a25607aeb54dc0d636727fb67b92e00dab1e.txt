Introduce SubProtocolHandler abstraction

Add SubProtocolHandler to encapsulate the logic for using a
sub-protocol.

A SubProtocolWebSocketHandler is also provided to
delegate to the appropriate SubProtocolHandler based on the
negotiated sub-protocol value at handshake.

StompSubProtocolHandler provides handling for STOMP messages.
