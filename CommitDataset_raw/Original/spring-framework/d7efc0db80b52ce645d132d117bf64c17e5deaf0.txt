Detect controller methods via InitializingBean hook

Previously RequestMappingHandlerMapping detected @RequestMapping
methods through an initApplicationContext() hook. However, the
HandlerMapping may not have been fully set up with all its
dependencies at that point including settings like useSuffixPattern
and others.

This change moves the detection @RequestMapping methods to an
InitializingBean.afterPropertiesSet() hook.
