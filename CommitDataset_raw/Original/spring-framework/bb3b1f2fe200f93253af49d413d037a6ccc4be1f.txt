Additional convenience methods in UriUtils

The generic encode method in UriUtils that encodes any character
outside the reserved character set for a URI is meant for "strict"
encoding of URI variable values. This commit adds a couple more
conveninence methods that accept a Map or array of URI variable
values to encode.

This facilitates the use case where the URI template is assumed to
be encoded while URI variables are encoded strictly to avoid any
possibility for unwanted reserved characters:

Map<String, ?> encodedUriVars = UriUtils.encodeUriVariables(uriVars);
uriComponentsBuilder.build(true).expand(encodedUriVars).toUri();
