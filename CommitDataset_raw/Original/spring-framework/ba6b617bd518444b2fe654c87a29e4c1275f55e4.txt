Demo: @Autowired rules not supported with Spring's JUnit rules

This commit introduces a test that demonstrates that custom JUnit 4
rules can be @Autowired into a test instance but that they will not be
applied by JUnit since JUnit only ever sees such fields as null and
therefore ignores them.

Issue: SPR-15927
