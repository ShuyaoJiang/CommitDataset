Add abstractions for content negotiation

Introduced ContentNeogtiationStrategy for resolving the requested
media types from an incoming request. The available implementations
are based on path extension, request parameter, 'Accept' header,
and a fixed default content type. The logic for these implementations
is based on equivalent options, previously available only in the
ContentNegotiatingViewResolver.

Also in this commit is ContentNegotiationManager, the central class to
use when configuring content negotiation options. It accepts one or
more ContentNeogtiationStrategy instances and delegates to them.

The ContentNeogiationManager can now be used to configure the
following classes:

- RequestMappingHandlerMappingm
- RequestMappingHandlerAdapter
- ExceptionHandlerExceptionResolver
- ContentNegotiatingViewResolver
