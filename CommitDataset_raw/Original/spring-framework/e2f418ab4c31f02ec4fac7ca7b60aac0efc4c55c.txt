Added "transactionAware" bean property to EhCacheCacheManager and JCacheCacheManager

In the course of this enhancement, the "cache.ehcache" and "cache.jcache" packages moved from spring-context to the spring-context-support module, expecting further transaction-related functionality. Also aligns with the presence of Spring's Quartz support in the spring-context-support module, since Quartz and EHCache are sort of sister projects at Terracotta now.

Issue: SPR-9966
