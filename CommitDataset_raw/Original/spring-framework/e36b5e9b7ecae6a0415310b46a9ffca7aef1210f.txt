Introduce ContextLoader(Listener) constructors

Constructors have been added to both ContextLoader and
ContextLoaderListener to support instance-based programmatic
registration of listeners within ServletContainerInitializer
implementations in Servlet 3.0+ environments, and more particularly
when using Spring 3.1's WebApplicationInitializer SPI.

Issue: SPR-7672
