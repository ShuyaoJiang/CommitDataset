Improve AntPathMatcher matching performance

This commit speeds up the AntPathMatcher implementation by
pre-processing patterns and checking that candidates are likely
matches if they start with the static prefix of the pattern.

Those changes can result in a small performance penalty for positive
matches, but with a significant boost for checking candidates that don't
match. Overall, this tradeoff is acceptable since this feature is often
used to select a few matching patterns in a much bigger list.

This will lead to small but consistent performance improvements in
Spring MVC when matching a given request with the available routes.
