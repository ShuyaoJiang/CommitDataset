Remove -XX:MaxHeapSize=256m from default GRADLE_OPTS

This setting was causing failures in the CI build, and was not present
prior to the recent updates to gradle wrapper generation.

This commit also simplifies the gradle wrapper customizations by placing
the logic in a doLast block within the original 'wrapper' task, as
to creating a second wrapper task and extending from the first.
