Add SubProtocolCapable interface

The addition of SubProtocolCapable simplifies configuration since it is
no longer necessary to explicitly configure DefaultHandshakeHandler
with a list of supported sub-protocols. We will not also check if the
WebSocketHandler to use for the WebSocket request is an instance of
SubProtocolCapable and obtain the list of sub-protocols that way. The
provided SubProtocolWebSocketHandler does implement this interface.
