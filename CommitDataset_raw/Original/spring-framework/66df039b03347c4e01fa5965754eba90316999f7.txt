SPR-8698 Support flash attrs and a ModelAndView return value.

Before this change, flash attributes could only be added if via
RedirectAttributes.addFlashAttribute(..) if the method returned
a view name or a View instance. With this change, the above is
supported with a ModelAndView return value as well.
