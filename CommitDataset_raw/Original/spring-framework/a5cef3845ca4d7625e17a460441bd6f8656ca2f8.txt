Improve message for HttpStatusCodeException with empty status text

This commit improves the message for HttpStatusCodeException so that it
defaults to the HttpStatus reason phrase if a status text is not
provided.

This commit also fixes SimpleClientHttpResponse so that it does not
return null for getStatusText().

Fixed #22162
