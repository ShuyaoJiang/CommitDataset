Support comments in SQL scripts in JdbcTestUtils

Prior to this commit, utility methods in JdbcTestUtils interpreted SQL
comments as separate statements, resulting in an exception when such a
script is executed.

This commit addresses this issue by introducing a
readScript(lineNumberReader, String) method that accepts a comment
prefix. Comment lines are therefore no longer returned in the parsed
script. Furthermore, the existing readScript(lineNumberReader) method
now delegates to this new readScript() method, supplying "--" as the
default comment prefix.
