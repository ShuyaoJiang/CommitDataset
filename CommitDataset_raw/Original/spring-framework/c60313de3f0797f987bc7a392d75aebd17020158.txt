Refine UriTemplate match pattern

The match/matches methods of UriTemplate use a regex with (.*) in place
of URI variables, which work fine except in the end where such a
pattern can match greedily more than one segment.

This commit updates the regex to use ([^/]*) instead since URI
variables are only meant to be used within a single path segment.

Issue: SPR-16169
