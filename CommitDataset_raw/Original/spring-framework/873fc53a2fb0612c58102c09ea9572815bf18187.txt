Introduce support for JUnit 5 in the TestContext framework

This commit introduces initial support for JUnit Jupiter (i.e., the new
programming and extension models in JUnit 5) in the Spring TestContext
Framework.

Specifically, this commit introduces the following.

- SpringExtension: an implementation of multiple extension APIs from
  JUnit Jupiter that provides full support for the existing feature set
  of the Spring TestContext Framework. This support is enabled via
  @ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class).

- @SpringJUnitConfig: a composed annotation that combines
  @ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class) from JUnit Jupiter with
  @ContextConfiguration from the Spring TestContext Framework.

- @SpringJUnitWebConfig: a composed annotation that combines
  @ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class) from JUnit Jupiter with
  @ContextConfiguration and @WebAppConfiguration from the Spring
  TestContext Framework.

Issue: SPR-13575
