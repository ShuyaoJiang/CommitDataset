Handle null header value property

When using an Apache Http components based infrastructure, a null header
value is handled as the empty string. The exact same infrastructure using
HttpURLConnection generates a header with no colon. This is actually not
proper HTTP and some components fail to read such request.

We now make sure to call HttpURLConnection#addRequestProperty with the
empty String for a null header value.
