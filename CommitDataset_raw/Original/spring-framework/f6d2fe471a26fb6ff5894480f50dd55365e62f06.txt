Proper support for Root WAC in Spring MVC Test

The modifications to DefaultMockMvcBuilder performed in conjunction
with SPR-12553 introduced a breaking change: the WebApplicationContext
supplied to DefaultMockMvcBuilder's constructor was *always* stored in
the ServletContext as the root WebApplicationContext, overwriting a
root WebApplicationContext that had been set by the user or by the
Spring TestContext Framework (TCF) -- for example, in
AbstractGenericWebContextLoader. Consequently, the changes in SPR-12553
cause tests that use @ContextHierarchy to fail if web components rely
on the correct WebApplicationContext being stored under the
WebApplicationContext#ROOT_WEB_APPLICATION_CONTEXT_ATTRIBUTE key.

This commit reverts the breaking changes introduced in SPR-12553: if
the root WebApplicationContext has already been set in the
ServletContext of the WebApplicationContext supplied to
DefaultMockMvcBuilder, no action is taken.

Furthermore, this commit introduces new code to address the initial
intent of SPR-12553. Specifically, if the root WebApplicationContext
has NOT been set in the ServletContext of the WebApplicationContext
supplied to DefaultMockMvcBuilder, the application context hierarchy
will be traversed in search of the root WebApplicationContext, and the
root WebApplicationContext will then be stored under the
ROOT_WEB_APPLICATION_CONTEXT_ATTRIBUTE key.
