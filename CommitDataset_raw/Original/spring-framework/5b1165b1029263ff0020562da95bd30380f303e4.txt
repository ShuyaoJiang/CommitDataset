Ignore path parameters in request mappings

Before this change the presence of path params (e.g. "/foo;q=1/bar")
expected the request mapping to contain a URI variable in the place of
semicolon content (e.g. either "/{foo}/bar" or "/{foo};{fooParams}").

The change ensures path params are ignored in @RequestMapping patterns
so that "/foo/bar" matches to "/foo;q=1/bar" as well as
"/foo;q=1;p=2/bar".

Along with this change, the RequestMappingHandlerMapping no longer
defaults to having semicolon content removed from the URL, which means
@MatrixVariable is supported by default without the need for any
further configuration.
