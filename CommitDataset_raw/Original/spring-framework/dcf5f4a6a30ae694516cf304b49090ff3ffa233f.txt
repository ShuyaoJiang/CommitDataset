javax.annotation.Priority alternative to @Order

This commit rationalizes the use of @Order so that the standard
@Priority annotation can be used instead. The handling of both
annotations are now defined in OrderUtils.

This also updates the link to the JavaEE API so that we refer to
JavaEE7 instead of JavaEE6.
