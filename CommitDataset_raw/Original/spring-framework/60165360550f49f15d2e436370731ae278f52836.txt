Remove ContentTypeResolver from composite converter

Before this change CompositeMessageConverter had a ContentTypeResolver
field that was in turn set on all contained converters.

After this change that field is removed and effectively
CompositeMessageConverter is a simple container of other converters.
Each converter in turn must have been configured with a
ContentTypeResolver.

Doing so means it is less likely to have unexpected consequences when
configuring converters, the ContentTypeResolver set in the composite
converter overriding the one configured in a contained converter.

Also commit 676ce6 added default ContentTypeResolver initialization
to AbstractMessageConverter, which ensures that converters are still
straight forward to configure.
