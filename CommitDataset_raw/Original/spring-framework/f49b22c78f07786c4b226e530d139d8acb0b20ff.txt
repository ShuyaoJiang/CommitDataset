Introduce MockEnvironment in the spring-test module

For legacy reasons, a MockEnvironment implementation already exists in multiple places within Spring's test suite; however, it is not available to the general public.

This commit promotes MockEnvironment to a first-class citizen in the spring-test module, alongside the existing MockPropertySource.

In addition, the following house cleaning has been performed.

 - deleted MockPropertySource from the spring-expression module
 - deleted MockEnvironment from the "spring" integration testing module
 - updated test copies of MockPropertySource and MockEnvironment
 - documented MockEnvironment and MockPropertySource in the testing
   chapter of the reference manual
