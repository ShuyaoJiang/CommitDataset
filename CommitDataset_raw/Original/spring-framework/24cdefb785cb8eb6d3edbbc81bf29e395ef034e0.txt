Workaround for WFLY-3474 NullPointerException

Prior to this commit, the ServletResponseHttpHeaders.get method
would throw an NPE when used under Wildfly 8.0.0.Final and 8.1.0.Final.
This can be traced to WFLY-3474, which throws an NPE when calling
HttpServletResponse.getHeaders("foo") and that header has not
been defined prior to that.
This would cause NPE being thrown by AbstractSockJsService when
checking for CORS HTTP headers in the server HTTP response.

This commit surrounds that method call in AbstractSockJsService and
guards against this issue.

Issue: SPR-11919
