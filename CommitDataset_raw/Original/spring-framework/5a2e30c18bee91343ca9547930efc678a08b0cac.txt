Refactor Resource URL generation and Servlet Filter

Renamed ResourceUrlMapper to ResourceUrlGenerator and refactored it
to be configured with Resource-serving HandlerMappings as opposed to
having them detected in the ApplicationContext through the
BeanPostProcessor contact.

Renamed and polished ResourceUrlEncodingFilter to ResourceUrlFilter
and added tests.
