Provide default ParameterNameDiscoverer for AACBF

Prior to this change, AbstractAutowireCapableBeanFactory did not support
a default ParameterNameDiscoverer.  This meant that attempting to use
<constructor-arg name=".."> syntax would fail (with a fairly obscure
exception) as that feature depends on a ParameterNameDiscoverer to
introspect the constructor arguments.

This lack of a default was originally intended to avoid a dependency on
ASM, but now that (a) .asm is a built-in module and (b) .beans has a
non-optional compile-time dependency on .asm, there is no reason not to
provide this default.

The net effect is that in a number of locations throughout the
framework, namely in GenericApplicationContext and
AbstractRefreshableApplicationContext, it is no longer necessary to
explicitly call AACBF#setParameterNameDiscoverer. This also means that
using a naked BeanFactory (likely for testing scenarios) is that much
easier.
