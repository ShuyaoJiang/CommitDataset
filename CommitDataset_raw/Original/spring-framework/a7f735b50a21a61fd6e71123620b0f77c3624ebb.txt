Make the broker relay heartbeat intervals configurable

Prior to this commit, the intervals at which the broker relay's system
session would send heartbeats to the STOMP broker and expect to
receive heartbeats from the STOMP broker were hard-coded at 10
seconds.

This commit makes the intervals configurable, with 10 seconds being
the default value.
