Refactor @JsonView support w/ ResponseBodyInterceptor

The newly added support for ResponseBodyInterceptor is a good fit for
the (also recently added) support for the Jackson @JsonView annotation.

This change refactors the original implementation of @JsonView support
for @ResponseBody and ResponseEntity controller methods this time
implemented as an ResponseBodyInterceptor.
