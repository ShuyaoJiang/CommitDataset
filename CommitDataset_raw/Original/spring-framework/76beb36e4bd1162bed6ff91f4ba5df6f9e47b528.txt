Remove duplicate separators when combining paths

Prior to this commit, AntPathMatcher would not correctly combine a path
that ends with a separator with a path that starts with a separator.
For example, `/foo/` + `/bar` combined into `/foo//bar`.

Specifically, this commit:

 - Removes the duplicated separator in combined paths

 - Improves RequestMappingInfo's toString() representation

 - Fixes Javadoc formatting in AntPathMatcher

 - Polishes AntPathMatcherTests

 - Polishes Javadoc in AbstractRequestCondition

Issue: SPR-12975
