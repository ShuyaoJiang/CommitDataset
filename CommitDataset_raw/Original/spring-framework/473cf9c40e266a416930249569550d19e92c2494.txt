Preserve ETag HTTP header for versioned resources

Prior to this change, a resource handler chain configured with a
`VersionResourceResolver` would add the resource version to the request
attributes when serving that resource. This approach would not work when
a `CachingResourceResolver` is configured and the resource is already
cached. Indeed, that code path is not executed when the resource is
resolved from the cache.

This commit adds a new `VersionedResource` interface that's used by the
`VersionResourceResolver`, adding a `getVersion()` method that returns
the version string for that resource. This way, the version information
is cached with the resource itself and the request attributes are no
longer used for this.
