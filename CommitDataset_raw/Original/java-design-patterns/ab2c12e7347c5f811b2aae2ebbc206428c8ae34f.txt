1) Refactored LotteryNumbers to use Joiner from guava library to join lottery numbers. 2) Solved potential thread safety issue in LotteryTicketId class, where it was using raw primitive value and incrementing it which is not thread-safe. So used AtomicInteger for brevity 3) assertEquals arguments were in incorrect order at many places, so changed order of those 4) Replaced assertFalse and assertTrue at some places with assertEquals and assertNotEquals for reducing complexity of code 5) Removed public modifiers from test cases, as they are no more needed by JUnit 5
