As getAll method returns a Stream, we cannot close the involved
resources (Connection, Statement and resultSet) until the stream is
closed by the consumer. So try-with-resources is not an option as per
sonarqubeâ€™s recommendation. But it is still recommended to close
statement and result set. When connection pool used, connection is not
closed when close() called. It is just returned to the pool.

Using //NOSONAR to avoid false blocker issue.
