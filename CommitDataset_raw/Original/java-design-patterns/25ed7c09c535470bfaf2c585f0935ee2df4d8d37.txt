Refactored Event Queue (#806)

* 1) Test cases were not stopping AudioService before ending test case 2) Changed Audio to be a good singleton, previously because of Audio being bad singleton, test cases which were using static methods could have caused intermittent failures. 3) Made some other refactorings as well

* Removed sonar issue and converted Audio to eager singleton for simplicity

* Updated class diagram PNG
