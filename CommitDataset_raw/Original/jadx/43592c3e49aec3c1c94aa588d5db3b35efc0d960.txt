gui: improve memory usage (#79)

- don't use suffix tree in search
- decrease default working threads count (only 1 for background jobs)
- use string refs for store only one code string without duplicates
- use cache for creating UI nodes
- allow to disable autostart for background jobs (decompilation and index)
