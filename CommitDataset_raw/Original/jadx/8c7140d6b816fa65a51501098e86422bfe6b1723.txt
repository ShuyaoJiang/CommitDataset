fix: change not allowed access modifiers for methods (#387) (PR #439)

Fix visibility access modifies for methods (see discussions in #370 and #387):
    * all virtual methods become public
    * direct methods become private (instead constructors and static methods for now)
    * such modifications perform by default and can be disabled by the option in preferences (`--respect-bytecode-access-modifiers` in jadx-cli)
    * if changed to method added comment (`Access modifiers changed, original: private`)
