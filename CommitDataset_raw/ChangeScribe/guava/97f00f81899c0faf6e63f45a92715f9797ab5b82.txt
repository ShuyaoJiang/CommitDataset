BUG - FEATURE: <type-ID> 

This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. 
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package com.google.common.collect:  

1.1. Add a class for abstract range set test. It allows to:

	Handle test invariants;
	Handle test invariants internal

1.2. Add an interface declaration  for range map. It allows to:

	Get key;
	Get entry;
	Span range map;
	Put range;
	Coalescing range;
	Put range map;
	Handle clear;
	Remove range;
	Process range map range map as map of ranges;
	Process range map range map as descending map of ranges;
	Handle sub range map;
	Check if range map equals;
	Hash code;
	Convert range map to string

1.3. Add an interface declaration  for range set. It allows to:

	Check if range set contains;
	Get range containing;
	Handle intersects;
	Check if range set encloses;
	Check if range set encloses all;
	Check if range set is empty;
	Span range set;
	Process range set range set as ranges;
	Process range set range set as descending set of ranges;
	Complement range set;
	Handle sub range set;
	Add range;
	Remove range;
	Handle clear;
	Add other range set;
	Add ranges iterable;
	Remove other range set;
	Remove ranges iterable;
	Check if range set equals;
	Hash code;
	Convert range set to string

1.4. Add a class for tree range set test. It allows to:

	Handle test view against expected;
	Handle test ranges by lower bounds;
	Handle test navigation against expected;
	Handle test intersects;
	Handle test enclosing;
	Test all single ranges complement  against remove;
	Handle test invariants empty;
	Handle test empty intersecting;
	Test all single ranges intersecting;
	Test all two ranges intersecting;
	Handle test empty enclosing;
	Test all single ranges enclosing;
	Test all two ranges enclosing;
	Handle test create copy;
	Get expected sub range set;
	Get expected complement;
	Handle test sub range set;
	Handle test complement;
	Handle test sub range set of complement;
	Handle test complement of sub range set;
	Handle test ranges by upper bound;
	Handle test merges connected with overlap;
	Handle test merges connected disjoint;
	Handle test ignores smaller sharing no bound;
	Handle test ignores smaller sharing lower bound;
	Handle test ignores smaller sharing upper bound;
	Handle test ignores equal;
	Handle test extend same lower bound;
	Handle test extend same upper bound;
	Handle test extend both directions;
	Handle test add empty;
	Handle test fill hole exactly;
	Handle test fill hole with overlap;
	Handle test add many pairs;
	Do pair test;
	Handle test remove empty;
	Handle test remove part sharing lower bound;
	Handle test remove part sharing upper bound;
	Handle test remove middle;
	Handle test remove no overlap;
	Handle test remove part from below lower bound;
	Handle test remove part from above upper bound;
	Handle test remove exact;
	Handle test remove all from below lower bound;
	Handle test remove all from above upper bound;
	Handle test remove all extending both directions;
	Handle test range containing 1;
	Convert test range containing;
	Handle test add all;
	Handle test remove all;
	Handle test serialization
