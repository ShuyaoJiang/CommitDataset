BUG - FEATURE: <type-ID> 

This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. This commit  renames some files.
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package com.google.common.graph:  

1.1. Add a class for configurable directed graph test. It allows to:

	Create graph;
	Handle adjacent nodes self loop;
	Handle predecessors self loop;
	Handle successors self loop;
	Handle incident edges self loop;
	Handle degree self loop;
	Process configurable directed graph test configurable directed graph test in degree self loop;
	Out degree self loop;
	Add edge self loop;
	Add edge existing self loop edge  between same nodes;
	Remove node existing node  with self loop edge;
	Remove edge existing self loop edge

1.2. Add a class for configurable simple directed graph test. It allows to:

	Create graph;
	Handle nodes check returned set mutability;
	Handle adjacent nodes check returned set mutability;
	Handle predecessors check returned set mutability;
	Handle successors check returned set mutability;
	Handle incident edges check returned set mutability;
	Add edge self loop;
	Add edge nodes  not in graph

1.3. Add a class for configurable simple undirected graph test. It allows to:

	Create graph;
	Handle nodes check returned set mutability;
	Handle adjacent nodes check returned set mutability;
	Handle predecessors check returned set mutability;
	Handle successors check returned set mutability;
	Handle incident edges check returned set mutability;
	Add edge self loop;
	Add edge nodes  not in graph

1.4. Add a class for configurable undirected graph test. It allows to:

	Create graph;
	Handle adjacent nodes self loop;
	Handle predecessors self loop;
	Handle successors self loop;
	Handle incident edges self loop;
	Handle degree self loop;
	Process configurable undirected graph test configurable undirected graph test in degree self loop;
	Out degree self loop;
	Add edge self loop;
	Add edge existing self loop edge  between same nodes;
	Remove node existing node  with self loop edge;
	Remove edge existing self loop edge

1.5. Add a class for graph builder. It allows to:

	Instantiate graph builder;
	Get directed;
	Handle undirected;
	Process graph builder graph builder from;
	Handle immutable;
	Check if graph builder allows self loops;
	Get expected node count;
	Handle node order;
	Build graph builder;
	Cast graph builder

1.6. Add a class for immutable graph test. It allows to:

	Handle immutable graph;
	Handle copy of immutable graph optimized;
	Handle immutable graph builder applies graph builder config;
	Handle immutable graph builder copies graph builder;
	Handle immutable graph builder add node;
	Handle immutable graph builder put edge from nodes;
	Handle immutable graph builder put edge from endpoint pair
