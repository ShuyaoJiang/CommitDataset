This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. 
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package com.google.common.collect:  

1.1. Add a class for abstract sorted multiset. It allows to:

	Instantiate abstract sorted multiset;
	Instantiate abstract sorted multiset  with comparator;
	Get element set;
	Create element set;
	Get comparator;
	First entry;
	Handle last entry;
	Poll first entry;
	Poll last entry;
	Get sub multiset;
	Descending entry iterator;
	Descending iterator;
	Descending multiset;
	Create descending multiset;
	Forward multiset;
	Get entry iterator;
	Get iterator

1.2. Add a class for descending multiset. It allows to:

	Forward multiset;
	Get comparator;
	Get element set;
	Poll first entry;
	Poll last entry;
	Head multiset;
	Get sub multiset;
	Get tail multiset;
	Delegate descending multiset;
	Descending multiset;
	First entry;
	Handle last entry;
	Get entry iterator;
	Get entry set;
	Create entry set;
	Get multiset;
	Get iterator;
	Get size;
	Convert descending multiset to array;
	Convert descending multiset to string

1.3. Add an interface declaration  for sorted multiset. It allows to:

	Get comparator;
	First entry;
	Handle last entry;
	Poll first entry;
	Poll last entry;
	Get element set;
	Descending multiset;
	Head multiset;
	Get sub multiset;
	Get tail multiset

1.4. Add an interface declaration  for sorted multiset bridge. It allows to:

	Get element set

1.5. Add a class for unmodifiable sorted multiset. It allows to:

	Instantiate unmodifiable sorted multiset  with delegate sorted multiset;
	Delegate unmodifiable sorted multiset;
	Get comparator;
	Create element set;
	Get element set;
	Descending multiset;
	First entry;
	Handle last entry;
	Poll first entry;
	Poll last entry;
	Head multiset;
	Get sub multiset;
	Get tail multiset
