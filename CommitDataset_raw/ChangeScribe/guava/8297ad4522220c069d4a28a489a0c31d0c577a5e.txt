 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package com.google.common.collect:  

1.1. Add a class for comparators test gwt. It allows to:

	Get module name;
	Handle test empties first;
	Handle test empties last;
	Handle test greatest collector;
	Handle test is in order;
	Handle test is in strict order;
	Handle test least collector;
	Handle test lexicographical

1.2. Add a class for streams test gwt. It allows to:

	Get module name;
	Handle test concat double stream;
	Handle test concat int stream;
	Handle test concat long stream;
	Handle test concat ref stream;
	Handle test concat ref stream close is propagated;
	Handle test concat ref stream close is propagated stream concat;
	Handle test concat ref stream close is propagated stream flat map;
	Handle test concat ref stream parallel;
	Handle test for each pair;
	Handle test for each pair differing lengths 1;
	Convert test for each pair differing lengths;
	Handle test for each pair finite with infinite;
	Handle test for each pair one empty;
	Handle test for each pair parallel;
	Handle test map with index array list source;
	Handle test map with index close is propagated sized source;
	Handle test map with index close is propagated unsized source;
	Handle test map with index double stream close is propagated sized;
