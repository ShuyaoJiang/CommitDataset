1.1. Add a class for abstract sorted multiset. It allows to:

	Instantiate abstract sorted multiset;
	Instantiate abstract sorted multiset  with comparator;
	Get element set;
	Create element set;
	Get comparator;
	First entry;
	Handle last entry;
	Poll first entry;
	Poll last entry;
	Get sub multiset;
	Descending entry iterator;
	Descending iterator;
	Descending multiset;
	Create descending multiset

1.2. Add a class for descending immutable sorted multiset. It allows to:

	Instantiate descending immutable sorted multiset  with forward immutable sorted multiset;
	Get count;
	First entry;
	Handle last entry;
	Get size;
	Get element set;
	Get entry;
	Descending multiset;
	Head multiset;
	Get tail multiset;
	Check if descending immutable sorted multiset is partial view

1.3. Add a class for immutable sorted multiset fauxveride shim. It allows to:

	Convert immutable sorted multiset fauxveride shim to immutable multiset;
	Get builder;
	O element;
	O e 1;
	Get copy of

	Process regular immutable sorted multiset regular immutable sorted multiset for each entry;
	First entry;
	Handle last entry;
	Get size;
	Get element set;
	Head multiset;
	Get tail multiset;
	Get sub multiset;
	Check if regular immutable sorted multiset is partial view
