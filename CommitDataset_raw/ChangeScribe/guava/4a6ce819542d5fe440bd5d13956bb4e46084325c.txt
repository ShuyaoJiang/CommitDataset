This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. 
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package com.google.common.graph:  

1.1. Add a class for forwarding network. It allows to:

	Delegate forwarding network;
	Get nodes;
	Get edges;
	Check if forwarding network is directed;
	Check if forwarding network allows parallel edges;
	Check if forwarding network allows self loops;
	Handle node order;
	Get edge order;
	Handle adjacent nodes;
	Get predecessors;
	Get successors;
	Get incident edges;
	Process forwarding network forwarding network in edges;
	Out edges;
	Get incident nodes;
	Handle adjacent edges;
	Get degree;
	Process forwarding network forwarding network in degree;
	Out degree;
	Get edges connecting;
	Edge connecting or null;
	Check if forwarding network has edge connecting;

1.2. Add a class for forwarding value graph. It allows to:

	Delegate forwarding value graph;
	Get nodes;
	Edge count;
	Check if forwarding value graph is directed;
	Check if forwarding value graph allows self loops;
	Handle node order;
	Handle adjacent nodes;
	Get predecessors;
	Get successors;
	Get degree;
	Process forwarding value graph forwarding value graph in degree;
	Out degree;
	Check if forwarding value graph has edge connecting;
	Get edge value or default;
