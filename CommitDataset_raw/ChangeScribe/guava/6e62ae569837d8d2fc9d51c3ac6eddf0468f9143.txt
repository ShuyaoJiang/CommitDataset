BUG - FEATURE: <type-ID> 

This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. This commit  renames some files.
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package com.google.common.graph:  

1.1. Add a class for abstract value graph. It allows to:

	Process abstract value graph abstract value graph as graph;
	Get nodes;
	Get edges;
	Check if  is directed;
	Check if  allows self loops;
	Handle node order;
	Handle adjacent nodes;
	Get predecessors;
	Get successors;
	Get degree;
	Process  in degree;
	Out degree;
	Get edge value;
	Check if abstract value graph equals;
	Hash code;
	Convert abstract value graph to string;
	Get edge value map;
	Apply edge endpoint pair

1.2. Rename type AbstractConfigurableNetwork with ConfigurableNetwork

1.3. Add a class for configurable value graph. It allows to:

	Instantiate configurable value graph  with abstract graph builder;
	Instantiate configurable value graph  with abstract graph builder, node connections map and node connections map;
	Get nodes;
	Check if configurable value graph is directed;
	Check if configurable value graph allows self loops;
	Handle node order;
	Handle adjacent nodes;
	Get predecessors;
	Get successors;
	Check if configurable value graph has edge connecting;
	Get edge value or default;
	Edge count;
	Get checked connections;
	Check if configurable value graph contains node;
	Check if configurable value graph has edge connecting internal;
	Get edge value or default internal

1.4. Add a class for forwarding graph. It allows to:

	Delegate forwarding graph;
	Get nodes;
	Edge count;
	Check if forwarding graph is directed;
	Check if forwarding graph allows self loops;
	Handle node order;
	Handle adjacent nodes;
	Get predecessors;
	Get successors;
	Get degree;
	Process forwarding graph forwarding graph in degree;
	Out degree;
	Check if forwarding graph has edge connecting;
