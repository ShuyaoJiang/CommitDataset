 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package com.google.common.util.concurrent:  

1.1. Add a class for future callback test gwt. It allows to:

	Get module name;
	Handle test cancel;

	Handle test runtime exeception from get;
	Handle test same thread execution exception;
	Handle test same thread success;
	Handle test throw error from get;
	Handle test wildcard future
