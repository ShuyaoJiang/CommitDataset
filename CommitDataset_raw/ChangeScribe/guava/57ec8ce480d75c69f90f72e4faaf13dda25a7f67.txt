BUG - FEATURE: <type-ID> 

This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. 
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package com.google.common.graph:  

1.1. Add a class for abstract graph builder. It allows to:

	Instantiate abstract graph builder

1.2. Add a class for configurable mutable value graph. It allows to:

	Instantiate configurable mutable value graph  with abstract graph builder;
	Add node;
	Add node internal;
	Put edge value;
	Remove node;
	Remove edge;
	Handle new connections

1.3. Add a class for value graph builder. It allows to:

	Instantiate value graph builder;
	Get directed;
	Handle undirected;
	Process value graph builder value graph builder from;
	Handle immutable;
	Check if value graph builder allows self loops;
	Get expected node count;
	Handle node order;
	Build value graph builder;
	Cast value graph builder

1.4. Add a class for value graph test. It allows to:

	Validate graph state;
	Get directed graph;
	Handle undirected graph;
	Check if value graph test has edge connecting directed correct;
	Check if value graph test has edge connecting directed backwards;
	Check if value graph test has edge connecting directed mismatch;
	Check if value graph test has edge connecting undirected correct;
	Check if value graph test has edge connecting undirected backwards;
	Check if value graph test has edge connecting undirected mismatch;
	Handle edge value directed correct;
	Handle edge value directed backwards;
	Handle edge value directed mismatch;
	Handle edge value undirected correct;
	Handle edge value undirected backwards;
	Handle edge value undirected mismatch;
	Handle edge value or default directed correct;
	Handle edge value or default directed backwards;
	Handle edge value or default directed mismatch;
	Handle edge value or default undirected correct;
	Handle edge value or default undirected backwards;
	Handle edge value or default undirected mismatch;
	Put edge value directed;
	Put edge value directed order mismatch;
	Put edge value undirected order mismatch;
	Put edge value undirected;
	Remove edge directed;
	Remove edge undirected;
	Remove edge directed order mismatch;
	Remove edge undirected order mismatch;
	Handle edge value missing;
	Handle equivalence considers edge value
