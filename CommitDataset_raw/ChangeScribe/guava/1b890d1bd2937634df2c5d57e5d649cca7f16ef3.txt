	Handle mark;
	Reset hashing input stream;
	Hash hashing input stream

1.2. Add a class for hashing input stream test. It allows to:

	Set hashing input stream test;
	Handle test read put single byte;
	Handle test read put byte array;
	Handle test read put byte array at pos;
	Handle test read put byte array out of bound;
	Handle test hash hashes correctly;
	Handle test hash hashes correctly read out of bound;
	Handle test hash hashes correctly for skipping;
	Handle test checks for null

1.3. Add a class for hashing output stream. It allows to:
