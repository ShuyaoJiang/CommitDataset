	Check if forwarding immutable map is partial view;
	Check if forwarding immutable map is empty;
	Check if forwarding immutable map contains key;
	Check if forwarding immutable map contains value;
	Get forwarding immutable map;
	Create entry set;
	Delegate;
	Check if  contains;
	Convert to array;
	Create key set;
	Create values;
	Get size;
	Check if forwarding immutable map equals;
	Hash code;
	Convert forwarding immutable map to string

1.2. Add a class for forwarding immutable set. It allows to:

	Instantiate forwarding immutable set  with delegate set;
	Get iterator;
	Check if forwarding immutable set contains;
	Check if forwarding immutable set contains all;
	Get size;
	Check if forwarding immutable set is empty;
