This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. 
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package com.google.common.primitives:  

1.1. Add a class for unsigned ints. It allows to:

	Instantiate unsigned ints;
	Flip unsigned ints;
	Compare unsigned ints;
	Convert unsigned ints to long;
	Get checked cast;
	Get saturated cast;
	Get min;
	Get max;
	Join unsigned ints;
	Handle lexicographical comparator;
	Convert unsigned ints to string;
	Handle sort;
	Descending unsigned ints;
	Divide unsigned ints;
	Get remainder;
	Decode unsigned ints;
	Parse unsigned int;

1.2. Add a class for unsigned ints test. It allows to:

	Handle test checked cast;
	Assert cast fails;
	Handle test saturated cast;
	Convert test;
	Handle test compare;
	Handle test max no args;
	Handle test max;
	Handle test min no args;
	Handle test min;
	Handle test lexicographical comparator;
	Handle test sort;
	Handle test sort indexed;
	Handle test sort descending;
	Handle test sort descending indexed;
	Handle test divide;
	Handle test remainder;
	Handle test divide remainder euclidean property;
	Handle test parse int;
	Handle test parse int fail;
	Handle test parse int with radix;
	Handle test parse int with radix limits;
	Handle test parse int throws exception for invalid radix;
	Handle test decode int;
	Handle test decode int fails;
	Handle test join;
	Join unsigned ints test;
	Handle test nulls
