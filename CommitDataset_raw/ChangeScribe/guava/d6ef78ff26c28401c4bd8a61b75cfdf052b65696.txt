BUG - FEATURE: <type-ID> 

This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. This commit  renames some files.
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package com.google.common.graph:  

1.1. Rename type AbstractDirectedNodeConnections with AbstractDirectedNetworkConnections

1.2. Rename type AbstractUndirectedNodeConnections with AbstractUndirectedNetworkConnections

1.3. Add a class for directed multi network connections. It allows to:

	Instantiate directed multi network connections  with in edges map, out edges map and out edges map;
	O directed multi network connections;
	Process directed multi network connections directed multi network connections of immutable;
	Get predecessors;
	Get predecessors multiset;
	Get successors;
	Get successors multiset;
	Get edges connecting;
	Get size;
	Remove edge in edge;
	Remove out edge;
	Add edge in edge;
	Add out edge;
	Get reference

1.4. Add a class for directed network connections. It allows to:

	Instantiate directed network connections  with in edge map, out edge map and out edge map;
	O directed network connections;
	Process directed network connections directed network connections of immutable;
	Get predecessors;
	Get successors;
	Get edges connecting

1.5. Add an interface declaration  for graph connections. It allows to:

	Handle adjacent nodes;
	Get predecessors;
	Get successors;
	Get value;
	Remove predecessor;
	Remove successor;
	Add predecessor;
	Add successor

1.6. Add an interface declaration  for network connections. It allows to:

	Handle adjacent nodes;
	Get predecessors;
	Get successors;
	Get incident edges;
	Process network connections network connections in edges;
	Out edges;
	Get edges connecting;
	Handle adjacent node;
	Remove edge in edge;
	Remove out edge;
	Add edge in edge;
	Add out edge

1.7. Add a class for undirected graph connections. It allows to:

	Instantiate undirected graph connections  with adjacent node values map;
	O undirected graph connections;
	Process undirected graph connections undirected graph connections of immutable;
	Handle adjacent nodes;
	Get predecessors;
	Get successors;
	Get value;
	Remove predecessor;
	Remove successor;
	Add predecessor;
	Add successor

1.8. Add a class for undirected multi network connections. It allows to:

	Instantiate undirected multi network connections  with incident edges map;
	O undirected multi network connections;
	Process undirected multi network connections undirected multi network connections of immutable;
	Handle adjacent nodes;
	Handle adjacent nodes multiset;
	Get edges connecting;
	Get size;
	Remove edge in edge;
	Remove out edge;
	Add edge in edge;
	Add out edge;
	Get reference

1.9. Add an object creator class for undirected network connections. It allows to:

	Instantiate undirected network connections  with incident edge map;
	O undirected network connections;
	Process undirected network connections undirected network connections of immutable;
	Handle adjacent nodes;
	Get edges connecting
