 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package com.google.common.util.concurrent:  

1.1. Add a class for test platform. It allows to:

	Verify get  on pending future;
	Verify timed get  on pending future;
	Verify thread was  not interrupted;
	Handle clear interrupt;
	Get done  from timeout overload;
	Instantiate test platform

1.2. Add a class for trusted input future test. It allows to:

	Handle new delegate

1.3. Add a class for trusted input future test gwt. It allows to:

	Get module name;
	Handle test canceled;
	Handle test failed;
	Handle test interrupted;
	Handle test listen later canceled;
	Handle test listen later failed;
	Handle test listen later interrupted;
	Handle test listen later set asynchronously;
	Handle test listen later set asynchronously later delegate canceled;
	Handle test listen later set asynchronously later delegate failed;
	Handle test listen later set asynchronously later delegate interrupted;
	Handle test listen later set asynchronously later delegate successful;
	Handle test listen later set asynchronously later self canceled;
	Handle test listen later set asynchronously later self interrupted;
	Handle test listen later successful;
	Handle test misbehaving listener already done;
	Handle test misbehaving listener later done;
	Handle test negative timeout;
	Handle test null executor;
	Handle test null listener;
	Handle test null time unit;
	Handle test pending;
	Handle test set exception null;
	Handle test set future delegate already canceled;
	Handle test set future delegate already interrupted;
	Handle test set future delegate already successful;
	Handle test set future delegate later canceled;
	Handle test set future delegate later interrupted;
	Handle test set future delegate later successful;
	Handle test set future null;
	Handle test set future pending;
	Handle test set future then cancel;
	Handle test set future then interrupt;
	Handle test set null;
	Handle test successful

1.4. Add a class for untrusted input future test. It allows to:

	Handle new delegate

1.5. Add a class for untrusted input future test gwt. It allows to:

	Get module name;
	Handle test canceled;
	Handle test failed;
	Handle test interrupted;
	Handle test listen later canceled;
	Handle test listen later failed;
	Handle test listen later interrupted;
	Handle test listen later set asynchronously;
	Handle test listen later set asynchronously later delegate canceled;
	Handle test listen later set asynchronously later delegate failed;
	Handle test listen later set asynchronously later delegate interrupted;
	Handle test listen later set asynchronously later delegate successful;
	Handle test listen later set asynchronously later self canceled;
	Handle test listen later set asynchronously later self interrupted;
	Handle test listen later successful;
	Handle test misbehaving listener already done;
	Handle test misbehaving listener later done;
	Handle test negative timeout;
	Handle test null executor;
	Handle test null listener;
	Handle test null time unit;
	Handle test pending;
	Handle test set exception null;
	Handle test set future delegate already canceled;
	Handle test set future delegate already interrupted;
	Handle test set future delegate already successful;
	Handle test set future delegate later canceled;
	Handle test set future delegate later interrupted;
	Handle test set future delegate later successful;
	Handle test set future null;
