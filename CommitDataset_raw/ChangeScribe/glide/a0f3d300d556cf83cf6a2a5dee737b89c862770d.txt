BUG - FEATURE: <type-ID> 

This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. 
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package com.bumptech.glide.load.data:  

1.1. Add a class for buffered output stream. It allows to:

	Instantiate buffered output stream  with output stream, array pool and array pool;
	Write buffered output stream;
	Handle flush;
	Handle flush buffer;
	Maybe flush buffer;
	Close buffered output stream;
	Handle release

1.2. Add a class for buffered output stream test. It allows to:
