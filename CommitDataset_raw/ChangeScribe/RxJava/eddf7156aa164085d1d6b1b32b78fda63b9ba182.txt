This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. 
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package io.reactivex.schedulers:  

1.1. Add a class for abstract scheduler concurrency tests. It allows to:

	Handle test un subscribe for scheduler;
	Apply;
	Process  on complete;
	Process  on error;
	Process  on next;
	Handle test unsubscribe recursive schedule from outside;
	Run;
	Handle test unsubscribe recursive schedule from inside;
	Handle test unsubscribe recursive schedule with delay;
	Handle recursion from outer action and unsubscribe inside;
	Handle test recursion;
	Handle test recursion and outer unsubscribe;
	Subscribe subscriber;
	Cancel;
	Handle request;
	Handle test subscribe with scheduler;
	Accept integer;

1.2. Add a class for cached thread scheduler test. It allows to:

	Get scheduler;
	Handle test IO scheduler;
	Apply integer;
	Accept;
	Convert test unhandled error is delivered;
	Convert test handled error is not delivered;
	Handle test canceled task retention;
	Handle worker disposed;
	Handle shutdown rejects;
	Run

1.3. Add a class for computation scheduler tests. It allows to:

	Get scheduler;
	Handle test thread safety when scheduler is hopping between threads;
	Run;
	Handle test computation thread pool 1;
	Apply integer;
	Accept;
	Handle test merge with executor scheduler;
	Convert test unhandled error is delivered;
	Convert test handled error is not delivered;
	Handle test canceled task retention;
	Handle shutdown rejects;

1.4. Add a class for new thread scheduler test. It allows to:

	Get scheduler;
	Convert test unhandled error is delivered;
	Convert test handled error is not delivered;
	Handle shutdown rejects;
	Run;
	Handle npe regression;

1.5. Add a class for scheduler lifecycle test. It allows to:

	Handle test shutdown;
	Try out schedulers;
	Run;
	Handle test start idempotence

1.6. Add a class for test scheduler test. It allows to:

	Handle test periodic scheduling;
	Run;
	Handle test periodic scheduling unsubscription;
	Handle test immediate unsubscribes;
	Convert test immediate unsubscribes;
	Handle test nested schedule;
	Subscribe a subscriber;
	Get timed runnable to string;
	Convert to string;
	Handle worker disposed;
	Handle constructor time sets time

1.7. Add a class for trampoline scheduler test. It allows to:

	Get scheduler;
	Handle test merge with current thread scheduler 1;
	Apply integer;
	Accept;
	Handle test nested trampoline with unsubscribe;
	Run;
	Handle test trampoline worker handles concurrent scheduling;
	Apply count integer;
	Apply;
	Do work  on new trampoline;
	Create print action;
