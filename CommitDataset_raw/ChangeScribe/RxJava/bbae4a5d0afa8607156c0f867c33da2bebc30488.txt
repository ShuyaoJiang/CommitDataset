1. Changes to package io.reactivex:  

1. Changes to package io.reactivex.internal.operators.maybe:  

1.1. Add a class for maybe do after success test. It allows to:

	Accept integer;
	Process  on next;
	Just maybe do after success test;
	Handle error;
	Handle empty;
	Handle consumer null;
	Just conditional;
	Handle error conditional;
	Handle empty conditional;
	Handle consumer throws;
	Dispose maybe do after success test;
	Double maybe do after success test on subscribe;
	Apply maybe

2. Changes to package io.reactivex.internal.operators.observable:  

2.1. Add a class for observable do after next test. It allows to:

	Accept integer;
	Process  on next;
	Just observable do after next test;
	Handle just hidden;
	Handle range;
	Handle error;
	Handle empty;
	Handle sync fused;
	Handle async fused rejected;
	Handle async fused;
	Handle consumer null;
	Just conditional;
	Handle range conditional;
	Handle error conditional;
	Handle empty conditional;
	Handle sync fused conditional;
	Handle async fused rejected conditional;
	Handle async fused conditional;
	Handle consumer throws;
	Handle consumer throws conditional;
	Convert consumer throws conditional;

3. Changes to package io.reactivex.internal.operators.single:  

3.1. Add a class for single do after success test. It allows to:

	Accept integer;
	Process  on next;
	Just single do after success test;
	Handle error;
	Handle consumer null;
	Just conditional;
	Handle error conditional;
	Handle consumer throws;
