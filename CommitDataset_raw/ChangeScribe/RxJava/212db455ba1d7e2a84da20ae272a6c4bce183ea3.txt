1. Changes to package io.reactivex:  

1. Changes to package io.reactivex.internal.observers:  

1.1. Add a class for basic fuseable observer test. It allows to:

	Offer basic fuseable observer test;
	Get poll;
	Get request fusion;
	Process  on next;
	Process  before downstream;

2. Changes to package io.reactivex.internal.operators.observable:  

2.1. Add a class for observable concat map test. It allows to:

	Handle async fused;
	Apply v integer;

	Handle main error;
	Handle inner error;
	Handle main error delayed;
	Handle inner error delay error;
	Handle inner error delay error 2;
	Call;
	Handle bad source;
	Subscribe actual;
	Handle bad source delay error;
	Handle normal delay errors;
	Handle normal delay errors till the end;
	Process observable concat map test observable concat map test on error race;
	Run;
	Handle mapper throws;
	Get fused poll throws;
	Get fused poll throws delay error;
	Handle mapper throws delay error;
	Handle bad inner delay error;
	Concat reports disposed on complete;
	Process  on subscribe;
	Process  on next;
	Process  on error;
	Process  on complete;
