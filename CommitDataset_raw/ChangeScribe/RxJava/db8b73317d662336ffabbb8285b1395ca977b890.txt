1. Changes to package io.reactivex:  

1. Changes to package io.reactivex.internal.operators.maybe:  

1.1. Add a class for maybe cache test. It allows to:

	Handle offline success;
	Handle offline error;
	Handle offline complete;
	Handle online success;
	Handle online error;
	Handle online complete;
	Cross cancel  on success;
	Accept v integer;
	Cross cancel  on error;
	Accept;
	Cross cancel  on complete;
	Run;
	Add add race;
	Remove remove race;
	Dispose dispose;
	Process  on subscribe;
	Process  on success;
	Process  on error;
	Process  on complete

1.2. Add a class for maybe contains test. It allows to:

	Check if maybe contains test does contain;
	Handle doesnt contain;
	Handle empty;
	Handle error;
	Dispose maybe contains test;
	Check if maybe contains test is disposed;
	Double maybe contains test on subscribe;
	Apply f maybe;
	Check if maybe contains test has source

1.3. Add a class for maybe count test. It allows to:

	One maybe count test;
	Handle empty;
	Handle error;
	Dispose maybe count test;
	Check if maybe count test is disposed;
	Double maybe count test on subscribe;
	Apply f maybe;
	Check if maybe count test has source

1.4. Add a class for maybe delay test. It allows to:

	Handle success;
	Handle error;
	Complete maybe delay test;
	Handle null unit;
	Handle null scheduler;
	Dispose maybe delay test during delay;
	Dispose maybe delay test;
	Check if maybe delay test is disposed;
	Double maybe delay test on subscribe;
	Apply f maybe

1.5. Add a class for maybe switch if empty test. It allows to:

	Non empty;
	Handle empty;
	Handle default if empty non empty;
	Handle default if empty empty;
	Handle error;
	Handle error other;
	Handle empty other too;
	Dispose maybe switch if empty test;
	Check if maybe switch if empty test is disposed;
	Double maybe switch if empty test on subscribe;
	Apply f maybe;
	Handle empty cancel race;
	Run;
