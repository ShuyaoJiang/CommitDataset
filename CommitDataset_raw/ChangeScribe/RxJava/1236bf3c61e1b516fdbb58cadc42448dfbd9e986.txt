 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package io.reactivex:  

1. Changes to package io.reactivex.internal.operators.maybe:  

1.1. Add a class for maybe take until test. It allows to:

	Handle normal publisher;
	Handle normal maybe;
	Process maybe take until test maybe take until test until first publisher;
	Process maybe take until test maybe take until test until first maybe;
	Handle disposed;
	Double maybe take until test on subscribe;
	Apply maybe;
	Handle main errors;
	Handle other errors;
	Handle main completes;
	Handle other completes;
	Process maybe take until test maybe take until test on error race;
	Run;
	Process maybe take until test maybe take until test on complete race;
	Process maybe take until test maybe take until test until maybe main success;
	Process maybe take until test maybe take until test until maybe main complete;
	Process maybe take until test maybe take until test until maybe main error;
	Process maybe take until test maybe take until test until maybe other success;
	Process maybe take until test maybe take until test until maybe other complete;
	Process maybe take until test maybe take until test until maybe other error;
	Process maybe take until test maybe take until test until maybe dispose;
	Process maybe take until test maybe take until test until publisher main success;
	Process maybe take until test maybe take until test until publisher main complete;
	Process maybe take until test maybe take until test until publisher main error;
	Process maybe take until test maybe take until test until publisher other on next;
	Process maybe take until test maybe take until test until publisher other on complete;
	Process maybe take until test maybe take until test until publisher other error;
	Process maybe take until test maybe take until test until publisher dispose
