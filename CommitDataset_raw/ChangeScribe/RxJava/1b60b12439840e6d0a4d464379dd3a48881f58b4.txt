BUG - FEATURE: <type-ID> 

This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. 
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package io.reactivex.parallel:  

1.1. Add a class for parallel do on next try test. It allows to:

	Accept parallel do on next try test;
	Do parallel do on next try test on next no error;
	Do parallel do on next try test on next error no error;
	Do parallel do on next try test on next conditional no error;
	Do parallel do on next try test on next error conditional no error;
	Do parallel do on next try test on next fail with error;
	Accept v integer;
	Do parallel do on next try test on next fail with stop;
	Do parallel do on next try test on next fail with retry;
	Do parallel do on next try test on next fail with retry limited;
	Apply throwable;
	Do parallel do on next try test on next fail with skip;
	Do parallel do on next try test on next fail handler throws;
	Do parallel do on next try test on next wrong parallelism;
	Handle filter invalid source;
	Do parallel do on next try test on next fail with error conditional;
	Do parallel do on next try test on next fail with stop conditional;
	Do parallel do on next try test on next fail with retry conditional;
	Do parallel do on next try test on next fail with retry limited conditional;
	Do parallel do on next try test on next fail with skip conditional;
	Do parallel do on next try test on next fail handler throws conditional;
	Do parallel do on next try test on next wrong parallelism conditional;
	Handle filter invalid source conditional

1.2. Add a class for parallel filter try test. It allows to:

	Accept parallel filter try test;
	Handle filter no error;
	Handle filter false;
	Handle filter false conditional;
	Handle filter error no error;
	Handle filter conditional no error;
	Handle filter error conditional no error;
	Handle filter fail with error;
	Handle test;
	Handle filter fail with stop;
	Handle filter fail with retry;
	Handle filter fail with retry limited;
	Apply throwable;
	Handle filter fail with skip;
	Handle filter fail handler throws;
	Handle filter wrong parallelism;
	Handle filter invalid source;
	Handle filter fail with error conditional;
	Handle filter fail with stop conditional;
	Handle filter fail with retry conditional;
	Handle filter fail with retry limited conditional;
	Handle filter fail with skip conditional;
	Handle filter fail handler throws conditional;
	Handle filter wrong parallelism conditional;
	Handle filter invalid source conditional

1.3. Add a class for parallel map try test. It allows to:

	Accept parallel map try test;
	Map no error;
	Map error no error;
	Map conditional no error;
	Map error conditional no error;
	Map fail  with error;
	Apply v integer;
	Map fail  with stop;
	Map fail  with retry;
	Map fail  with retry limited;
	Apply throwable;
	Map fail  with skip;
	Map fail handler throws;
	Map wrong parallelism;
	Map invalid source;
	Map fail  with error conditional;
	Map fail  with stop conditional;
	Map fail  with retry conditional;
	Map fail  with retry limited conditional;
	Map fail  with skip conditional;
	Map fail handler throws conditional;
	Map wrong parallelism conditional;
	Map invalid source conditional;
	Handle failure handling enum
