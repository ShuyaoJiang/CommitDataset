This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. 
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package io.reactivex.exceptions:  

1.1. Add a class for on error not implemented exception. It allows to:

	Instantiate on error not implemented exception  with throwable;

2. Changes to package io.reactivex.subscribers:  

2.1. Add a class for test subscriber test. It allows to:

	Handle test assert;
	Handle test assert not match count;
	Handle test assert not match value;
	Assert test subscriber test never at not matching value;
	Assert test subscriber test never at matching value;
	Assert test subscriber test never at matching predicate;
