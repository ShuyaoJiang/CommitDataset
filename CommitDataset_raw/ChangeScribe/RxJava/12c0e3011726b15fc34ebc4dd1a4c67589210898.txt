1. Changes to package io.reactivex.flowable:  

1. Changes to package io.reactivex.internal.operators.flowable:  

1.1. Add a class for flowable concat with completable test. It allows to:

	Handle normal;
	Run;
	Handle main error;
	Handle other error;
	Take main;
	Cancel other;
	Handle bad source;
	Subscribe actual

1.2. Add a class for flowable concat with maybe test. It allows to:

	Handle normal empty;
	Run;
	Handle normal non empty;
	Handle backpressure;
	Handle main error;
	Handle other error;
	Take main;
	Cancel other

1.3. Add a class for flowable concat with single test. It allows to:

	Handle normal;
	Handle backpressure;
	Handle main error;
	Handle other error;
	Take main;
	Cancel other

2. Changes to package io.reactivex.internal.operators.observable:  

2.1. Add a class for observable concat with completable test. It allows to:

	Handle normal;
	Run;
	Handle main error;
	Handle other error;
	Take main;
	Cancel other;
	Handle bad source;
	Subscribe actual;
	Handle consumer disposed;

2.2. Add a class for observable concat with maybe test. It allows to:
