BUG - FEATURE: <type-ID> 

This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. 
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package io.reactivex:  

1. Changes to package io.reactivex.internal.operators.mixed:  

1.1. Add a class for flowable switch map maybe test. It allows to:

	Handle simple;
	Apply v integer;
	Handle simple empty;
	Handle simple mixed;
	Handle backpressured;
	Handle main error;
	Handle inner error;
	Double flowable switch map maybe test on subscribe;
	Apply flowable;
	Handle limit;
	Switch flowable switch map maybe test over;
	Switch flowable switch map maybe test over delay error;
	Handle main error inner complete delay error;
	Handle main error inner success delay error;
	Handle mapper crash;
	Dispose flowable switch map maybe test before switch in on next;
	Dispose flowable switch map maybe test on next after first;
	Cancel flowable switch map maybe test;
	Handle main error after termination;
	Subscribe actual;
	Handle inner error after termination;
	Handle next cancel race;
	Run;
	Handle next inner error race;
	Handle main error inner error race;
	Handle test;
	Handle next inner success race;
	Request flowable switch map maybe test more on next;
	Process  on next

1.2. Add a class for flowable switch map single test. It allows to:

	Handle simple;
	Apply v integer;
	Handle main error;
	Handle inner error;
	Double flowable switch map single test on subscribe;
	Apply flowable;
	Handle limit;
	Switch flowable switch map single test over;
	Switch flowable switch map single test over delay error;
	Handle main error inner complete delay error;
	Handle main error inner success delay error;
	Handle mapper crash;
	Dispose flowable switch map single test before switch in on next;
	Dispose flowable switch map single test on next after first;
	Cancel flowable switch map single test;
	Handle main error after termination;
	Subscribe actual;
	Handle inner error after termination;
	Handle next cancel race;
	Run;
	Handle next inner error race;
	Handle main error inner error race;
	Handle test;
	Handle next inner success race;
	Request flowable switch map single test more on next;
	Process  on next;
	Handle backpressured
