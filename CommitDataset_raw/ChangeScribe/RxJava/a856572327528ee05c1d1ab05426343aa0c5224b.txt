This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. This commit  renames some files.
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package io.reactivex:  

1. Changes to package io.reactivex.internal.operators.flowable:  

1. Changes to package io.reactivex.internal.operators.single:  

1. Changes to package io.reactivex.internal.subscriptions:  

1. Changes to package io.reactivex.processors:  

1.1. Add a class for unicast processor test. It allows to:

	Create unicast processor test;
	Handle fusion live;
	Handle fusion offlie;
	Fail unicast processor test fast;
	Fail fast fusion offline;
	Three args factory;
	Run;
	Process unicast processor test unicast processor test on terminate called when on error;
	Process unicast processor test unicast processor test on terminate called when on complete;
	Handle on terminate called when canceled;
	Null unicast processor test on terminate;
	Handle negative capacity hint;
	Zero capacity hint;
	Complete cancel race;
	Handle after done;
	Process unicast processor test unicast processor test on error state peeking;
	Reject sync fusion;
	Cancel unicast processor test on arrival;
	Handle multi subscriber;
	Handle fused drain cancel;
	Subscribe race;
	Check if unicast processor test has observers;
	Drain fused fail  fast;
	Drain fused fail  fast empty;
	Check terminated fail  fast empty;
	Handle already canceled;
	Handle unicast subscription bad request

2. Changes to package io.reactivex.single:  

2. Changes to package io.reactivex.subjects:  

2.1. Add a class for unicast subject test. It allows to:

	Create unicast subject test;
	Handle fusion live;
	Handle fusion offlie;
	Fail unicast subject test fast;
	Three args factory fail  fast;
	Three args factory delay error;
	Handle fusion offline fail fast;
	Handle fusion offline fail fast multiple events;
	Fail unicast subject test fast multiple events;
	Process unicast subject test unicast subject test on terminate called when on error;
	Run;
	Process unicast subject test unicast subject test on terminate called when on complete;
	Handle on terminate called when canceled;
	Null unicast subject test on terminate;
	Handle negative capacity hint;
	Zero capacity hint;
	Complete cancel race;
	Handle after done;
	Process unicast subject test unicast subject test on error state peeking;
	Reject sync fusion;
	Cancel unicast subject test on arrival;
	Handle multi subscriber;
	Handle fused drain cancel;
	Dispose unicast subject test;
	Subscribe race;
	Check if unicast subject test has observers;
	Drain fused fail  fast;
	Drain fused fail  fast empty
