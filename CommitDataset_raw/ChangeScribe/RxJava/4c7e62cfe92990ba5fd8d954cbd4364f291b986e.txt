BUG - FEATURE: <type-ID> 

This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. 
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package io.reactivex.internal.operators.flowable:  

1.1. Add a class for flowable flatten iterable test. It allows to:

	Handle normal 0;
	Apply a integer;
	Apply v integer;
	Handle normal;
	Handle normal via flat map;
	Handle normal backpressured;
	Running running;
	Process flowable flatten iterable test flowable flatten iterable test as intermediate;
	Just flowable flatten iterable test;
	Handle just hidden;
	Handle empty;
	Handle error;
	Handle iterator has next throws immediately;
	Get iterator;
	Check if  has next;
	Handle next;
	Remove;
	Handle iterator has next throws immediately just;
	Handle iterator has next throws second call;
	Iterator next throws;
	Iterator next throws and unsubscribes;
	Handle mixture;
	Handle empty inner then single backpressured;
	Handle many empty inner then single backpressured;
	Check if flowable flatten iterable test has next is not called after child unsubscribed on next;
	Handle normal prefetch via flat map;
	Process flowable flatten iterable test flowable flatten iterable test with result selector max concurrent;
	Handle flat map iterable prefetch;
	Apply integer;
	Dispose flowable flatten iterable test;
	Apply;
	Handle bad source;
	Apply flowable;
	Handle callable throws;
	Call;
	Handle fusion methods;
	Process  on subscribe;
	Process  on next;
	Process  on error;
	Process  on complete;
	Handle small prefetch;
	Handle small prefetch 2;
	Handle mixed inner source;
	Handle mixed inner source 2;
	Handle fusion rejected;
	Get fused is empty with empty source;
	Get fused source crash;
	Take flowable flatten iterable test;
	Handle overflow source;
	Subscribe actual;
	One flowable flatten iterable test by one;
	Cancel flowable flatten iterable test after has next;
	Handle double share;
	Handle multi share;
	Handle multi share hidden;
	Failing inner cancels source;
	Accept v integer;
	Double flowable flatten iterable test on subscribe;
	Handle upstream fusion rejected;
	Get request fusion;
	Offer value integer;
	Offer v 1 integer;
	Get poll;
	Check if  is empty;
	Handle clear;
	Handle request;
	Cancel;
	Process flowable flatten iterable test flowable flatten iterable test on error late;
	Handle bad request;
	Handle fused current iterator empty;
	Handle fusion requested state
