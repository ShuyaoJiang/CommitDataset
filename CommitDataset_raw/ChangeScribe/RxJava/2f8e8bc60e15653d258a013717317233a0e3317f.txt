 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package io.reactivex:  

1. Changes to package io.reactivex.internal.operators.completable:  

1.1. Add a class for completable do finally test. It allows to:

	Handle normal empty;
	Handle normal error;
	Double completable do finally test on subscribe;
	Apply f completable;
	Handle null action;
	Handle action throws;
	Run;
	Handle disposed

2. Changes to package io.reactivex.internal.operators.maybe:  

2.1. Add a class for maybe do finally test. It allows to:

	Run maybe do finally test;
	Handle normal just;
	Handle normal empty;
	Handle normal error;
	Double maybe do finally test on subscribe;
	Apply f maybe;
	Handle normal just conditional;
	Handle normal empty conditional;
	Handle normal error conditional;
	Handle null action;
	Handle action throws;
	Run;
	Handle action throws conditional;
	Handle disposed

3. Changes to package io.reactivex.internal.operators.observable:  

3.1. Add a class for observable do finally test. It allows to:

	Run observable do finally test;
	Handle normal just;
	Handle normal empty;
	Handle normal error;
	Handle normal take;
	Double observable do finally test on subscribe;
	Apply f observable;
	Handle sync fused;
	Handle sync fused boundary;
	Handle async fused;
	Handle async fused boundary;
	Handle normal just conditional;
	Handle normal empty conditional;
	Handle normal error conditional;
	Handle normal take conditional;
	Handle sync fused conditional;
	Fused observable do finally test;
	Non fused conditional;
	Handle sync fused boundary conditional;
	Handle async fused conditional;
	Handle async fused boundary conditional;
	Handle null action;
	Handle action throws;
	Run;
	Handle action throws conditional;
	Handle clear is empty;
	Process  on subscribe;
	Process  on next;
	Process  on error;
	Process  on complete;
	Handle clear is empty conditional;
	Handle event ordering;
	Accept;
	Accept throwable;
	Convert event ordering;

4. Changes to package io.reactivex.internal.operators.single:  

4.1. Add a class for single do finally test. It allows to:

	Run single do finally test;
	Handle normal just;
	Handle normal error;
	Double single do finally test on subscribe;
