	Check if completable emitter is disposed;
	Try throwable on error

	Subscribe flowable emitter

1.4. Add an interface declaration  for observable emitter. It allows to:

	Set disposable;
	Set cancellable;
	Check if observable emitter is disposed;
	Serialize observable emitter;

	Try throwable on error

1.7. Add an interface declaration  for single on subscribe. It allows to:

3. Changes to package io.reactivex.internal.operators.completable:  

3.1. Add a class for completable create test. It allows to:

	Process  on complete;
	Process completable create test completable create test on complete throws;
	Process completable create test completable create test on error throws 2;
	Process completable create test completable create test on complete throws 2;
	Try completable create test on error;
	Convert emitter has;

4. Changes to package io.reactivex.internal.operators.observable:  

4.1. Add a class for observable create test. It allows to:

	Process observable create test observable create test on error crash;
	Process  on subscribe;
	Process  on next;
	Process  on error;
	Process  on complete;
	Process observable create test observable create test on complete crash;
	Get serialized;
	Get serialized concurrent on next;
	Run;
	Get serialized concurrent on next on error;
