BUG - FEATURE: <type-ID> 

This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. 
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package io.reactivex:  

1. Changes to package io.reactivex.internal.disposables:  

1. Changes to package io.reactivex.internal.operators.flowable:  

1.1. Add a class for flowable concat delay error test. It allows to:

	Handle main completes;
	Apply v integer;
	Handle main errors;
	Handle inner errors;
	Handle single inner errors;
	Handle inner null;
	Handle inner throws;
	Handle inner with empty;
	Handle inner with scalar;
	Handle backpressure;
	Process flowable concat delay error test flowable concat delay error test with error;
	Handle concat delay error flowable;
	Handle concat delay error flowable error;
	Handle concat delay error iterable;
	Handle concat delay error iterable error

1.2. Add a class for flowable detach test. It allows to:

	Just flowable detach test;
	Handle error;
	Handle empty;
	Handle range;
	Handle backpressured;
	Just unsubscribed;
	Get deferred upstream producer;
	Subscribe t subscriber;
	Dispose flowable detach test;
	Double flowable detach test on subscribe;
	Apply flowable

1.3. Add a class for flowable from array test. It allows to:

	Create flowable from array test;
	Handle simple;
	Handle backpressure;
	Handle conditional backpressure;
	Handle empty;
	Just flowable from array test;
	Just 10 arguments;
	Handle bad request;
	Handle conditional one is null;
	Handle conditional one is null slow path;
	Handle conditional one by one;
	Handle conditional filtered;
	Handle test;
	Handle conditional slow path cancel;
	Process  on next;
	Handle conditional slow path skip cancel;

1.4. Add a class for flowable from callable test. It allows to:

	Should flowable from callable test not invoke func until subscription;
	Handle should call on next and on completed;
	Should call  on error;
	Should flowable from callable test not deliver result if subscriber unsubscribed before emission;
	Answer invocation on mock;
	Convert should allow;
	Call;
	Get fused flat map execution;
	Apply v integer;
	Get fused flat map execution hidden;
	Get fused flat map null;
	Get fused flat map null hidden;
	Handle undeliverable upon cancellation;

1.5. Add a class for flowable join test. It allows to:

	Apply t 1 integer;
	Just flowable join test;
	Before flowable join test;
	Handle normal 1;
	Handle normal 1 with duration;
	Handle normal 2;
	Get left throws;
	Throws throws;
	Get left duration throws;
	Handle right duration throws;
	Get left duration selector throws;
	Handle right duration selector throws;
	Result selector throws;
	Dispose flowable join test;
	Apply a integer;
	Take flowable join test;
	Right flowable join test close;
	Result selector throws 2;
	Handle bad outer source;
	Subscribe actual;
	Handle bad end source;
	Backpressure overflow right;
	Handle backpressure overflow left;

1.6. Add a class for flowable to completable test. It allows to:

	Test flowable to completable test just single item observable;
	Handle test error observable;
	Test flowable to completable test just two emissions observable throws error;
	Handle test empty observable;
	Handle test never observable;
	Handle test should use unsafe subscribe internally not subscribe;
	Run

2. Changes to package io.reactivex.internal.operators.observable:  

2.1. Add a class for observable join test. It allows to:

	Apply t 1 integer;
	Just observable join test;
	Before observable join test;
	Handle normal 1;
	Handle normal 1 with duration;
	Handle normal 2;
	Get left throws;
	Throws throws;
	Get left duration throws;
	Handle right duration throws;
	Get left duration selector throws;
	Handle right duration selector throws;
	Result selector throws;
	Dispose observable join test;
	Apply a integer;
	Take observable join test;
	Right observable join test close;
	Result selector throws 2;
	Handle bad outer source;
	Subscribe actual;
	Handle bad end source;
