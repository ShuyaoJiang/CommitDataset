BUG - FEATURE: <type-ID> 

This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. 
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package io.reactivex:  

1. Changes to package io.reactivex.internal.observers:  

1.1. Add a class for lambda observer test. It allows to:

	Process lambda observer test lambda observer test on subscribe throws;
	Accept;
	Accept throwable;
	Run;
	Accept disposable;
	Process lambda observer test lambda observer test on next throws;
	Process lambda observer test lambda observer test on error throws;
	Process lambda observer test lambda observer test on complete throws;
	Handle bad source on subscribe;
	Subscribe actual;
	Handle bad source emit after done;
	Process lambda observer test lambda observer test on next throws cancels upstream;
	Accept v integer;
	Process lambda observer test lambda observer test on subscribe throws cancels upstream;
	Process lambda observer test lambda observer test on error missing should report no custom on error;
	Handle custom on error should report custom on error;
	Handle disposed observer should report error on global error handler;

2. Changes to package io.reactivex.internal.operators.flowable:  

2. Changes to package io.reactivex.internal.operators.observable:  

2. Changes to package io.reactivex.internal.subscribers:  

2.1. Add a class for basic fuseable conditional subscriber test. It allows to:

	Throws basic fuseable conditional subscriber test;
	Process  on subscribe;
	Process  on next;
	Process  on error;
	Process  on complete;
	Try integer on next;
	Get request fusion;
	Get poll

2.2. Add a class for basic fuseable subscriber test. It allows to:

	Throws basic fuseable subscriber test;
	Process  on next;
	Get request fusion;
	Get poll

2.3. Add a class for inner queued subscriber test. It allows to:

	Handle request in batches;
	Handle inner next;
	Handle inner error;
	Handle inner complete;
	Drain;
	Handle request;
	Cancel

2.4. Add a class for single post complete subscriber test. It allows to:

	Handle request complete race;
	Process  on next;
	Process  on error;
	Process  on complete;
	Run;

3. Changes to package io.reactivex.observable:
