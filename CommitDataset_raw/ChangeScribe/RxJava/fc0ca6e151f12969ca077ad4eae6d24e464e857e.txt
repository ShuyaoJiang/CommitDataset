BUG - FEATURE: <type-ID> 

This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. 
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package io.reactivex:  

1. Changes to package io.reactivex.exceptions:  

1. Changes to package io.reactivex.internal.operators.flowable:  

1. Changes to package io.reactivex.internal.subscribers:  

1.1. Add a class for bounded subscriber. It allows to:

	Instantiate bounded subscriber  with on next consumer, on error consumer, on complete action, on subscribe consumer and on subscribe consumer;
	Process bounded subscriber bounded subscriber on subscribe;
	Process bounded subscriber bounded subscriber on next;
	Process bounded subscriber bounded subscriber on error;
	Process bounded subscriber bounded subscriber on complete;
	Dispose bounded subscriber;
	Check if bounded subscriber is disposed;
	Handle request;
	Cancel bounded subscriber;
	Check if bounded subscriber has custom on error

1.2. Add a class for bounded subscriber test. It allows to:

	Process bounded subscriber test bounded subscriber test on subscribe throws;
	Accept;
	Accept throwable;
	Run;
	Accept subscription;
	Process bounded subscriber test bounded subscriber test on next throws;
	Process bounded subscriber test bounded subscriber test on error throws;
	Process bounded subscriber test bounded subscriber test on complete throws;
	Process bounded subscriber test bounded subscriber test on next throws cancels upstream;
	Accept v integer;
	Process bounded subscriber test bounded subscriber test on subscribe throws cancels upstream;
	Handle bad source on subscribe;
	Subscribe subscriber;
	Handle bad source emit after done;
	Process bounded subscriber test bounded subscriber test on error missing should report no custom on error;
	Handle custom on error should report custom on error
