This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. 
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package io.reactivex:  

1. Changes to package io.reactivex.internal.observers:  

1. Changes to package io.reactivex.internal.operators.flowable:  

1. Changes to package io.reactivex.internal.schedulers:  

1.1. Add an interface declaration  for non blocking thread

2. Changes to package io.reactivex.internal.subscribers:  

2. Changes to package io.reactivex.internal.util:  

2. Changes to package io.reactivex.plugins:  

2. Changes to package io.reactivex.schedulers:  

2.1. Add a class for fail on blocking test. It allows to:

	Fail computation flowable blocking  first;
	Apply v integer;
	Fail computation flowable blocking last;
	Fail computation flowable blocking iterable;
	Fail computation flowable blocking subscribe;
	Fail computation flowable blocking single;
	Fail computation flowable blocking  for each;
	Fail computation flowable blocking latest;
	Fail computation flowable blocking next;
	Fail computation flowable  to future;
	Fail computation observable blocking  first;
	Fail computation observable blocking last;
	Fail computation observable blocking iterable;
	Fail computation observable blocking subscribe;
	Fail computation observable blocking single;
	Fail computation observable blocking  for each;
	Fail computation observable blocking latest;
	Fail computation observable blocking next;
	Fail computation observable  to future;
	Fail single observable blocking  first;
	Fail single single blocking get;
	Fail single  maybe blocking get;
	Fail single completable blocking get;
	Run;
	Fail single completable blocking await;
	Handle dontfail IO observable blocking first;
	Fail fail on blocking test with custom handler;
	Get  as boolean;

3. Changes to package io.reactivex.tck:
