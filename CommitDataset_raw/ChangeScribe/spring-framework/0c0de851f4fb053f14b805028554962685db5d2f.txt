 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package org.springframework.core.io.buffer:  

1.1. Add a class for leak aware data buffer. It allows to:

	Instantiate leak aware data buffer  with delegate data buffer, leak aware data buffer factory and leak aware data buffer factory;
	Create leak error;
	Leak error;
	Check if leak aware data buffer is allocated;
	Retain leak aware data buffer;
	Handle release;
	Get factory;
	Get index of;
	Handle last index of;
	Handle readable byte count;
	Handle writable byte count;
	Read position;
	Write position;
	Get capacity;
	Ensure capacity;
	Get byte;
	Read leak aware data buffer;
	Write leak aware data buffer;
	Write buffers;
	Write char sequence;
	Get slice;
	Process leak aware data buffer leak aware data buffer as byte buffer;
	Process leak aware data buffer leak aware data buffer as input stream;
	Process leak aware data buffer leak aware data buffer as output stream;
	Check if leak aware data buffer equals;
	Hash code;
	Convert leak aware data buffer to string

1.2. Add a class for leak aware data buffer factory. It allows to:

	Instantiate leak aware data buffer factory;
	Instantiate leak aware data buffer factory  with delegate data buffer factory;
	Check leak aware data buffer factory for leaks;
	Allocate buffer;
	Allocate buffer internal;
	Wrap byte buffer;
	Wrap leak aware data buffer factory;
	Join data buffers list
