This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. This commit  includes changes to internationalization, properties or configuration files (springFactoriesLoaderTests.properties). 
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package org.springframework.core.io.support:  

1.1. Add a class for dummy package private factory

1.2. Add a class for spring factories loader tests. It allows to:

	Load factories  in correct order;
	Load package private factory;
