	Check if matrix variable map method argument resolver supports parameter;
	Resolve argument value;
	Check if matrix variable map method argument resolver is single value map

1.2. Add a class for matrix variables map method argument resolver tests. It allows to:

	Set matrix variables map method argument resolver tests;
	Check if matrix variables map method argument resolver tests supports parameter;
	Resolve argument;
	Resolve argument path variable;
	Resolve argument no params;
	Resolve argument no match;
	Get matrix variables;
	Handle map

1.3. Add a class for matrix variables method argument resolver tests. It allows to:

	Set matrix variables method argument resolver tests;
	Check if matrix variables method argument resolver tests supports parameter;
	Resolve argument;
	Resolve argument path variable;
	Resolve argument default value;
	Resolve argument multiple matches;
	Resolve argument required;
