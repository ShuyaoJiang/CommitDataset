1.1. Add a class for abstract async client http request. It allows to:

	Get headers;
	Get body;
	Execute async;
	Assert abstract async client http request not executed;
	Get body internal;
	Execute internal

1.2. Add a class for abstract async http request factory test case. It allows to:

	Destroy factory;
	Create request factory;
	Handle status;
	Handle status callback;
	Process  on success;
	Process  on failure;
	Echo abstract async http request factory test case;
	Handle multiple writes;
	Handle headers after execute;
	Http methods;
	Assert http method;
	Cancel abstract async http request factory test case

1.3. Add a class for abstract buffering async client http request. It allows to:

	Get body internal;
	Execute internal;

1.4. Add an interface declaration  for async client http request. It allows to:

	Execute async

1.5. Add an interface declaration  for async client http request factory. It allows to:

	Create async request

1.6. Add a class for buffered simple async http request factory tests. It allows to:

	Create request factory;
	Http methods

1.7. Add a class for http components async client http request factory. It allows to:

	Instantiate http components async client http request factory;
	Instantiate http components async client http request factory  with http async client;
	Instantiate http components async client http request factory  with closeable http async client;
	Instantiate http components async client http request factory  with http client, http async client and http async client;
	Instantiate http components async client http request factory  with closeable http client, closeable http async client and closeable http async client;
	Set async client;
	Get async client;
	Set http async client;
	Get http async client;
	Handle after properties set;
	Start async client;
	Create async request;
	Destroy http components async client http request factory

1.8. Add a class for http components async client http request factory tests. It allows to:

	Create request factory;
	Http methods;
	Handle custom http async client uses its default;
	Handle default settings of http async client lost on executor customization

1.9. Add a class for simple buffering async client http request. It allows to:

	Instantiate simple buffering async client http request  with http URL connection, async listenable task executor and async listenable task executor;
	Get method value;
	Get URI;
	Execute internal;
	Call

1.10. Add a class for simple streaming async client http request. It allows to:

	Instantiate simple streaming async client http request  with http URL connection, async listenable task executor and async listenable task executor;
	Get method value;
	Get URI;
	Get body internal;
	Execute internal;
	Call

2. Changes to package org.springframework.http.client.support:  

2.1. Add a class for async http accessor. It allows to:

	Set async request factory;
	Get async request factory;
	Create async request

3. Changes to package org.springframework.web.client:  

3.1. Add an interface declaration  for async request callback. It allows to:

	Do org springframework http client async client http request with request

3.2. Add an interface declaration  for async rest operations. It allows to:

	Get rest operations;
	Get response type class for entity;
	Get url URI for entity;
	Head async rest operations for headers;
	Head uri variables map for headers;
	Head url URI for headers;
	Post request http entity for location;
	Post url URI for location;
	Post request http entity for entity;
