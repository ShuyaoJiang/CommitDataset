1.4. Add a class for before test class event. It allows to:

	Instantiate before test class event  with source test context

1.5. Add a class for before test execution event. It allows to:

	Instantiate before test execution event  with source test context

1.6. Add a class for before test method event. It allows to:

	Process event publishing test execution listener event publishing test execution listener before test execution;
	Process event publishing test execution listener event publishing test execution listener after test execution;
	Process event publishing test execution listener event publishing test execution listener after test method;
	Process event publishing test execution listener event publishing test execution listener after test class

1.8. Add a class for event publishing test execution listener tests. It allows to:

	Check if event publishing test execution listener tests does not publish after test class event if application context has not been loaded;
	Assert event;
	Assert no event

1.9. Add a class for prepare test instance event. It allows to:

	Instantiate prepare test instance event  with source test context
