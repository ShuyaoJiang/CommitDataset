	Parse X content parser;
	Get type

1.2. Add an object creator class for geo tile grid aggregator. It allows to:

	Instantiate geo tile grid aggregator  with aggregator factories, values source, aggregation context, parent aggregator, pipeline aggregators list, meta data map and meta data map;

	Build empty aggregation;
	Do create internal

1.4. Add a class for geo tile grid aggregator tests. It allows to:

	Handle random precision;
	Hash geo tile grid aggregator tests as string;
	Create builder;

1.5. Add a class for geo tile grid parser tests. It allows to:

	Handle test parse valid from ints;
	Handle test parse valid from strings;
	Handle test parse error on boolean precision;
	Handle test parse error on precision out of range

1.6. Add a class for geo tile grid tests. It allows to:

	Create internal geo grid;
	Get instance reader;
	Create internal geo grid bucket;
	Encode encode;

	Encode encode;
	Parse hash;
	Encode geo tile utils;
	Hash geo tile utils to geo point;
	Handle key to geo point;
	Validate ZXY;
	Convert zxy

1.8. Add a class for geo tile utils tests. It allows to:

	Handle test check precision range;

	Handle test string encode;
	Handle test geo tile as long routines;
	Handle test singularity at poles

1.9. Add a class for internal geo tile grid. It allows to:

	Instantiate internal geo tile grid  with stream input;
	Create buckets list;
	Create bucket;
	Get bucket reader;
	Get writeable name

1.10. Add a class for internal geo tile grid bucket. It allows to:

	Instantiate internal geo tile grid bucket  with internal aggregations;
	Instantiate internal geo tile grid bucket  with stream input;
	Build bucket;
	Get key  as string;
	Get key

1.11. Add a class for parsed geo tile grid. It allows to:

	Process parsed geo tile grid parsed geo tile grid from X content;
	Get type

1.12. Add a class for parsed geo tile grid bucket. It allows to:

	Get key;
	Get key  as string;
