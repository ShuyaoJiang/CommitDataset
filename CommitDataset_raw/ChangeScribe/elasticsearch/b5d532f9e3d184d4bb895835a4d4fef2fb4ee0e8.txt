This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. 
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package org.elasticsearch.index.mapper:  

1.1. Add a class for dense vector field mapper tests. It allows to:

	Set up mapper;
	Get plugins;
	Handle test defaults;
	Handle test dimension limit

1.2. Add an object creator class for dense vector field type tests. It allows to:

	Create default field type

1.3. Add a class for sparse vector field mapper tests. It allows to:

	Set up mapper;
	Get plugins;
	Handle test defaults;
	Handle test dimension number validation;
	Handle test dimension limit

1.4. Add an object creator class for sparse vector field type tests. It allows to:

	Create default field type

1.5. Add a class for vector encoder decoder. It allows to:

	Instantiate vector encoder decoder;
	Encode sparse vector;
	Decode sparse vector dims;
	Decode sparse vector;
	Sort sparse dims values;
	Compare;
	Handle swap;
	Sort sparse dims double values;
	Decode dense vector

1.6. Add a class for vector encoder decoder tests. It allows to:

	Handle test dense vector encoding decoding;
	Handle test sparse vector encoding decoding;
	Handle mock encode dense vector;
	Handle random unique dims
