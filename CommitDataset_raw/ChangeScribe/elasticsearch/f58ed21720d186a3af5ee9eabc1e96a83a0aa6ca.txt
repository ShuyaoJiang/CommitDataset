	Instantiate bulk primary execution context  with bulk shard request, primary index shard and primary index shard;
	Find next non aborted;
	Check if bulk primary execution context is aborted;
	Handle advance;
	Assert invariants;
	Get current;
	Get bulk shard request;
	Get execution result;
	Get retry counter;
	Check if bulk primary execution context is operation executed;
	Check if bulk primary execution context requires waiting for mapping update;
	Check if bulk primary execution context requires immediate retry;
	Check if bulk primary execution context is completed;
	Check if bulk primary execution context is initial;
	Check if bulk primary execution context has more operations to execute;
	Get concrete index;
	Get location  to sync;
	Get current item;
	Get primary;
	Set request  to execute;
	Get request  to execute;
	Handle mark as requiring mapping update;
	Reset bulk primary execution context for execution for retry;
	Handle mark operation as no op;
	Fail cause exception on mapping update;
	Handle mark operation as executed;
	Handle mark as completed;
	Build shard response;

1.2. Add a class for bulk primary execution context tests. It allows to:
