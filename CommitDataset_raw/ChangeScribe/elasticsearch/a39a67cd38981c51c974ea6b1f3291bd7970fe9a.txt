2. Changes to package org.elasticsearch.xpack.ml.job.process.autodetect.output:  

2.1. Add a class for autodetect state processor. It allows to:

	Instantiate autodetect state processor  with client;
	Handle process;
	Split bytes reference;
	Persist bytes reference;
	Find next zero byte

2.2. Add a class for autodetect state processor tests. It allows to:

	Initialize autodetect state processor tests;
	Verify no more client interactions;
	Handle test state read;
	Handle test state read given consecutive zero bytes;
	Handle test state read given consecutive spaces followed by zero byte;
	Test large state read

3. Changes to package org.elasticsearch.xpack.ml.job.process.autodetect.writer:  

3. Changes to package org.elasticsearch.xpack.ml.job.process.normalizer:  

3. Changes to package org.elasticsearch.xpack.ml.job.process.normalizer.output:  

3. Changes to package org.elasticsearch.xpack.ml.process:  

3.1. Add a class for abstract native process. It allows to:

	Instantiate abstract native process  with log stream, process in stream, process out stream, process restore stream, files to delete list, on process crash consumer and on process crash consumer;
	Get name;
	Start executor service;
	Check if abstract native process is ready;
	Set ready;
	Write record;
	Handle flush stream;
	Close abstract native process;
	Kill abstract native process;
	Delete associated files;
	Get process start time;
	Check if abstract native process is process alive;
	Check if abstract native process is process alive after waiting;
	Read error;
	Get job id;
	Process out stream;
	Get process restore stream;
	Get number of fields;
	Record writer;
	Check if abstract native process is process killed

3.2. Rename type NativeController with NativeController

3.3. Rename type NativeControllerHolder with NativeControllerHolder

3.4. Rename type NativeControllerTests with NativeControllerTests

3.5. Add an interface declaration  for native process. It allows to:

	Check if native process is ready;
	Write record;
	Persist state;
	Handle flush stream;
	Kill native process;
	Get process start time;
	Check if native process is process alive;
	Check if native process is process alive after waiting;
	Read error

3.6. Rename type NativeStorageProvider with NativeStorageProvider

3.7. Rename type NativeStorageProviderTests with NativeStorageProviderTests

3.8. Rename type ProcessPipes with ProcessPipes

3.9. Rename type ProcessPipesTests with ProcessPipesTests

3.10. Add an interface declaration  for state processor. It allows to:

	Handle process
