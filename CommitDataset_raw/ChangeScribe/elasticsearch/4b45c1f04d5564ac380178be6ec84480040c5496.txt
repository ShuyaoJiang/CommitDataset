This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. 
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package org.elasticsearch.xpack.core.dataframe:  

1. Changes to package org.elasticsearch.xpack.core.dataframe.transforms:  

1.1. Add a class for data frame transform checkpoint. It allows to:

	Create parser;
	Instantiate data frame transform checkpoint  with checkpoints map;
	Instantiate data frame transform checkpoint  with stream input;
	Convert data frame transform checkpoint to X content;
	Get transform id;
	Get timestamp;
	Get checkpoint;
	Get indices checkpoints;
	Get time upper bound;
	Write  to stream output;
	Check if data frame transform checkpoint equals;
	Handle matches;
	Hash code;
	Process data frame transform checkpoint data frame transform checkpoint from X content;
	Document id;
	Read checkpoints

1.2. Add a class for data frame transform checkpoint tests. It allows to:

	Handle random data frame transform checkpoints;
	Do parse instance;
	Create test instance;
	Get instance reader;
	Get data frame transform checkpoint tests to X content params;
	Handle test X content for internal storage;
	Handle test X content for api usage;
	Handle test matches;
	Handle random checkpoints by index

2. Changes to package org.elasticsearch.xpack.dataframe:
