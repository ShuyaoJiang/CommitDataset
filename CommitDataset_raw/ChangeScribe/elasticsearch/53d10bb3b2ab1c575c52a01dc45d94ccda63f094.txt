2. Changes to package org.elasticsearch.client.security.support.expressiondsl.expressions:  

2.1. Add a class for composite role mapper expression. It allows to:

	Instantiate composite role mapper expression  with elements role mapper expression;
	Get name;
	Get elements;
	Check if composite role mapper expression equals;
	Hash code;
	Convert composite role mapper expression to X content

2.2. Add a class for except role mapper expression. It allows to:

	Instantiate except role mapper expression  with role mapper expression;
	Convert except role mapper expression to X content

3. Changes to package org.elasticsearch.client.security.support.expressiondsl.fields:  

3.1. Add a class for field role mapper expression. It allows to:
