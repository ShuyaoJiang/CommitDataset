 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package org.elasticsearch.index.engine:  

1.1. Add a class for read only engine. It allows to:

	Instantiate read only engine  with engine config, seq no stats, translog stats, reader wrapper function and reader wrapper function;
	Assert max seq no equals  to global checkpoint;
	Verify engine  before index closing;
	Wrap reader;
	Handle open;
	Get docs stats;
	Close no lock;
	Build seq no stats;
	Get get;
	Get reference manager;
	Get last committed segment infos;
	Get history UUID;
	Get writing bytes;
	Get index throttle time  in millis;
	Check if read only engine is throttled;
	Get index;
	Delete delete;
	No op;
	Check if read only engine is translog sync needed;
	Ensure translog synced;
	Handle sync translog;
	Acquire retention lock;
	Handle new changes snapshot;
	Read history operations;
	Estimate number  of history operations;
	Check if read only engine has complete operation history;
	Get min retained seq no;
	Get translog stats;
	Get translog last write location;
	Get local checkpoint;
	Get seq no stats;
	Get last synced global checkpoint;
	Get index buffer RAM bytes used;
	Get segments;
	Refresh read only engine;
	Refresh refresh;
	Write indexing buffer;
	Should read only engine periodically flush;
	Get sync flush;
	Handle flush;
	Merge read only engine;
	Acquire last index commit;
	Acquire safe index commit;
	Throttling read only engine;
	Handle trim unreferenced translog files;
	Should roll translog generation;
	Roll translog generation;
	Restore local history  from translog;
	Fill seq no gaps;
	Recover translog recovery runner from translog;
	Skip translog recovery;
	Trim operations  from translog;
	Maybe prune deletes;
	Handle doc stats;
	Update max unsafe auto id timestamp;
	Handle reinitialize max seq no of updates or deletes;
	Handle process readers;
	Needed read only engine;
	Handle new empty snapshot;
	Close;
	Handle total operations;
	Handle next

1.2. Add a class for read only engine tests. It allows to:

	Handle test read only engine;
	Handle test flushes;
	Convert test ensure max seq no is equal;
	Handle test read only;
	Handle test verify shard before index closing is no op;
	Handle test recover from translog applies no operations
