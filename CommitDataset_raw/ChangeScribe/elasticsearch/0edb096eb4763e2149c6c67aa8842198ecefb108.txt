	Build empty aggregation;
	Do auto date histogram aggregator close

2.2. Add a class for auto date histogram aggregator factory. It allows to:

	Instantiate auto date histogram aggregator factory  with values source config, rounding infos, search context, parent aggregator factory, sub factories builder, meta data map and meta data map;
	Do create internal;
	Create aggregator;
	Create unmapped

2.3. Add a class for auto date histogram aggregator tests. It allows to:

	Handle test search case;
	Handle test search and reduce case;
	Test both cases;
	Create index settings;
	Execute test case

2.4. Add a class for internal auto date histogram tests. It allows to:
