This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. This commit  renames some files.
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package org.elasticsearch.index.rankeval:  

1.1. Add an interface declaration  for evaluation metric. It allows to:

	Evaluate hits;
	Join hits  with ratings;
	Get filter unrated documents;
	Combine partial results collection;
	Get forced search size

1.2. Add a class for mean reciprocal rank tests. It allows to:

	Handle test parse from X content;
	Handle test max acceptable rank;
	Handle test evaluation one relevant in results;
	Handle test precision at five relevance threshold;
	Handle test combine;
	Handle test evaluation no relevant in results;
	Handle test no results;
	Handle test X content roundtrip;
	Handle test X content parsing is not lenient;
	Create search hits;
	Create test item;
	Handle test serialization;
	Handle test equals and hash;
	Get copy;
	Mutate test item mean reciprocal rank;
	Handle test invalid relevant threshold;
	Handle test invalid K

1.3. Add a class for precision at K tests. It allows to:

	Handle test precision at five calculation;
	Handle test precision at five ignore one result;
	Handle test precision at five relevance threshold;
	Handle test precision at five correct index;
	Handle test ignore unlabeled;
	Handle test no rated docs;
	Handle test no results;
	Handle test parse from X content;
	Handle test combine;
	Handle test invalid relevant threshold;
	Handle test invalid K;
	Create test item;
	Handle test X content roundtrip;
	Handle test X content parsing is not lenient;
	Handle test serialization;
	Handle test equals and hash;
	Get copy;
	Mutate original precision at;
	Convert precision at K tests to search hits;
	Create rated doc
