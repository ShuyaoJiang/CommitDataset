	Do save state;
	Process async two phase indexer async two phase indexer on failure;
	Process async two phase indexer async two phase indexer on finish;
	Process async two phase indexer async two phase indexer on abort;
	Finish exception with search failure;
	Finish exception with indexing failure;
	Finish and set state;
	Process async two phase indexer async two phase indexer on search response;
	Process async two phase indexer async two phase indexer on bulk response;
	Check state

1.2. Add a class for indexer job stats. It allows to:

	Instantiate indexer job stats;

	Check if indexer job stats equals;
	Hash code

1.3. Rename type IndexerStateEnumTests with IndexerStateEnumTests

1.4. Add a class for iteration result. It allows to:
