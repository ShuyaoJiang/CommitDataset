BUG - FEATURE: <type-ID> 

This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. 
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package org.springframework.boot.loader.jar:  

1.1. Add a class for string sequence. It allows to:

	Instantiate string sequence;
	Get sub sequence;
	Check if string sequence is empty;
	Get length;
	Char string sequence at;
	Get index of;
	Starts  with prefix char sequence;
	Check if string sequence equals;
	Hash code;
	Convert string sequence to string

1.2. Add a class for string sequence tests. It allows to:

	Create when source is null should throw exception;
	Create string sequence tests with index when source is null should throw exception;
	Create when start is less  than zero should throw exception;
	Create when end is greater  than length should throw exception;
	Create string sequence tests from string;
	Handle sub sequence with just start should return sub sequence;
	Handle sub sequence should return sub sequence;
	Handle sub sequence when called multiple times should return sub sequence;
	Handle sub sequence when end past existing end should throw exception;
	Handle sub sequence when start past existing end should throw exception;
	Check if string sequence tests is empty when empty should return true;
	Check if string sequence tests is empty when not empty should return false;
	Handle length should return length;
	Char string sequence tests at should return char;
	Handle index of char should return index of;
	Handle index of string should return index of;
	Handle index of string from index should return index of;
	Hash code should be same  as string;
	Check if string sequence tests equals when same content should match;
	Not equals when sequences  of different length;
	Starts string sequence tests with when exact match;
	Starts string sequence tests with when longer and starts with;
	Starts string sequence tests with when longer and does not start with;
	Starts string sequence tests with when shorter and does not start with;
	Starts string sequence tests with offset when exact match;
	Starts string sequence tests with offset when longer and starts with;
	Starts string sequence tests with offset when longer and does not start with;
	Starts string sequence tests with offset when shorter and does not start with
