BUG - FEATURE: <type-ID> 

This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. 
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package io.netty.buffer:  

1.1. Add a class for abstract unsafe swapped byte buf. It allows to:

	Instantiate abstract unsafe swapped byte buf  with abstract byte buf;
	Get abstract unsafe swapped byte buf long;
	Get float;
	Get abstract unsafe swapped byte buf double;
	Get char;
	Get unsigned int;
	Get int;
	Get unsigned short;
	Get short;
	Set short;
	Set int;
	Set abstract unsafe swapped byte buf long;
	Set char;
	Set float;
	Set double;
	Write short;
	Write int;
	Write abstract unsafe swapped byte buf long;
	Write char;
	Write float;
	Write double;
	Get  long wrapped abstract byte buf;
	Set  long wrapped abstract byte buf

1.2. Add a class for pooled unsafe heap byte buf. It allows to:

	Handle new object;
	Handle new unsafe instance;
	Instantiate pooled unsafe heap byte buf  with recycler handle;
	Get byte;
	Get short;
	Get short LE;
	Get unsigned medium;
	Get unsigned medium LE;
	Get int;
	Get int LE;
	Get pooled unsafe heap byte buf long;
	Get pooled unsafe heap byte buf long LE;
	Set byte;
	Set short;
	Set short LE;
	Set medium;
	Set medium LE;
	Set int;
	Set int LE;
	Set pooled unsafe heap byte buf long;
	Set long LE;
	Set pooled unsafe heap byte buf;
	Write pooled unsafe heap byte buf;
	Handle new swapped byte buf

1.3. Add a class for unpooled unsafe heap byte buf. It allows to:

	Instantiate unpooled unsafe heap byte buf  with byte buf allocator;
	Allocate array;
	Get byte;
	Get short;
	Get short LE;
	Get unsigned medium;
	Get unsigned medium LE;
	Get int;
	Get int LE;
	Get unpooled unsafe heap byte buf long;
	Get unpooled unsafe heap byte buf long LE;
	Set byte;
	Set short;
	Set short LE;
	Set medium;
	Set medium LE;
	Set int;
	Set int LE;
	Set unpooled unsafe heap byte buf long;
	Set long LE;
	Set unpooled unsafe heap byte buf;
	Write unpooled unsafe heap byte buf;
	Handle new swapped byte buf

1.4. Add a class for unsafe heap swapped byte buf. It allows to:

	Instantiate unsafe heap swapped byte buf  with abstract byte buf;
	Get idx;
	Get  long wrapped abstract byte buf;
	Get int;
	Get short;
	Set short;
	Set int;
	Set  long wrapped abstract byte buf

2. Changes to package io.netty.util.internal:
