BUG - FEATURE: <type-ID> 

This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. 
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package io.netty.channel:

	Handle last partial read does not ramp down;
	Handle last partial read can ramp up;
	Handle alloc read expected;
	Handle alloc read
