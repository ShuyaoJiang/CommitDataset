BUG - FEATURE: <type-ID> 

This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. This commit  includes changes to internationalization, properties or configuration files (pom.xml).  renames some files.
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package io.netty.handler.codec.compression:  

1.1. Add a class for abstract compression test. It allows to:

	Fill array  with compressible data

1.2. Add a class for abstract decoder test. It allows to:

	Instantiate abstract decoder test;
	Compress abstract decoder test;
	Handle init channel;
	Destroy channel;
	Handle small data;
	Handle large data;
	Handle test decompression of small chunk of data;
	Handle test decompression of large chunk of data;
	Handle test decompression of batched flow of data;
	Handle test decompression;
	Handle test decompression of batched flow;
	Decompressed embedded channel;
	Try decode and catch buf leaks

1.3. Add a class for abstract encoder test. It allows to:

	Get decompress;
	Handle init channel;
	Destroy channel;
	Handle small data;
	Handle large data;
	Handle test compression of small chunk of data;
	Handle test compression of large chunk of data;
	Handle test compression of batched flow of data;
	Handle test compression;
	Handle test compression of batched flow;
	Decompressed abstract encoder test

1.4. Add a class for abstract integration test. It allows to:

	Create encoder;
	Create decoder;
	Handle init channels;
	Close channels;
	Handle test empty;
	Handle test one byte;
	Test two bytes;
	Handle test regular;
	Test large random;
	Handle test part random;
	Handle test compressible;
	Handle test long blank;
	Handle test long same;
	Handle test sequential;
	Handle test identity
