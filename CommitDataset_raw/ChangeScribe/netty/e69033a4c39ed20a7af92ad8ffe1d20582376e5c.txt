This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. This commit  renames some files.
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package io.netty.channel:  

1.1. Add an interface declaration  for channel progressive future. It allows to:

	Add listener;
	Add listeners;
	Remove listener;
	Remove listeners;
	Get sync;
	Get sync uninterruptibly;
	Await channel progressive future;
	Await uninterruptibly

1.2. Add an interface declaration  for channel progressive future listener

1.3. Add an interface declaration  for channel progressive promise. It allows to:

	Add listener;
	Add listeners;
	Remove listener;
	Remove listeners;
	Get sync;
	Get sync uninterruptibly;
	Await channel progressive promise;
	Await uninterruptibly;
	Set success;
	Set failure;
	Set progress;
	Handle unvoid

1.4. Add a class for default channel progressive promise. It allows to:

	Instantiate default channel progressive promise  with channel;
	Instantiate default channel progressive promise  with channel, event executor and event executor;
	Get executor;
	Get channel;
	Set success;
	Try success;
	Set failure;
	Set progress;
	Add listener;
	Add listeners;
	Remove listener;
	Remove listeners;
	Get sync;
	Get sync uninterruptibly;
	Await default channel progressive promise;
	Await uninterruptibly;
	Handle flush checkpoint;
	Get promise;
	Check dead lock;
	Handle unvoid;
	Check if default channel progressive promise is void

2. Changes to package io.netty.channel.oio:  

2. Changes to package io.netty.util.concurrent:  

2.1. Add a class for default future listeners. It allows to:

	Instantiate default future listeners  with first generic future listener, second generic future listener and second generic future listener;
	Add generic future listener;
	Remove generic future listener;
	Get listeners;
	Get size;
	Handle progressive size

2.2. Add a class for default progressive promise. It allows to:

	Instantiate default progressive promise  with event executor;

	Remove listener;
	Remove listeners;
	Get sync;
	Get sync uninterruptibly;
	Await default progressive promise;
	Await uninterruptibly;
	Set success;
	Set failure

2.3. Add an interface declaration  for generic progressive future listener. It allows to:

	Handle operation progressed

2.4. Add an interface declaration  for progressive future. It allows to:

	Add listener;
	Add listeners;
	Remove listener;
	Remove listeners;
	Get sync;
	Get sync uninterruptibly;
	Await progressive future;
	Await uninterruptibly

2.5. Add an interface declaration  for progressive promise. It allows to:

	Set progress;
	Try progress;
	Set success;
	Set failure;
	Add listener;
	Add listeners;
	Remove listener;
	Remove listeners;
	Await progressive promise;
	Await uninterruptibly;
