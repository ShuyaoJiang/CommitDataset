This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. This commit  includes changes to internationalization, properties or configuration files (NOTICE.txt, pom.xml, LICENSE.jbzip2.txt, ... ). 
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package io.netty.handler.codec.compression:  

1.1. Add a class for bzip 2 block decompressor. It allows to:

	Instantiate bzip 2 block decompressor  with bzip 2 bit reader;
	Decode huffman data;
	Handle initialise inverse BWT;
	Read bzip 2 block decompressor;
	Decode next BWT byte;
	Block length;
	Check CRC

1.2. Add a class for bzip 2 constants. It allows to:

	Instantiate bzip 2 constants

1.3. Add a class for bzip 2 decoder. It allows to:

	Decode ctx channel handler context;
	Check if bzip 2 decoder is closed

1.4. Add a class for bzip 2 decoder test. It allows to:

	Instantiate bzip 2 decoder test;
	Handle init channel;
	Write inbound destroy and expect decompression exception;
	Handle test unexpected stream identifier;
	Handle test invalid block size;
	Handle test bad block header;
	Handle test stream crc error of empty block;
	Handle test stream crc error;
	Handle test incorrect huffman groups number;
	Handle test incorrect selectors number;
	Handle test block crc error;
	Handle test start pointer invalid;
	Compress bzip 2 decoder test

1.5. Add a class for bzip 2 huffman stage decoder. It allows to:

	Instantiate bzip 2 huffman stage decoder  with bzip 2 bit reader;
	Create huffman decoding tables;
	Handle next symbol

1.6. Add a class for bzip 2 move to front table. It allows to:

	Convert value;
	Convert index

1.7. Add a class for bzip 2 rand. It allows to:

	R nums;
	Instantiate bzip 2 rand

1.8. Add a class for crc 32. It allows to:

	Get CRC;
	Update CRC;
