BUG - FEATURE: <type-ID> 

This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. This commit  renames some files.
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package io.netty.handler.codec.http2:  

1.1. Add a class for abstract weighted fair queue byte distributor dependency test. It allows to:

	Get stream;
	Write answer;
	Answer invocation on mock;
	Handle init state;
	Set priority

1.2. Add a class for weighted fair queue byte distributor dependency tree test. It allows to:

	Handle setup;
	Closing stream  with children does not cause concurrent modification;
	Close weighted fair queue byte distributor dependency tree test while iterating does not NPE;
	Handle visit;
	Handle local stream can depend upon idle stream;
	Handle remote stream can depend upon idle stream;
	Prioritize should use defaults;
	Reprioritize weighted fair queue byte distributor dependency tree test with no change should do nothing;
	Handle state only priority should be preserved when streams are created and closed;
	Verify state  only priority should be preserved when streams are created;
	Handle fire fox qo S streams remain after data streams are closed;
	Verify fire fox qo S streams;
	Handle lowest precedence state should be dropped;
	Verify lowest precedence state should be dropped 1;
	Verify lowest precedence state should be dropped 2;
	Verify lowest precedence state should be dropped 3;
	Verify lowest precedence state should be dropped 4;
	Verify lowest precedence state should be dropped 5;
	Handle priority only streams are preserved when reserved streams are closed;
	Insert exclusive should add new level;
	Existing child made exclusive should  not create tree cycle;
	Handle new exclusive child should update old parent correctly;
	Weight change  with no tree change should be respected;
	Handle same node dependent should not stack overflow nor change prioritizable for tree;
	Handle multiple circular dependency should update prioritizable;
	Remove weighted fair queue byte distributor dependency tree test with prioritizable dependents should not restructure tree;
	Close weighted fair queue byte distributor dependency tree test with no prioritizable dependents should restructure tree;
	Handle priority change with no prioritizable dependents should restructure tree;
	Handle circular dependency should restructure tree;
	Handle circular dependency with exclusive should restructure tree;
	Handle unknown parent should be created under connection

2. Changes to package io.netty.microbench.http2:  

2. Changes to package io.netty.util.internal:  

2.1. Add a class for empty priority queue. It allows to:

	Instantiate empty priority queue;
	Get instance;
	Typed node;
	Check if empty priority queue contains typed;
	Handle priority changed;
	Get size;
	Check if empty priority queue is empty;
	Check if empty priority queue contains;
	Get iterator;
	Convert empty priority queue to array;
	Add T;
	Remove empty priority queue;
	Check if empty priority queue contains all;
	Add collection;
	Remove collection;
	Retain collection;
	Handle clear;
	Handle clear ignoring indexes;
	Check if empty priority queue equals;
	Hash code;
	Offer T;
	Get poll;
	Get element;
	Get peek;
	Convert empty priority queue to string
