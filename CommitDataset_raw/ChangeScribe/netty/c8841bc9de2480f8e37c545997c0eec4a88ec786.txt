BUG - FEATURE: <type-ID> 

This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. This commit  includes changes to internationalization, properties or configuration files (NOTICE.txt, pom.xml, LICENSE.lz4.txt, ... ). 
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package io.netty.handler.codec.compression:  

1.1. Add a class for lz 4 constants. It allows to:

	Instantiate lz 4 constants

1.2. Add a class for lz 4 frame decoder. It allows to:

	Instantiate lz 4 frame decoder;
	Instantiate lz 4 frame decoder  with LZ 4 factory;
	Instantiate lz 4 frame decoder  with LZ 4 factory, checksum and checksum;
	Decode ctx channel handler context;
	Check if lz 4 frame decoder is closed

1.3. Add a class for lz 4 frame decoder test. It allows to:

	Instantiate lz 4 frame decoder test;
	Handle init channel;
	Handle test unexpected block identifier;
	Handle test invalid compressed length;
	Handle test invalid decompressed length;
	Handle test decompressed and compressed length mismatch;
	Handle test unexpected block type;
	Handle test mismatching checksum;
	Handle test checksum error of last block;
	Compress lz 4 frame decoder test

1.4. Add a class for lz 4 frame encoder. It allows to:

	Instantiate lz 4 frame encoder;
	Instantiate lz 4 frame encoder  with LZ 4 factory, checksum and checksum;
	Get compression level;
	Allocate buffer;
	Encode ctx channel handler context;
	Handle flush buffered data;
	Handle flush;
	Check if lz 4 frame encoder is closed;
	Close lz 4 frame encoder;
	Run;
	Handle operation complete;
	Get ctx;
	Handle handler added;
	Handle handler removed;
	Get backing buffer

1.5. Add a class for lz 4 frame encoder test. It allows to:

	Handle setup;
	Handle init channel;
	Get decompress;
	Handle test allocate direct buffer;
	Handle test allocate heap buffer;
	Handle test allocate buffer;
	Handle test allocate direct buffer exceed max encode size;
	Handle new encoder;
	Handle test allocate on heap buffer overflows output size;
	Handle test flush;
	Handle test allocating around block size;
	Writing lz 4 frame encoder test after closed channel does not NPE;
	Run;
	Handle operation complete

1.6. Add an object creator class for lz 4 frame integration test. It allows to:

	Create encoder;
	Create decoder
