 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package io.netty.buffer:  

1.1. Add a class for fixed composite byte buf test. It allows to:

	Handle new buffer;
	Handle test set boolean;
	Handle test set byte;
	Handle test set bytes with byte buf;
	Handle test set bytes with byte buffer;
	Handle test set bytes with input stream;
	Handle test set bytes with channel;
	Read dsts byte buffer;
	Read dst byte buffer;
	Check if  is open;
	Close;
	Handle test set char;
	Handle test set double;
	Handle test set float;
	Handle test set int;
	Handle test set long;
	Handle test set medium;
	Handle test gathering writes heap;
	Handle test gathering writes direct;
	Handle test gathering writes mixes;
	Handle test gathering writes heap pooled;
	Handle test gathering writes direct pooled;
	Handle test gathering writes mixes pooled;
	Handle test gathering writes;
	Handle test gathering writes partial heap;
	Handle test gathering writes partial direct;
	Handle test gathering writes partial mixes;
	Handle test gathering writes partial heap pooled;
	Handle test gathering writes partial direct pooled;
	Handle test gathering writes partial mixes pooled;
	Handle test gathering writes partial;
	Handle test gathering writes single heap;
	Handle test gathering writes single direct;
	Handle test gathering writes single buf;
	Convert test copying;
	Handle test extract nio buffers;
	Handle test empty array;
	Handle test has memory address with single buffer;
	Handle test has memory address when empty;
	Handle test has no memory address when multiple buffers;
	Handle test has array with single buffer;
	Handle test has array when empty;
	Handle test has no array when multiple buffers
