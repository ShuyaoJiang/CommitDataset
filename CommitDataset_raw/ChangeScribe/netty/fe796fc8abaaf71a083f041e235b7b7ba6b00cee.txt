This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. 
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package io.netty.buffer:  

1.1. Add a class for byte buf util test. It allows to:

	Decode random hex bytes  with even length;
	Decode random hex bytes  with odd length;
	Decode random hex bytes;
	Decode hex dump  with odd length;
	Decode hex dump  with invalid char;
	Check if byte buf util test equals buffer subsections;
	Handle random;
	Not equals buffer subsections;
	Not equals buffer overflow;
	Not equals buffer underflow;
	Write short BE;
	Set short BE;
	Write medium BE;
	Handle test write us ascii;
	Handle test write us ascii swapped;
	Handle test write us ascii wrapped;
	Handle test write us ascii composite;
	Handle test write us ascii composite wrapped;
	Handle test write utf 8;
	Handle test write utf 8 composite;
	Handle test write utf 8 composite wrapped;
	Handle test write utf 8 surrogates;
	Handle test write utf 8 invalid only trailing surrogate;
	Handle test write utf 8 invalid only leading surrogate;
	Handle test write utf 8 invalid surrogates switched;
	Handle test write utf 8 invalid two leading surrogates;
	Handle test write utf 8 invalid two trailing surrogates;
	Handle test write utf 8 invalid end on leading surrogate;
	Handle test write utf 8 invalid end on trailing surrogate;
	Handle test write us ascii string;
	Handle test write utf 8 wrapped;
	Wrapped byte buf;
	Handle test decode us ascii;
	Handle test decode utf 8;
	Handle test decode string;
	Convert test;
	Handle test is text with utf 8;
	Handle test is text without optimization;
	Handle test is text with ascii;
	Handle test is text with invalid index and length;
	Handle test utf 8 bytes;
	Handle test utf 8 bytes with surrogates;
	Handle test utf 8 bytes with non surrogates 3 bytes;
	Handle test utf 8 bytes with non surrogates non ascii;
	Check utf 8 bytes;
	Assert is text;
	Handle test is text multi threaded;
	Run
