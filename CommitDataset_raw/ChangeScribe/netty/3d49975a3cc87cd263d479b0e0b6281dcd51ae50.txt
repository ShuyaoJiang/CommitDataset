BUG - FEATURE: <type-ID> 

This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. This commit  includes changes to internationalization, properties or configuration files (pom.xml). 
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package io.netty.handler.codec.http.websocketx:  

1. Changes to package io.netty.handler.codec.marshalling:  

1.1. Add a class for channel buffer byte input. It allows to:

	Instantiate channel buffer byte input  with buffer;
	Close channel buffer byte input;
	Handle available;
	Read channel buffer byte input;
	Skip channel buffer byte input

1.2. Add a class for channel buffer byte output. It allows to:

	Instantiate channel buffer byte output  with buffer;
	Close channel buffer byte output;
	Handle flush;
	Write channel buffer byte output;
	Get buffer

1.3. Add a class for marshalling decoder. It allows to:

	Instantiate marshalling decoder  with unmarshaller provider;
	Decode ctx channel handler context;
	Extract frame

1.4. Add a class for marshalling encoder. It allows to:

	Instantiate marshalling encoder  with marshaller provider;
	Encode ctx channel handler context

1.5. Add a class for river marshalling decoder test. It allows to:

	Get input;
	Create decoder;
	Process river marshalling decoder test river marshalling decoder test on too big frame

1.6. Add a class for river marshalling encoder test. It allows to:

	Truncate byte buf;
	Create encoder

1.7. Add an object creator class for river thread local marshalling decoder test. It allows to:

	Create provider

1.8. Add a class for serial marshalling decoder test. It allows to:

	Get input;
	Create decoder;
	Process serial marshalling decoder test serial marshalling decoder test on too big frame

1.9. Add a class for serial marshalling encoder test. It allows to:

	Truncate byte buf;
	Create encoder

1.10. Add an object creator class for serial thread local marshalling decoder test. It allows to:

	Create provider
