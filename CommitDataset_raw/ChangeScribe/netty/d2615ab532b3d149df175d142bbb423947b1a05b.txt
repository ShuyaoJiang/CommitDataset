BUG - FEATURE: <type-ID> 

This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. 
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package io.netty.handler.codec.http2:  

1.1. Add a class for stream buffering encoder test. It allows to:

	Handle setup;
	Answer invocation on mock;
	Handle teardown;
	Handle multiple writes to active stream;
	Ensure can create next stream when stream closes;
	Alternating writes  to active and buffered streams;
	Buffering new stream fails  after go away received;
	Receiving go  away fails buffered streams;
	Sending go  away should not fail streams;
	End stream does  not fail buffered stream;
	Handle rst stream closes buffered stream;
	Buffer stream buffering encoder test until active streams are reset;
	Buffer stream buffering encoder test until max streams increased;
	Buffer stream buffering encoder test until settings received;
	Buffer stream buffering encoder test until settings received with no max concurrent stream value;
	Get exhausted streams do not buffer;
	Handle closed buffered stream releases byte buf;
	Close should cancel all buffered streams;
	Handle headers after close should immediately fail;
	Set max concurrent streams;
	Get encoder write headers;
	Write verify write headers;
	Get success answer;
	Handle new promise;
	Get data
