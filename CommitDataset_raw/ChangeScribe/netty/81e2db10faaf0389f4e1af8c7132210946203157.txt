BUG - FEATURE: <type-ID> 

This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. This commit  renames some files.
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package io.netty.buffer:  

1.1. Add a class for abstract byte buf allocator. It allows to:

	Convert abstract byte buf allocator to leak aware buffer;
	Instantiate abstract byte buf allocator;
	Get buffer;
	Io buffer;
	Get heap buffer;
	Handle direct buffer;
	Handle composite buffer;
	Handle composite heap buffer;
	Handle composite direct buffer;
	Validate abstract byte buf allocator;
	Handle new heap buffer;
	Handle new direct buffer;
	Convert abstract byte buf allocator to string;
	Calculate new capacity

1.2. Add an interface declaration  for byte buf allocator. It allows to:

	Get buffer;
	Io buffer;
	Get heap buffer;
	Handle direct buffer;
	Handle composite buffer;
	Handle composite heap buffer;
	Handle composite direct buffer;
	Check if byte buf allocator is direct buffer pooled;
	Calculate new capacity

1.3. Add a class for unpooled direct byte buf. It allows to:

	Instantiate unpooled direct byte buf  with byte buf allocator;
	Instantiate unpooled direct byte buf  with byte buf allocator, initial buffer and initial buffer;
	Allocate direct;
	Handle free direct;
	Set byte buffer;
	Check if unpooled direct byte buf is direct;
	Get capacity;
	Process unpooled direct byte buf unpooled direct byte buf alloc;
	Get order;
	Check if unpooled direct byte buf has array;
	Get array;
	Handle array offset;
	Check if unpooled direct byte buf has memory address;
	Get memory address;
	Get byte;
	Get short;
	Get short LE;
	Get unsigned medium;
	Get unsigned medium LE;
	Get int;
	Get int LE;
	Get unpooled direct byte buf long;
	Get unpooled direct byte buf long LE;
	Get bytes;
	Read bytes;
	Set byte;
	Set short;
	Set short LE;
	Set medium;
	Set medium LE;
	Set int;
	Set int LE;
	Set unpooled direct byte buf long;
	Set long LE;
	Set bytes;
	Handle nio buffer count;
	Handle nio buffers;
	Get copy;
	Handle internal nio buffer;
	Handle nio buffer;
	Handle deallocate;
	Get unwrap

1.4. Add a class for unpooled heap byte buf. It allows to:

	Instantiate unpooled heap byte buf  with byte buf allocator;
	Allocate array;
	Handle free array;
	Set array;
	Process unpooled heap byte buf unpooled heap byte buf alloc;
	Get order;
	Check if unpooled heap byte buf is direct;
	Get capacity;
	Check if unpooled heap byte buf has array;
	Get array;
	Handle array offset;
	Check if unpooled heap byte buf has memory address;
	Get memory address;
	Get bytes;
	Read bytes;
	Set bytes;
	Handle nio buffer count;
	Handle nio buffer;
	Handle nio buffers;
	Handle internal nio buffer;
	Get byte;
	Get short;
	Get short LE;
	Get unsigned medium;
	Get unsigned medium LE;
	Get int;
	Get int LE;
	Get unpooled heap byte buf long;
	Get unpooled heap byte buf long LE;
	Set byte;
	Set short;
	Set short LE;
	Set medium;
	Set medium LE;
	Set int;
	Set int LE;
	Set unpooled heap byte buf long;
	Set long LE;
	Get copy;
	Handle deallocate;
	Get unwrap
