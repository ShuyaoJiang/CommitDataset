This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. 
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package io.netty.example.factorial:  

1. Changes to package io.netty.example.portunification:  

1. Changes to package io.netty.handler.codec.compression:  

1.1. Add a class for j zlib decoder. It allows to:

	Instantiate j zlib decoder;
	Instantiate j zlib decoder  with zlib wrapper;
	Check if j zlib decoder is closed;
	Decode ctx channel handler context

1.2. Add a class for j zlib encoder. It allows to:

	Instantiate j zlib encoder;
	Instantiate j zlib encoder  with zlib wrapper;
	Close j zlib encoder;
	Run;
	Get ctx;
	Check if j zlib encoder is closed;
	Encode ctx channel handler context;
	Handle operation complete;
	Handle handler added

1.3. Add a class for jdk zlib encoder. It allows to:

	Instantiate jdk zlib encoder;
	Instantiate jdk zlib encoder  with zlib wrapper;
	Close jdk zlib encoder;
	Run;
	Get ctx;
	Check if jdk zlib encoder is closed;
	Encode ctx channel handler context;
	Allocate buffer;
	Handle operation complete;
	Deflate out byte buf;
	Handle handler added

1.4. Add an object creator class for zlib codec factory. It allows to:

	Check if zlib codec factory is supporting window size and mem level;
	Handle new zlib encoder;
	Handle new zlib decoder;
	Instantiate zlib codec factory

2. Changes to package io.netty.handler.codec.http:
