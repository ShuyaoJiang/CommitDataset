This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. 
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package io.netty.buffer:  

1.1. Add a class for wrapped unpooled unsafe byte buf test. It allows to:

	Handle init;
	Handle new buffer;
	Handle test internal nio buffer;
	Handle test duplicate read gathering byte channel multiple threads;
	Handle test slice read gathering byte channel multiple threads;
	Handle test duplicate read output stream multiple threads;
	Handle test slice read output stream multiple threads;
	Handle test duplicate bytes in array multiple threads;
	Handle test slice bytes in array multiple threads;
	Handle test nio buffer expose only region;
	Handle test get read only direct dst;
	Handle test get read only heap dst;
	Handle test read bytes;
	Handle test duplicate capacity change;
	Handle test retained duplicate capacity change;
	Handle test little endian with expand;
	Handle test write us ascii char sequence expand;
	Handle test write utf 8 char sequence expand;
	Handle test write iso 88591 char sequence expand;
	Handle test write utf 16 char sequence expand;
	Convert test for each byte desc;
	Convert test for each byte

1.2. Add a class for wrapped unpooled unsafe direct byte buf. It allows to:

	Instantiate wrapped unpooled unsafe direct byte buf  with byte buf allocator;
	Handle free direct

2. Changes to package io.netty.util.internal:
