This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. This commit  renames some files.
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package io.netty.buffer:  

1.1. Add a class for abstract unpooled sliced byte buf. It allows to:

	Instantiate abstract unpooled sliced byte buf  with buffer;
	Handle init length;
	Get length;
	Get unwrap;
	Process abstract unpooled sliced byte buf abstract unpooled sliced byte buf alloc;
	Get order;
	Check if abstract unpooled sliced byte buf is direct;
	Get capacity;
	Check if abstract unpooled sliced byte buf has array;
	Get array;
	Handle array offset;
	Check if abstract unpooled sliced byte buf has memory address;
	Get memory address;
	Get byte;
	Get short;
	Get short LE;
	Get unsigned medium;
	Get unsigned medium LE;
	Get int;
	Get int LE;
	Get abstract unpooled sliced byte buf long;
	Get abstract unpooled sliced byte buf long LE;
	Duplicate abstract unpooled sliced byte buf;
	Get copy;
	Get slice;
	Get bytes;
	Set byte;
	Get char sequence;
	Set short;
	Set short LE;
	Set medium;
	Set medium LE;
	Set int;
	Set int LE;
	Set abstract unpooled sliced byte buf long;
	Set long LE;
	Set bytes;
	Handle nio buffer count;
	Handle nio buffer;
	Handle nio buffers;
	Process abstract unpooled sliced byte buf abstract unpooled sliced byte buf for each byte;
	Process abstract unpooled sliced byte buf abstract unpooled sliced byte buf for each byte desc;
	Get idx;
	Check slice  out of bounds

1.2. Rename type DuplicatedAbstractByteBuf with UnpooledDuplicatedByteBuf

1.3. Add a class for unpooled sliced byte buf. It allows to:

	Instantiate unpooled sliced byte buf  with buffer;
	Get capacity;
	Get unwrap;
	Get byte;
	Get short;
	Get short LE;
	Get unsigned medium;
	Get unsigned medium LE;
	Get int;
	Get int LE;
	Get unpooled sliced byte buf long;
	Get unpooled sliced byte buf long LE;
	Set byte;
	Set short;
	Set short LE;
	Set medium;
	Set medium LE;
	Set int;
	Set int LE;
	Set unpooled sliced byte buf long;
	Set long LE

2. Changes to package io.netty.handler.codec.http.multipart:
