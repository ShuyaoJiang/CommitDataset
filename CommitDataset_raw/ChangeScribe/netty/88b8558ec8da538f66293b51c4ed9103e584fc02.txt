BUG - FEATURE: <type-ID> 

This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. 
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package io.netty.buffer:  

1.1. Add a class for pooled duplicated byte buf. It allows to:

	Handle new object;
	Handle new instance;
	Instantiate pooled duplicated byte buf  with handle;
	Get capacity;
	Handle array offset;
	Get memory address;
	Handle nio buffer;
	Handle nio buffers;
	Get copy;
	Get retained slice;
	Duplicate pooled duplicated byte buf;
	Get retained duplicate;
	Get byte;
	Get short;
	Get short LE;
	Get unsigned medium;
	Get unsigned medium LE;
	Get int;
	Get int LE;
	Get pooled duplicated byte buf long;
	Get pooled duplicated byte buf long LE;
	Get bytes;
	Set byte;
	Set short;
	Set short LE;
	Set medium;
	Set medium LE;
	Set int;
	Set int LE;
	Set pooled duplicated byte buf long;
	Set long LE;
	Set bytes;
	Process pooled duplicated byte buf pooled duplicated byte buf for each byte;
	Process pooled duplicated byte buf pooled duplicated byte buf for each byte desc

1.2. Add a class for pooled sliced byte buf. It allows to:

	Handle new object;
	Handle new instance;
	Handle new instance 0;
	Instantiate pooled sliced byte buf  with handle;
	Get capacity;
	Handle array offset;
	Get memory address;
	Handle nio buffer;
	Handle nio buffers;
	Get copy;
	Get slice;
	Get retained slice;
	Duplicate pooled sliced byte buf;
	Get retained duplicate;
	Get byte;
	Get short;
	Get short LE;
	Get unsigned medium;
	Get unsigned medium LE;
	Get int;
	Get int LE;
	Get pooled sliced byte buf long;
	Get pooled sliced byte buf long LE;
	Get bytes;
	Set byte;
	Set short;
	Set short LE;
	Set medium;
	Set medium LE;
	Set int;
	Set int LE;
	Set pooled sliced byte buf long;
	Set long LE;
	Set bytes;
	Process pooled sliced byte buf pooled sliced byte buf for each byte;
	Process pooled sliced byte buf pooled sliced byte buf for each byte desc;
	Get idx
