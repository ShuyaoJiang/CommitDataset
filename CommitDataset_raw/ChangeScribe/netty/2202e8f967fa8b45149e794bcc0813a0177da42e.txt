BUG - FEATURE: <type-ID> 

This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. 
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package io.netty.example.http2.helloworld.server:  

1.1. Add a class for hello world http 2 handler builder. It allows to:

	Instantiate hello world http 2 handler builder;
	Build hello world http 2 handler builder;
	Build http 2 connection decoder

2. Changes to package io.netty.example.http2.tiles:  

2. Changes to package io.netty.handler.codec.http2:  

2.1. Add a class for abstract http 2 connection handler builder. It allows to:

	Handle initial settings;
	Frame listener;
	Handle graceful shutdown timeout millis;
	Check if abstract http 2 connection handler builder is server;
	Get server;
	Max reserved streams;
	Get connection;
	Get decoder;
	Get encoder;
	Get codec;
	Check if abstract http 2 connection handler builder is validate headers;
	Validate headers;
	Frame logger;
	Handle encoder enforce max concurrent streams;
	Get encoder enforce max concurrent streams;
	Handle header sensitivity detector;
	Get encoder ignore max header list size;
	Handle initial huffman decode capacity;
	Build abstract http 2 connection handler builder;
	Build http 2 connection from connection;
	Build http 2 connection decoder from codec;
	Build http 2 connection decoder;
	Get self;
	Enforce non codec constraints;
	Enforce constraint

2.2. Add a class for http 2 connection handler builder. It allows to:

	Validate headers;
	Handle initial settings;
	Frame listener;
	Handle graceful shutdown timeout millis;
	Get server;
	Get connection;
	Max reserved streams;
	Get codec;
	Frame logger;
	Get encoder enforce max concurrent streams;
	Get encoder ignore max header list size;
	Handle header sensitivity detector;
	Handle initial huffman decode capacity;
	Build http 2 connection handler builder;
	Build http 2 connection decoder

2.3. Add a class for http to http 2 connection handler builder. It allows to:

	Validate headers;
	Handle initial settings;
	Frame listener;
	Handle graceful shutdown timeout millis;
	Get server;
	Get connection;
	Get codec;
	Frame logger;
	Get encoder enforce max concurrent streams;
	Handle header sensitivity detector;
	Handle initial huffman decode capacity;
	Build http to http 2 connection handler builder;
	Build http 2 connection decoder
