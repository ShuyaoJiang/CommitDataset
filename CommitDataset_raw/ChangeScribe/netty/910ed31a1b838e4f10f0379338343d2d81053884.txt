BUG - FEATURE: <type-ID> 

This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. 
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package io.netty.buffer:  

1.1. Add a class for empty byte buf test. It allows to:

	Handle test is writable;
	Handle test write empty byte buf;
	Handle test is readable;
	Handle test array;
	Handle test nio buffer;
	Handle test memory address;
	Handle consistent equals and hash code with abstract bytebuf
