This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. 
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package io.netty.handler.codec.http2:  

1.1. Add a class for read only http 2 headers test. It allows to:

	Not key value pair throws;
	Handle null trailers not allowed;
	Handle null header name not checked;
	Handle null header name validated;
	Handle pseudo header not allowed after non pseudo headers;
	Handle null values are not allowed;
	Handle empty header name allowed;
	Handle test pseudo headers must come first when iterating server;
	Handle test pseudo headers must come first when iterating client;
	Handle test iterator read only client;
	Handle test iterator read only server;
	Handle test iterator read only trailers;
	Handle test iterator entry read only client;
	Handle test iterator entry read only server;
	Handle test iterator entry read only trailers;
	Handle test size;
	Handle test is not empty;
	Handle test is empty;
	Handle test contains name;
	Handle test contains name and value;
	Handle test get;
	Handle test client other value iterator;
	Handle test client psuedo value iterator;
	Handle test server psuedo value iterator;
	Handle test empty value iterator;
	Handle test iterator multiple values;
	Handle test value iterator single value;
	Handle test iterator read only;
	Handle test iterator entry read only;
	Handle new server headers;
	Handle new client headers;
	Handle new trailers;
	Handle other headers

2. Changes to package io.netty.microbench.headers:  

2.1. Add a class for read only http 2 headers benchmark. It allows to:

	Set read only http 2 headers benchmark;
	Get default trailers;
	Read read only http 2 headers benchmark only trailers;
	Get default client headers;
	Read read only http 2 headers benchmark only client headers;
	Get default server headers;
	Read read only http 2 headers benchmark only server headers;
	Iterate http 2 headers;
	Build pairs

3. Changes to package io.netty.util.internal:
