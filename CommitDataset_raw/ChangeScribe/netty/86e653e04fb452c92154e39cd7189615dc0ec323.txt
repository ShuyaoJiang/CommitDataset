BUG - FEATURE: <type-ID> 

This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. 
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package io.netty.channel:  

1.1. Add a class for abstract coalescing buffer queue. It allows to:

	Instantiate abstract coalescing buffer queue  with channel;
	Add  first byte buf;
	Add byte buf;
	Remove  first aggregate promise;
	Remove byte buf allocator;
	Handle readable bytes;
	Check if abstract coalescing buffer queue is empty;
	Release channel outbound invoker;
	Copy  to dest abstract coalescing buffer queue;
	Write ctx channel handler context;
	Compose byte buf allocator;
	Compose byte buf allocator into composite;
	Copy byte buf allocator;
	Compose  first byte buf allocator;
	Remove empty value;
	Get size;
	Release channel future;
	Handle increment readable bytes;
	Handle decrement readable bytes;
	Convert abstract coalescing buffer queue to channel future listener

1.2. Add a class for delegating channel promise notifier. It allows to:

	Instantiate delegating channel promise notifier  with delegate channel promise;
	Handle operation complete;
	Get channel;
	Set success;
	Try success;
	Set failure;
	Add listener;
	Add listeners;
	Remove listener;
	Remove listeners;
	Try failure;
	Set uncancellable;
	Await delegating channel promise notifier;
	Await uninterruptibly;
	Check if delegating channel promise notifier is void;
	Handle unvoid;
	Await time unit;
	Get delegating channel promise notifier now;
	Cancel delegating channel promise notifier;
	Check if delegating channel promise notifier is canceled;
	Check if delegating channel promise notifier is done;
	Get delegating channel promise notifier;
	Get time unit;
	Get sync;
	Get sync uninterruptibly;
	Check if delegating channel promise notifier is success;
	Check if delegating channel promise notifier is cancellable;
	Cause delegating channel promise notifier
