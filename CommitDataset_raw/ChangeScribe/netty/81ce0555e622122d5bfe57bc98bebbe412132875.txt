 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package io.netty.buffer:  

1.1. Add a class for unpooled unsafe direct byte buf. It allows to:

	Instantiate unpooled unsafe direct byte buf  with byte buf allocator;
	Instantiate unpooled unsafe direct byte buf  with byte buf allocator, initial buffer and initial buffer;
	Allocate direct;
	Handle free direct;
	Set byte buffer;
	Check if unpooled unsafe direct byte buf is direct;
	Get capacity;
	Process unpooled unsafe direct byte buf unpooled unsafe direct byte buf alloc;
	Get order;
	Check if unpooled unsafe direct byte buf has array;
	Get array;
	Handle array offset;
	Check if unpooled unsafe direct byte buf has memory address;
	Get memory address;
	Get byte;
	Get short;
	Get short LE;
	Get unsigned medium;
	Get unsigned medium LE;
	Get int;
	Get int LE;
	Get unpooled unsafe direct byte buf long;
	Get unpooled unsafe direct byte buf long LE;
	Get bytes;
	Read bytes;
	Set byte;
	Set short;
	Set short LE;
	Set medium;
	Set medium LE;
	Set int;
	Set int LE;
	Set unpooled unsafe direct byte buf long;
	Set long LE;
	Set bytes;
	Handle nio buffer count;
	Handle nio buffers;
	Get copy;
	Handle internal nio buffer;
	Handle nio buffer;
	Handle deallocate;
	Get unwrap;
	Process unpooled unsafe direct byte buf unpooled unsafe direct byte buf addr;
	Handle new swapped byte buf;
	Set unpooled unsafe direct byte buf;
	Write unpooled unsafe direct byte buf
