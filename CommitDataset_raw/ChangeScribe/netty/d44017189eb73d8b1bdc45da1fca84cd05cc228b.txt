1.1. Add a class for abstract reference counted byte buf test. It allows to:

	Handle test retain overflow;
	Convert test retain overflow;
	Handle test release overflow;
	Handle test release error message;
	Handle test retain resurrect;
	Convert test retain resurrect;
	Handle new reference counted;
	Get byte;
	Get short;
	Get short LE;
	Get unsigned medium;
	Get unsigned medium LE;
	Get int;
	Get int LE;
	Get  long;
	Get  long LE;
	Set byte;
	Set short;
	Set short LE;
	Set medium;
	Set medium LE;
	Set int;
	Set int LE;
	Set  long;
	Set long LE;
	Get capacity;
	Process  alloc;
	Get order;
	Get unwrap;
	Check if  is direct;
	Get bytes;
	Set bytes;
	Get copy;
	Handle nio buffer count;
	Handle nio buffer;
	Handle internal nio buffer;
	Handle nio buffers;
	Check if  has array;
	Get array;
	Handle array offset;
	Check if  has memory address;
	Get memory address;
	Handle deallocate;
	Touch

2. Changes to package io.netty.util:  

2.1. Add a class for abstract reference counted test. It allows to:

	Handle test retain overflow;
	Convert test retain overflow;
	Handle test release overflow;
	Handle test release error message;
	Handle test retain resurrect;
	Convert test retain resurrect;
	Handle test retain from multiple threads throws reference count exception;
	Run;
	Handle test release from multiple threads throws reference count exception;
	Handle new reference counted;
	Handle deallocate;
	Touch
