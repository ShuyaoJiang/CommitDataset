This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. 
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package io.netty.buffer:  

1.1. Add a class for abstract byte buf allocator test. It allows to:

	Handle new allocator;
	Handle new unpooled allocator;
	Check if abstract byte buf allocator test is direct expected;
	Get default max capacity;
	Get default max components;
	Handle test calculate new capacity;
	Handle test unsafe heap buffer and unsafe direct buffer;
	Assert instance  of buffer;
	Handle test used direct memory;
	Handle test used heap memory;
	Get expected used memory;
	Get expected used memory after release

1.2. Add a class for byte buf allocator test. It allows to:

	Get default max capacity;
	Get default max components;
	Handle new allocator;
	Handle test buffer;
	Handle test buffer with capacity;
	Check if byte buf allocator test is direct expected;
	Handle test heap buffer;
	Handle test heap buffer max capacity;
	Handle test direct buffer;
	Handle test direct buffer max capacity;
	Handle test composite buffer;
	Handle test composite buffer with capacity;
	Handle test composite heap buffer;
	Handle test composite heap buffer with capacity;
	Handle test composite direct buffer;
	Handle test composite direct buffer with capacity;
	Assert buffer;
	Assert composite byte buf

1.3. Add an object creator class for unpooled byte buf allocator test. It allows to:

	Handle new allocator;
	Handle new unpooled allocator
