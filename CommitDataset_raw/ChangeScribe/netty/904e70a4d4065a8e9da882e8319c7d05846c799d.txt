BUG - FEATURE: <type-ID> 

This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. This commit  includes changes to internationalization, properties or configuration files (pom.xml). 
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package io.netty.handler.codec.http2:  

1.1. Add a class for weighted fair queue byte distributor test. It allows to:

	Handle setup;
	Write weighted fair queue byte distributor test with non active stream should not dobule add to priority queue;
	Handle bytes unassigned after processing;
	Handle connection error for writer exception;
	Handle min chunk should be allocated per stream;
	Handle empty frame at head is written;
	Get blocked stream no data should spread data to children;
	Get blocked stream with data and not allowed to send should spread data to children;
	Handle stream with zero flow control window and data should write only once;
	Get blocked stream should spread data to children;
	Handle children should not send data until parent blocked;
	Convert parent should water fall data;
	Reprioritize should adjust outbound flow;
	Handle unstreamable parents should feed hungry children;
	Write should prefer highest weight;
	Write should favor priority;
	Handle same priority should distribute based on data;
	Zero distribute should write all zero frames;
	Non zero distribute should write all zero frames  if all eligible data is written;
	Handle bytes distributed with restructure should be correct;
	Handle bytes distributed with addition should be correct;
	Handle bytes distributed should be correct with internal stream close;
	Handle bytes distributed should be correct with leaf stream close;
	Handle active stream dependent on new non active stream gets quantum;
	Handle stream window larger than int does not infinite loop;
	Write weighted fair queue byte distributor test;
	Write verification mode;
	Verify weighted fair queue byte distributor test;
	Verify weighted fair queue byte distributor test never write;
	Verify http 2 stream never write;
	Writes weighted fair queue byte distributor test;
	Writes http 2 stream

2. Changes to package io.netty.microbench.util:  

2. Changes to package io.netty.util.internal:  

2.1. Add an interface declaration  for priority queue. It allows to:

	Typed node;
	Check if priority queue contains typed;
	Handle priority changed;
	Handle clear ignoring indexes

2.2. Add an interface declaration  for priority queue node. It allows to:

	Get priority queue index;
	Handle priority queue index
