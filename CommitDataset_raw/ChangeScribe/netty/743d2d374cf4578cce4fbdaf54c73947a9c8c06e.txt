BUG - FEATURE: <type-ID> 

This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. 
 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package io.netty.microbench.channel:  

1.1. Add a class for embedded channel handler context. It allows to:

	Instantiate embedded channel handler context  with byte buf allocator, channel handler, embedded channel and embedded channel;
	Handle exception;
	Process embedded channel handler context embedded channel handler context attr;
	Check if embedded channel handler context has attr;
	Get channel;
	Get executor;
	Name embedded channel handler context;
	Get handler;
	Check if embedded channel handler context is removed;
	Handle fire channel registered;
	Get fire channel unregistered;
	Get fire channel active;
	Get fire channel inactive;
	Handle fire exception caught;
	Handle fire user event triggered;
	Handle fire channel read;
	Get fire channel read complete;
	Handle fire channel writability changed;
	Get bind;
	Connect remote address;
	Disconnect embedded channel handler context;
	Close embedded channel handler context;
	Deregister embedded channel handler context;
	Disconnect channel promise;
	Deregister channel promise;
	Read embedded channel handler context;
	Write embedded channel handler context;
	Write channel promise;
	Handle flush;
	Get pipeline;
	Process embedded channel handler context embedded channel handler context alloc;
	Handle new promise;
	Handle new progressive promise;
	Handle new succeeded future;
	Handle new failed future;
	Void promise

1.2. Add a class for embedded channel write accumulating handler context. It allows to:

	Instantiate embedded channel write accumulating handler context  with byte buf allocator, channel handler, write cumulator and write cumulator;
	Instantiate embedded channel write accumulating handler context  with byte buf allocator, channel handler, write cumulator, embedded channel and embedded channel;
	Get cumulation;
	Release cumulation;
	Write embedded channel write accumulating handler context;
	Write channel promise;

2. Changes to package io.netty.microbench.handler.ssl:  

2.1. Add a class for abstract ssl handler throughput benchmark. It allows to:

	Handle new buffer;
	Handle setup;
	Tear abstract ssl handler throughput benchmark;
	Allocate buffer;
	Write abstract ssl handler throughput benchmark

2.2. Add a class for ssl handler echo benchmark. It allows to:

	Wrap unwrap
