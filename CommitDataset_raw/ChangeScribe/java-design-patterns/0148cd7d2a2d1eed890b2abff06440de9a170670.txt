 This change set is mainly composed of:  

1. Changes to package com.iluwatar.fluentinterface.fluentiterable:  

1.1. Add an interface declaration  for fluent iterable. It allows to:

	Get filter;
	First fluent iterable;
	Handle last;
	Map function;
	Process fluent iterable fluent iterable as list;
	Copy iterable to list

2. Changes to package com.iluwatar.fluentinterface.fluentiterable.lazy:  

2.1. Add a class for decorating iterator. It allows to:

	Instantiate decorating iterator  with from iterator;
	Check if decorating iterator has next;
	Handle next;
	Compute next

2.2. Add a class for lazy fluent iterable. It allows to:

	Instantiate lazy fluent iterable  with iterable;
	Instantiate lazy fluent iterable;
	Get filter;
	Get iterator;
	Compute next;
	First lazy fluent iterable;
	Handle last;
	Initialize;
	Map function;
	Process lazy fluent iterable lazy fluent iterable as list;
	Process lazy fluent iterable lazy fluent iterable from

3. Changes to package com.iluwatar.fluentinterface.fluentiterable.simple:  

3.1. Add a class for simple fluent iterable. It allows to:

	Instantiate simple fluent iterable  with iterable;
	Get filter;
	First simple fluent iterable;
	Handle last;
	Map function;
	Process simple fluent iterable simple fluent iterable as list;
	Process simple fluent iterable simple fluent iterable from;
	Process simple fluent iterable simple fluent iterable from copy of;
	Get iterator;
