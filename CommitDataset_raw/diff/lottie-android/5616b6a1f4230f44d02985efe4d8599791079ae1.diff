[+++ b/README.md, +## Performance, +1. If the composition has no masks or mattes then the performance and memory overhead should be quite good. No bitmaps are created and most operations are simple canvas draw operations., +2. If the composition has mattes, 2-3 bitmaps will be created at the composition size. The bitmaps are created automatically by lottie when the animation view is added to the window and recycled when it is removed from the window. For this reason, it is not recommended to use animations with masks or mattes in a RecyclerView because it will cause significant bitmap churn, +3. If you are using your animation in a list, it is recommended to use a CacheStrategy in LottieAnimationView.setAnimation(String, CacheStrategy) so the animations doesn't have to be deserialized every time., +, +## Try it out, +Clone this repository and run the LottieSample module to see a bunch of sample animations. The JSON files for them are located in [/assets](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/tree/master/LottieSample/src/main/assets)., +, +The sample app can also load json files at a given url or locally on your device (like Downloads or on your sdcard)., +]
