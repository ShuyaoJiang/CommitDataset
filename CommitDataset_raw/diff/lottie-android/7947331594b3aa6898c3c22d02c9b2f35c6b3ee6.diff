[+++ b/README.md, +2. [Facebook Keyframes](https://github.com/facebookincubator/Keyframes). Keyframes is a wonderful new library from Facebook that they built for reactions. However, it only supports a small subset of the features suppoted by Lottie such as masks, mattes, trim paths, dash patterns, and more., +Lottie animations are rendered by `LottieAnimationView`. `LottieAnimationView` animations are defined by a `LottieComposition`., +You can load a composition directly with `LottieComposition.fromFile(...)` which will look in `src/main/assets` or `LottieComposition.fromJson(...)` if you have a raw JSONObject (useful for loading animations from the newtork)., +However, the simplest way to use it is with an xml attribute or to let LottieAnimationView load the composition:, +, +```, +<com.airbnb.lottie.LottieAnimationView, +        android:id="@+id/animation_view", +        android:layout_width="wrap_content", +        android:layout_height="wrap_content", +        app:lottie_fileName="hello-world.json", +        app:lottie_loop="true"/>, +```, +, +Or you can load it programatically:, +```, +LottieAnimationView animationView = findViewById(R.id.animation_view);, +animationView.setAnimation("hello-world.json");, +animationView.loop(true);, +animationView.playAnimation();, +, +```]
