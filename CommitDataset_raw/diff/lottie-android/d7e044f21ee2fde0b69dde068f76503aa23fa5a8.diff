[+++ b/CHANGELOG.md, +# 3.0.0, +* Added support for dynamic properties on rectangles, gradient colors, and gradient fill opacity., +* Added support for inverted and intersect masks., +* Improved support for multiple masks per layer., +* Added support for optimized bodymovin json with static transforms removed (v5.5.0+)., +* Added support for optimized bodymovin json that will omit duplicated vertex out points to reduce json file size (v5.5.0+)., +* Added support for centered, multiline text, and emojis., +* Added support for masked text., +* Added support for skew and skew angle in transforms., +* Added support for markers. You can now call `setMinFrame`, `setMaxFrame` and `setMinAndMaxFrame` with a marker name., +* Added support for multiple trim paths to be applied on a shape., +* Removed **all** memory allocations during playback including autoboxing., +* Only redraw the animation when a value changed. This will have a major impact on animations that are static for part of their playback., +* Optimized keyframes to recalculate values less frequently, +* Optimized static identity transforms so their matrix doesn't get recalculated on every frame., +* Ensure that the last frame is played when setMaxFrame is called., +* Prevent strokes from drawing when the scale is 0., +* Fixed an IndexOutOfBoundsException., +* Pause Lottie in onVisibilityChanged., +* Properly limited the LRU cache an enable its maximum size to be configured., +* Prevented the cache from returning null values after a key was cleared., +* Properly closed JsonReader in all cases., +* Fixed text alignment for scaled text when drawn using fonts., +* Use FutureTask rather than polling for composition parsing to complete., +* [Sample App] Fixed Lottiefiles integration., +++ b/CHANGELOG.md, +# 3.0.0, +* Added support for dynamic properties on rectangles, gradient colors, and gradient fill opacity., +* Added support for inverted and intersect masks., +* Improved support for multiple masks per layer., +* Added support for optimized bodymovin json with static transforms removed (v5.5.0+)., +* Added support for optimized bodymovin json that will omit duplicated vertex out points to reduce json file size (v5.5.0+)., +* Added support for centered, multiline text, and emojis., +* Added support for masked text., +* Added support for skew and skew angle in transforms., +* Added support for markers.
