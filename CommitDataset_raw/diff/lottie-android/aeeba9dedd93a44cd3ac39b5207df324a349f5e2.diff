[+++ b/README.md, +# Lottie for Android (and [iOS](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios)), +, +Lottie is a mobile library for Andorid and iOS that parses [Adobe After Effects](http://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html) animations exported as json with [bodymovin](https://github.com/bodymovin/bodymovin) and renders them natively on mobile!, +, +For the first time, designers can create **and ship** beautiful animations without an enginineer painstakingly recreating it be hand., +* [Painstaking example 1](http://jeremie-martinez.com//2016/09/15/train-animations/), +* [Painstaking example 2](https://blog.twitter.com/2015/hearts-on-twitter), +, +They say a picture is worth 1,000 words so here are 6,000, +, +, +, +# Alternatives, +1. Build animations by hand. Building animations by hand is a huge time commitment for design and engingeering across Android and iOS. It's often hard or even impossible to justify spending so much time to get an animation right., +2. Gifs. Gifs are more than double the size of a bodymovin JSON and are rendered at a fixed size that can't be scaled up to match large and high density screens., +3. Png sequences. Png sequences are even worse than gifs in that their file sizes are often 30-50x the size of the bodymovin json and also can't be scaled up., +, +# Using Lottie, +Using Lottie is as simple as adding an image to an ImageView. `LottieAnimationView` can consume JSON stored in one of two ways:, +, +1. By specifying the JSON filename in the /assets directory of your app., +2. By passing in the raw JSONObject. With this, you have the option of hosting your animations on your server and downloading them through a network request! This opens up the possibility of a/b testing animations or providing animations that are very specific to the user such as an animated Eifel Tower when an Airbnb traveler books a listing in Paris., +, +# Contributing, +Contributers are more than welcome. Just upload a PR with a description of your changes., +Lottie uses [Facebook screenshot tests for Android](https://github.com/facebook/screenshot-tests-for-android) to identify pixel level changes/breakages. Please run `./gradlew --daemon recordMode screenshotTests` before uploading a PR to ensure that nothing has broken., +, +If you would like to add more JSON files and screenshot tests, feel free to do so and add the test to `LottieTest`.]
