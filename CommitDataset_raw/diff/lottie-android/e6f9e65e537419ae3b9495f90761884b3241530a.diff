[+++ b/README.md, +Lottie supports Jellybean (API 16) and above., +2. If the composition has mattes, 2-3 bitmaps will be created at the composition size. The bitmaps are created automatically by lottie when the animation view is added to the window and recycled when it is removed from the window. For this reason, it is not recommended to use animations with masks or mattes in a RecyclerView because it will cause significant bitmap churn., +3. In addition to memory churn, additional bitmap.eraseColor() and canvas.drawBitmap() calls are necessary which will slow down the performance of the animation. For small animations, the performance hit shouldn't be large enough to be obvious when actually used., +4. If you are using your animation in a list, it is recommended to use a CacheStrategy in LottieAnimationView.setAnimation(String, CacheStrategy) so the animations doesn't have to be deserialized every time.]
