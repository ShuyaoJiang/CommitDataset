[+++ b/CHANGELOG.md, +# 2.9.0, +### Features and Improvements, +* **Significant** mask and matte performance improvements by only calling saveLayer() on the intersection bounds of the content and mask/matte., +* Removed **all** memory allocations during playback including autoboxing., +* Added support for centered text., +* Added support for hidden layers and properties (the eye button in After Effects)., +* Only redraw the animation when a value changed. This will have a major impact on animations that are static for part of their playback., +* Replaced `enableHardwareAcceleration` with a new `setRenderMode` API because it has a third (`Automatic`) option. Refer to the docs for more info., +* Added an XML attr for animation speed (lottie_speed)., +* Removed the recycleBitmaps() API because it is not neccesary anymore., +* Prevented `invalidateSelf()` from being called and recalculating bounds many times per frame., +* Optimize keyframes to recalculate values less frequently, +* Optimize static identity transforms so their matrix doesn't get recalculated on every frame., +* Allow text to be masked., +### Bugs Fixed, +* Prevented minFrame from being larger than maxFrame., +* Return the correct (previous) bitmap when updating the BitmapAssetManager., +* Properly use the in-memory cache for network animations., +* Prevented color animations from interpolating before/after the start/end colors even if their interpolator goes <0 or >1., +* Annotate `fetchBitmap()` as `@Nullable`, +* Fixed a bug in the local file cache that would save it with the wrong extensions., +* Fixed a crash when an animation was missing gradient fill type., +* Prevent shapes that have different numbers of control points in different keyframes from crashing., +, +++ b/CHANGELOG.md, +# 2.9.0, +### Features and Improvements, +* **Significant** mask and matte performance improvements by only calling saveLayer() on the intersection bounds of the content and mask/matte., +* Removed **all** memory allocations during playback including autoboxing., +* Added support for centered text., +* Added support for hidden layers and properties (the eye button in After Effects)., +* Only redraw the animation when a value changed.
