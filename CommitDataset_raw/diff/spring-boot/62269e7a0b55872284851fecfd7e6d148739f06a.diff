[+++ b/CONTRIBUTING.adoc, +NOTE: As for the standard build, you may need to increase the amount of memory available, +to Maven by setting a `MAVEN_OPTS` environment variable with the value, +`-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=128m`. We generate more artifacts when running the full build, +(such as Javadoc jars), so you may find the process a little slower than the standard build.]
