[+++ b/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/EnableAutoConfiguration.java, + * When using {@link SpringBootApplication}, the auto-configuration of the context is, + * automatically enabled and adding this annotation has therefore no additional effect., + * <p>, + * The package of the class that is annotated with {@code @EnableAutoConfiguration},, + * usually via {@code @SpringBootApplication}, has specific significance and is often used, + * as a 'default'. For example, it will be used when scanning for {@code @Entity} classes., + * It is generally recommended that you place {@code @EnableAutoConfiguration} (if you're, + * not using {@code @SpringBootApplication}) in a root package so that all sub-packages, + * and classes can be searched., + * @see SpringBootApplication]
