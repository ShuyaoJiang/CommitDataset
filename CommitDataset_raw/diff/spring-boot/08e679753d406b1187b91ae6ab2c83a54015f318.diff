[+++ b/CONTRIBUTING.md, +Before we accept a non-trivial patch or pull request we will need you to sign the, +[contributor's agreement](https://support.springsource.com/spring_committer_signup)., +Signing the contributor's agreement does not grant anyone commit rights to the main repository, but it does mean that we, +can accept your contributions, and you will get an author credit if we do.  Active contributors might be asked to join, +the core team, and given the ability to merge pull requests., +, +## Code Conventions and Housekeeping, +, +None of these is essential for a pull request, but they will all help.  They can also be added after the original pull, +request but before a merge., +, +* Use the Spring Framework code format conventions. Import `eclipse-code-formatter.xml` from the root of the project, +  if you are using Eclipse. If using IntelliJ, copy `spring-intellij-code-style.xml` to `~/.IntelliJIdea*/config/codestyles`, +  and select spring-intellij-code-style from Settings -> Code Styles., +* Make sure all new .java files to have a simple Javadoc class comment with at least an @author tag identifying you, and, +  preferably at least a paragraph on what the class is for., +* Add the ASF license header comment to all new .java files (copy from existing files in the project), +* Add yourself as an @author to the .java files that you modify substantially (moew than cosmetic changes)., +* Add some Javadocs and, if you change the namespace, some XSD doc elements., +* A few unit tests would help a lot as well - someone has to do it., +* If no-one else is using your branch, please rebase it against the current master (or other target branch in the main project)., +]
