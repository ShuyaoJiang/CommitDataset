[+++ b/spring-boot-cli/README.md, +## Installing the CLI, +, +You need [Java SDK v1.6](http://www.java.com) or higher to run the command line tool, +(there are even some issues with the `1.7.0_25` build of openjdk, so stick to earlier, +builds or use `1.6` for preference). You should check your current Java installation, +before you begin:, +, +	$ java -version, +, +### Manual installation, +You can download the Spring CLI distribution from the Spring software repository:, +, +* [spring-boot-cli-0.5.0.M4-bin.zip](http://repo.spring.io/milestone/org/springframework/boot/spring-boot-cli/0.5.0.M4/spring-boot-cli-0.5.0.M4-bin.zip), +* [spring-boot-cli-0.5.0.M4-bin.tar.gz](http://repo.spring.io/milestone/org/springframework/boot/spring-boot-cli/0.5.0.M4/spring-boot-cli-0.5.0.M4-bin.tar.gz), +, +Cutting edge [snapshot distributions](http://repo.spring.io/snapshot/org/springframework/boot/spring-boot-cli/), +are also available., +, +Once downloaded, follow the, +[INSTALL](spring-boot-cli/src/main/content/INSTALL.txt) instructions, +from the unpacked archive. In summary: there is a `spring` script, +(`spring.bat` for Windows) in a `bin/` directory in the `.zip` file,, +or alternatively you can use `java -jar` with the `.jar` file (the, +script helps you to be sure that the classpath is set correctly)., +, +### Installation with GVM, +, +GVM (the Groovy Environment Manager) can be used for managing multiple, +versions of verious Groovy and Java binary packages, including Groovy, +itself and the Spring Boot CLI. Get `gvm` from, +[the gvm home page](http://gvmtool.net) and install Spring Boot with, +, +    $ gvm install springboot, +    $ spring --version, +    Spring Boot v0.5.0.M4, +    , +> **Note:** If you are developing features for the CLI and want easy access to the version you just built, follow these extra instructions., +, +    $ gvm install springboot dev /path/to/spring-boot/spring-boot-cli/target/spring-boot-cli-0.5.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT-bin/spring-0.5.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/, +   	$ gvm use springboot dev, +   	$ spring --version, +    Spring CLI v0.5.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT, +   	, +This will install a local instance of `spring` called the `dev` instance inside your gvm repository. It points at your target build location, so every time you rebuild Spring Boot, `spring` will be up-to-date., +, +You can see it by doing this:, +, +    $ gvm ls springboot, +, +```, +================================================================================, +Available Springboot Versions, +================================================================================, + > + dev                                                                           , +   * 0.5.0.M4                                                                      , +, +================================================================================, ++ - local version, +* - installed, +> - currently in use, +================================================================================, +```, +, +### OSX Homebrew installation, +If you are on a Mac and using [homebrew](http://brew.sh/), all you need to do to install, +the Spring Boot CLI is:, +, +```, +$ brew install http://repo.spring.io/install/spring-boot-cli.rb, +```, +, +Homebrew will install `spring` to `/usr/local/bin`. Now you can jump right to a, +[quick start example](#quick-start-script-example)., +, +> **Note:** If you don't see the formula, you're installation of brew might be, +> out-of-date. Just execute `brew update` and try again., +, +### Quick start script example, +Here's a really simple web application. Create a file called `app.groovy`:, +, +```groovy, +@Controller, +class ThisWillActuallyRun {, +, +	@RequestMapping("/"), +	@ResponseBody, +	String home() {, +		return "Hello World!", +	}, +, +}, +```, +, +Then run it from a shell:, +, +```, +$ spring run app.groovy, +```, +]
