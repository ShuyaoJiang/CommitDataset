[+++ b/spring-boot-docs/src/main/asciidoc/production-ready-features.adoc, +, +Spring Boot provides a couple of implementations of a marker interface, +called `Exporter` which can be used to copy metric readings from the, +in-memory buffers to a place where they can be analyzed and, +displayed. Indeed, if you provide a `@Bean` that implements the, +`MetricWriter` interface (or `GaugeWriter` for simple use cases) and, +mark it `@ExportMetricWriter`, then it will automatically be hooked up, +to an `Exporter` and fed metric updates every 5 seconds (configured, +via `spring.metrics.export.delay-millis`). In addition, any, +`MetricReader` that you define and mark as `@ExportMetricReader` will, +have its values exported by the default exporter.]
