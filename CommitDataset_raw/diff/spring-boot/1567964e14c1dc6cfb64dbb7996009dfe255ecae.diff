[+++ b/spring-boot-docs/src/main/asciidoc/cloud-deployment.adoc, +[[cloud-deployment-openshift]], +=== Openshift, +https://www.openshift.com/[Openshift] is the RedHat public (and enterprise) PaaS solution., +Like Heroku, it works by running scripts triggered by git commits, so you can script, +the launching of a Spring Boot app in pretty much any way you like as long as the, +Java runtime is available (which is a standard feature you can ask from at Openshift)., +To do this you can use the https://www.openshift.com/developers/do-it-yourself[DIY Cartridge], +and hooks in your repository under `.openshift/action_scripts`:, +, +The basic model is to:, +, +1. Ensure Java and your build tool are installed remotely, e.g. using , +a `pre_build` hook (Java and Maven are installed by default, Gradle is not), +, +2. Use a `build` hook to build your jar (using Maven or Gradle), e.g., +, +----, +#!/bin/bash, +cd $OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR, +mvn package -s .openshift/settings.xml -DskipTests=true, +----, +, +3. Add a `start` hook that calls `java -jar ...`, +, +----, +#!/bin/bash, +cd $OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR, +nohup java -jar target/*.jar --server.port=${OPENSHIFT_DIY_PORT} --server.address=${OPENSHIFT_DIY_IP} &, +----, +, +4. Use a `stop` hook (since the start is supposed to return cleanly), e.g., +, +----, +#!/bin/bash, +source $OPENSHIFT_CARTRIDGE_SDK_BASH, +PID=$(ps -ef | grep java.*\.jar | grep -v grep | awk '{ print $2 }'), +if [ -z "$PID" ], +then, +    client_result "Application is already stopped", +else, +    kill $PID, +fi, +----, +, +5. Embed service bindings from environment variables provided by the platform, +in your `application.properties`, e.g., +, +----, +spring.datasource.url: jdbc:mysql://${OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_HOST}:${OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_PORT}/${OPENSHIFT_APP_NAME}, +spring.datasource.username: ${OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_USERNAME}, +spring.datasource.password: ${OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_PASSWORD}, +----, +, +There's a blog on https://www.openshift.com/blogs/run-gradle-builds-on-openshift[running Gradle , +in Openshift] on their website that will get you started with a gradle build to run, +the app. A http://issues.gradle.org/browse/GRADLE-2871[bug in Gradle] currently prevents you, +from using Gradle newer than 1.6.]
