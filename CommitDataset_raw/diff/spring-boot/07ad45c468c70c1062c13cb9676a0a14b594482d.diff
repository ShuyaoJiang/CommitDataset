You get a one-stop-shop for all the Spring and related technology, +that you need without having to hunt through sample code and copy paste loads of, +dependency descriptors. For example, if you want to get started using Spring and, +JPA for database access just include the `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` dependency in, +your project, and you are good to go., +For complete details see the, +http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#using-boot-starter-poms[reference documentation], +, +== Community Contributions, +If you create a starter for a technology that is not already in the standard list we can, +list it here.
