[+++ b/spring-boot-docs/src/main/asciidoc/spring-boot-features.adoc, +transparently, without any interference to the invoker.  Spring Boot auto-configures the, +cache infrastructure as long as the caching support is enabled via the `@EnableCaching`, +cache that you use in the application. Some offers a way to build default caches that you, +need to specify with the `spring.cache.cache-names` property., +In the example above, an auto-configured `ConcurrentMapCacheManager` is expected. If that, +is not the case (either you provided your own config or a different cache provider was, +auto-configured), the customizer won't be invoked at all. You can have as many customizers, +as you want and you can also order them as usual using `@Order` or `Ordered`.]
