[+++ b/README.md, +# Spring Bootstrap, +, +Spring Bootstrap is "Spring for Snowboarders".  If you are kewl, or, +just impatient, and you want to use Spring, then this is the place to, +be. Spring Bootstrap is a toolkit and runtime platform that will get, +you up and running with Spring-powered, production-grade applications, +and services with absolute minimum fuss. It takes an opinionated view, +of the Spring family so that new and existing users can quickly get to, +the bits they need. Assumes no knowledge of the Java development, +ecosystem. Absolutely no code generation and no XML (unless you really, +want it)., +, +The goals are:, +, +* Radically faster and widely accessible getting started experience, +  for Spring development, +* Be opinionated out of the box, but get out of the way quickly as, +  requirements start to diverge from the defaults, +* Provide a range of non-functional features that are common to large, +  classes of projects (e.g. embedded servers, security, metrics,, +  health checks, externalized configuration), +* First class support for REST-ful services, modern web applications,, +  batch jobs, and enterprise integration, +* Applications that adapt their behaviour or configuration to their, +  environment, +* Optionally use Groovy features like DSLs and AST transformations to, +  accelerate the implementation of basic business requirements, +  , +## Installing, +You need to build from source for now, but when it's done instructions will look like this:, +, +1) Get Java.  Download and install the Java SDK from www.java.com, +, +2) Get Spring, +, +     $ curl -s try.spring.io | bash, +     , +   or use the Windows installer, +, +3) Get to Work!, +, +    $ cat > app.groovy, +	@Controller, +	class ThisWillActuallyRun {, +		@RequestMapping("/"), +		@ResponseBody, +		String home() {, +			return "Hello World!", +		}, +	}, +    $ spring run app.groovy, +    $ curl localhost:8080, +    Hello World!, +, +, +## What? It's Groovy then? or like Grails? or another Roo?, +, +There is a command line tool that uses Groovy underneath so that we, +can present simple snippets that can just run just like the slimline, +`app.groovy` example above.  Groovy makes this really easy., +, +If you don't want to use the command line tool, or you would rather, +work using Java and an IDE you can. Just add a `main()` method that, +calls `SpringApplication` and add `@EnableAutoConfiguration`:, +, +, +	import org.springframework.stereotype.*;, +	import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;, +	import org.springframework.bootstrap.context.annotation.*;, +, +	@Controller, +	@EnableAutoConfiguration, +	public class SampleController {, +, +			@RequestMapping("/"), +			@ResponseBody, +			String home() {, +				return "Hello World!", +			}, +, +            public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {, +			SpringApplication.run(SampleController.class, args);, +		}, +, +    }, +, +## Spring Bootstrap Themes, +, +There are a number of themes in Bootstrap. Here are the important, +ones:, +, +### The Spring CLI, +, +The 'spring' command line application compiles and runs Groovy source,, +making it super easy to write the absolute minimum of code to get an, +application running. Spring CLI can also watch files, automatically, +recompiling and restarting when they change., +, +### Bootstrap Core]
