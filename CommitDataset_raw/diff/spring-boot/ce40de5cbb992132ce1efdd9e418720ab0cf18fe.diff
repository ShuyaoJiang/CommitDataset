It answers the basic "`what?`", "`how?`" and "`why?`" questions. It includes, +an introduction to Spring Boot, along with installation instructions., +We then walk you through building your first Spring Boot application, discussing some core principles as, +Applications that you can run. We take an opinionated view of the Spring, +platform and third-party libraries, so that you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring, +You can use Spring Boot to create Java applications that can be started by using `java -jar`, +* Be opinionated out of the box but get out of the way quickly as requirements start to, +(such as embedded servers, security, metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration)., +3.2+, and Gradle 4., +=== Servlet Containers, +line tool. Either way, you need http://www.java.com[Java SDK v1.8] or higher. Before you, +begin, you should check your current Java installation by using the following command:, +If you are new to Java development or if you want to experiment with Spring Boot,, +you might want to try the <<getting-started-installing-the-cli, Spring Boot CLI>> (Command Line Interface) first,, +=== Installation Instructions for the Java Developer, +You can use Spring Boot in the same way as any standard Java library. To do so, include the, +any special tools integration, so you can use any IDE or text editor. Also, there is, +nothing special about a Spring Boot application, so you can run and debug a Spring Boot application as you would, +Although you _could_ copy Spring Boot jars, we generally recommend that you use a, +==== Maven Installation, +Spring Boot is compatible with Apache Maven 3.2 or above. If you do not already have Maven, +installed, you can follow the instructions at http://maven.apache.org., +TIP: On many operating systems, Maven can be installed with a package manager. If you, +use OSX Homebrew, try `brew install maven`. Ubuntu users can run, +from an elevated (administrator) prompt., +Spring Boot dependencies use the `org.springframework.boot` `groupId`. Typically, your, +Maven POM file inherits from the `spring-boot-starter-parent` project and declares, +The following listing shows a typical `pom.xml` file:, +parent POM, or you might not like our default settings. In those cases, see, +==== Gradle Installation, +Spring Boot is compatible with Gradle 4. If you do not already have Gradle installed, you, +Spring Boot dependencies can be declared by using the `org.springframework.boot` `group`., +Typically, your project declares dependencies to one or more, +project. It is a small script and library that you commit alongside your code to bootstrap, +The Spring Boot CLI (Command Line Interface) is a command line tool that you can use to quickly, +prototype with Spring. It lets you run http://groovy-lang.org/[Groovy] scripts,, +which means that you have a familiar Java-like syntax without so much boilerplate code., +You do not need to use the CLI to work with Spring Boot, but it is definitely the quickest, +==== Manual Installation, +instructions from the unpacked archive. In summary, there is a `spring` script, +(`spring.bat` for Windows) in a `bin/` directory in the `.zip` file. Alternatively, you, +Get SDKMAN! from http://sdkman.io and install Spring Boot by using the following commands:, +If you are developing features for the CLI and want easy access to the version you, +built, use the following commands:, +The preceding instructions install a local instance of `spring` called the `dev` instance., +Boot, `spring` is up-to-date., +You can see it by running the following command:, +==== OSX Homebrew Installation, +If you are on a Mac and use http://brew.sh/[Homebrew], you can install, +the Spring Boot CLI by using the following commands:, +Homebrew installs `spring` to `/usr/local/bin`., +NOTE: If you do not see the formula, your installation of brew might be out-of-date., +In that case, run `brew update` and try again., +==== MacPorts Installation, +If you are on a Mac and use http://www.macports.org/[MacPorts], you can, +install the Spring Boot CLI by using the following command:, +==== Command-line Completion, +The Spring Boot CLI includes scripts that provide command completion for, +the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29[BASH] and, +`spring`) in any shell or put it in your personal or system-wide bash completion, +initialization. On a Debian system, the system-wide scripts are in `/shell-completion/bash`, +and all scripts in that directory are executed when a new shell starts. For example, to run the script, +manually if you have installed using SDKMAN!, use the following commands:, +NOTE: If you install the Spring Boot CLI by using Homebrew or MacPorts, the command-line, +==== Quick-start Spring CLI Example, +You can use the following web application to test your installation. To start, create, +a file called `app.groovy`, as follows:, +Then run it from a shell, as follows:, +NOTE: The first run of your application is slow, as dependencies are, +downloaded. Subsequent runs are much quicker., +Open http://localhost:8080 in your favorite web browser. You should see the following, +=== Upgrading from an Earlier Version of Spring Boot, +== Developing Your First Spring Boot Application, +This section describes how to develop a simple "`Hello World!`" web application that highlights some, +of Spring Boot's key features. We use Maven to build this project, since most IDEs, +The http://spring.io[spring.io] web site contains many "`Getting Started`" http://spring.io/guides[guides], +that use Spring Boot.

Check the https://github.com/spring-io/initializr[Spring Initializr documentation] for, +more details., +Before we begin, open a terminal and run the following commands to ensure that you have valid versions of Java and Maven, +installed:, +is used to build your project. Open your favorite text editor and add the following:, +The preceding listing should give you a working build. You can test it by running `mvn package` (for, +now, you can ignore the "`jar will be empty - no content was marked for inclusion!`" warning)., +NOTE: At this point, you could import the project into an IDE (most modern Java IDEs, +include built-in support for Maven). For simplicity, we continue to use a plain, +=== Adding Classpath Dependencies, +Spring Boot provides a number of "`Starters`" that let you add jars to your, +Other "`Starters`" provide dependencies that you are likely to need when, +add a `spring-boot-starter-web` dependency. Before that, we can look at what we, +currently have by running the following command:, +dependencies by itself. To add the necessary dependencies, edit your `pom.xml` and add the `spring-boot-starter-web` dependency, +immediately below the `parent` section:, +If you run `mvn dependency:tree` again, you see that there are now a number of, +=== Writing the Code, +To finish our application, we need to create a single Java file.
