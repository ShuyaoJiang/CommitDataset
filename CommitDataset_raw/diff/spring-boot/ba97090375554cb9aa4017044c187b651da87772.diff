This, +limitation doesn't apply to Jetty and Undertow., +, +Using configuration like the example above means the application will no longer support, +plain HTTP connector at port 8080. Spring Boot doesn't support the configuration of both, +an HTTP connector and an HTTPS connector via `application.properties`. If you want to, +have both then you'll need to configure one of them programmatically. It's recommended, +to use `application.properties` to configure HTTPS as the HTTP connector is the easier of, +the two to configure programmatically.
