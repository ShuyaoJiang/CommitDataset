[+++ b/spring-boot-docs/src/main/asciidoc/production-ready-features.adoc, +=== Accessing sensitive endpoints, +By default all sensitive HTTP endpoints are secured such that only users that have an, +`ACTUATOR` role may access them. Security is enforced using the standard, +`HttpServletRequest.isUserInRole` method., +, +TIP: Use the `management.security.roles` property if you want something different to, +`ACTUATOR`., +, +If you are deploying applications behind a firewall, you may prefer that all your actuator, +endpoints can be accessed without requiring authentication. You can do this by changing, +the `management.security.enabled` property:, +, +.application.properties, +[source,properties,indent=0], +----, +	management.security.enabled=false, +----, +, +NOTE: By default, actuator endpoints are exposed on the same port that serves regular, +HTTP traffic. Take care not to accidentally expose sensitive information if you change, +the `management.security.enabled` property., +, +If you're deploying applications publicly, you may want to add '`Spring Security`' to, +handle user authentication. When '`Spring Security`' is added, by default '`basic`', +authentication will be used with the username `user` and a generated password (which is, +printed on the console when the application starts).]
