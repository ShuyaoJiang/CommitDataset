[+++ b/spring-boot-docs/src/main/asciidoc/spring-boot-features.adoc, +The `@ConditionalOnBean` and `@ConditionalOnMissingBean` annotations allow a bean, +Conditions are evaluated after all configuration classes have been processed. This clearly, +means that you can't use it to make a whole configuration class conditional on the presence, +(or absence) of another bean. You can, however, use it when you have to share that, +condition with all the beans of that configuration class., +, +[NOTE], +====, +You also need to be very careful about ordering as the condition will be evaluated based on, +the bean definitions that have been processed so far. Auto-configured `@Configuration` is, +always parsed last (after any user defined beans) so it is recommended to restrict the use, +of that condition on auto-configuration classes only. However, if you are sure that the bean, +targeted at the condition won't be created by auto-configuration, then you could use it on a, +normal configuration class with appropriate ordering., +====]
