The provider needs to be configured with an `issuer-uri` which is the, +URI that the it asserts as its Issuer Identifier. For example, if the, +`issuer-uri` provided is "https://example.com", then an `OpenID Provider Configuration Request`, +will be made to "https://example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration". The result is expected, +to be an `OpenID Provider Configuration Response`.
