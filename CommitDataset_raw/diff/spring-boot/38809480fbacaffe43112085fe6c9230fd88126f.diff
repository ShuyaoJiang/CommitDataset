You get a one-stop-shop for all the, +Spring and related technology that you need without having to hunt, +through sample code and copy paste loads of dependency, +descriptors. For example, if you want to get started using Spring and, +JPA for database access just include the, +`spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` dependency in your project, and you are, +good to go.  The starters contain a lot of the dependencies that you, +need to get a project up and running quickly and with a consistent,, +supported set of managed transitive dependencies., +, +## Building a Spring Boot Project with Maven, +, +The quickest way to get started with a new project is to use the, +spring-boot-starter-parent, e.g., +, +```xml, +	<!-- Inherit defaults from Spring Boot -->, +	<parent>, +		<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>, +		<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>, +		<version>1.0.0.RC3</version>, +	</parent>, +```, +, +The parent pom adds two main fetaures to your project:, +, +* dependency management configuration, so you don't have to specify, +  versions or excludes with your own dependencies, as long as they are, +  part of the Spring Boot stack, +  , +* plugin configuration, so you don't have to configure some common, +  settings in the main Maven plugins used to get a project off the, +  ground (e.g. the, +  [Spring Boot Maven plugin](../spring-boot-tools/spring-boot-maven-plugin/README.md)), +  , +As an example, if you want to build a simple RESTful web service with, +embedded Tomcat, you only need one dependency:, +, +```xml, +	<dependencies>, +		<dependency>, +			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>, +			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>, +		</dependency>, +	</dependencies>, +```, +, +And if you want to use the Spring Boot plugin to package the project, +as an executable JAR (or run it from source code), you only need to, +add the plugin (not configure it, unless you want to change the, +settings in the parent):, +, +```xml, +	<build>, +		<plugins>, +			<plugin>, +				<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>, +				<artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>, +			</plugin>, +		</plugins>, +    </build>, +```, +, +If you need to access milestone or snapshot builds from Spring, +projects, you can optionallyt add repositories, as follows:, +, +```xml, +	<repositories>, +		<repository>, +			<id>spring-snapshots</id>, +			<url>http://repo.spring.io/snapshot</url>, +			<snapshots><enabled>true</enabled></snapshots>, +		</repository>, +		<repository>, +			<id>spring-milestones</id>, +			<url>http://repo.spring.io/milestone</url>, +			<snapshots><enabled>true</enabled></snapshots>, +		</repository>, +	</repositories>, +	<pluginRepositories>, +		<pluginRepository>, +			<id>spring-snapshots</id>, +			<url>http://repo.spring.io/snapshot</url>, +		</pluginRepository>, +		<pluginRepository>, +			<id>spring-milestones</id>, +			<url>http://repo.spring.io/milestone</url>, +		</pluginRepository>, +	</pluginRepositories>, +```]
