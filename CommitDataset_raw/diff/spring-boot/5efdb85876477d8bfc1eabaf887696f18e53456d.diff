[+++ b/spring-boot-docs/src/main/asciidoc/spring-boot-features.adoc, +NOTE: The getters and setters are advisable, since binding is via, +MVC. They are mandatory for immutable types or those that are directly, +coercable from `String`. As long as they are initialized maps and, +collections need a getter but not necessarily a setter, for instance,, +since they can be mutated by the binder. Maps and collections can also, +be created (if there is a setter) and expanded (in any case), but, +arrays can not (so normally arrays need to be bound to a, +comma-separated value, but lists can be bound to individual, +elements). Nested POJO properties can also be created (so a setter is, +not mandatory) if they have a default constructor, or a constructor, +accepting a single value that can be coerced from String. Some people, +use Project Lombok to add getters and setters automatically.]
