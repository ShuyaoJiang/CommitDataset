The , +`Environment` has a set of default profiles (by default `[default]`) which are, +used if no active profiels are set (i.e. if no profiles are explicitly activated, +then properties from `application-default.properties` are loaded)., +`application.properties`, with profile-specific files always overriding the non-specific, +enabled, then the value for the property will be `192.168.1.100`., +The default profiles are activated if none are explicitly active when the application, +context starts.
