[+++ b/spring-boot-tools/spring-boot-loader/README.md, +, +The Spring Boot Loader module allows JAR and WAR files that contain, +nested dependencies to be run using `java -jar archive.jar`. There are, +3 launcher classes (`JarLauncher`, `WarLauncher` and, +`PropertiesLauncher`). Their purpose is to load resources (.class, +files etc.) from nested JAR files or JAR files in directories (as, +opposed to explicitly on the classpath). In the case of the, +`[Jar|War]Launcher` the nested paths are fixed `(lib/*.jar` and, +`lib-provided/*.jar` for the WAR case) so you just add extra JARs in, +those locations if you want more. The `PropertiesLauncher` looks in, +`lib/` by default, but you can add additional locations by setting an, +environment variable `LOADER_PATH`or `loader.path` in, +`application.properties` (colon-separated list of directories).]
