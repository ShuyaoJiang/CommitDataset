[+++ b/spring-boot-docs/src/main/asciidoc/spring-boot-features.adoc, +TIP: You need to be very careful about the order that bean definitions are added as these, +conditions are evaluated based on what has been processed so far. For this reason,, +we recommend only  using `@ConditionalOnBean` and `@ConditionalOnMissingBean` annotations, +on auto-configuration classes (since these are guaranteed to load after any user-define, +beans definitions have been added)., +NOTE: `@ConditionalOnBean` and `@ConditionalOnMissingBean` do not prevent `@Configuration`, +classes from being created. Using these conditions at the class level is equivalent to, +marking each contained `@Bean` method with the annotation.]
