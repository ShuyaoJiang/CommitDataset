Any other compliant library can be added as well., +, +It might happen that more than one provider is present, in which case the provider must, +be explicitly specified. Even if the JSR-107 standard does not enforce a standardized, +way to define the location of the configuration file, Spring Boot does its best to, +accommodate with implementation details.]
