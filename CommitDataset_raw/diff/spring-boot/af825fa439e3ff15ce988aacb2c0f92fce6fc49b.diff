Set the appropriate properties as you would , +with any other Gradle extension (see below for a list of configuration options):, +[[build-tool-plugins-gradle-repackage-configuration]], +=== Repackage configuration, +The plugin adds a `bootRepackage` task which you can also configure directly, e.g.:, +, +[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes"], +----, +	bootRepackage {, +		mainClass = 'demo.Application', +	}, +----, +, +The following configuration options are available:, +, +[cols="2,4"], +|===, +|Name |Description, +, +|`mainClass`, +|The main class that should be run. If not specified the `mainClassName` project property, + will be used or, if the no `mainClassName` id defined the archive will be searched for a, + suitable class. "Suitable" means a unique class with a well-formed `main()` method (if, +more than one is found the build will fail). You should also be able to specify the main, +class name via the "run" task (`main` property) and/or the "startScripts" (`mainClassName` , +property) as an alternative to using the "springBoot" configuration., +, +|`classifier`, +|A file name segment (before the extension) to add to the archive, so that the original is, +preserved in its original location.
