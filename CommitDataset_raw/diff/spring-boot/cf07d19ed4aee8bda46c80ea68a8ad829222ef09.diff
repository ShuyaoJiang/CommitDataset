That's a sane behaviour for modules that represent an app but if, +  your module is used as a dependency of another module, you need to provide a, +  classifier for the repackaged one., +, +  The reason for that is that application classes are packaged in <<<BOOT-INF/classes>>>, +  so that the dependent module cannot load a repackaged jar's classes. If that is the, +  case or if you prefer to keep the original artifact and attach the repackaged one, +  with a different classifier, configure the plugin as follows:, +  This configuration will generate two artifacts: the original one and the repackaged counter, +  part produced by the repackage goal. Both will be installed/deployed transparently.]
