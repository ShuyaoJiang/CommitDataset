[+++ b/spring-boot-docs/src/main/asciidoc/spring-boot-features.adoc, +`logging.config`. (Note however that since logging is initialized *before* the `ApplicationContext, +is created, it isn't possible to control logging from `@PropertySources` in Spring, +`@Configuration` files.  System properties and the conventional Spring Boot external, +configuration files work just fine.)]
