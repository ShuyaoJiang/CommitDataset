[+++ b/CONTRIBUTING.md, +# Contributing to Spring Boot, +Spring Boot is released under the non-restrictive Apache 2.0 license. If you would like, +to contribute something, or simply want to hack on the code this document should help, +you get started., +, +## Working with the code, +If you don't have an IDE preference we would recommend that you use, +[Spring Tools Suite](http://www.springsource.com/developer/sts) or, +[Eclipse](http://eclipse.org) when working with the code. We use the, +[m2eclipe](http://eclipse.org/m2e/) eclipse plugin for maven support. Other IDEs, +and tools should also work without issue., +, +### Building from source, +To build the source you will need to install, +[Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/run-maven/index.html) v3.0 or above. The project, +can be build using the standard maven command:, +, +	$ mvn clean install, +, +If you are rebuilding often, you might also want to skip the tests until you are ready, +to submit a pull request:, +, +	$ mvn clean install -DskipTests, +, +### Importing into eclipse with m2eclipse, +We recommend the [m2eclipe](http://eclipse.org/m2e/) eclipse plugin when working with, +eclipse. If you don't already have m2eclipse installed it is available from the "eclipse, +marketplace"., +, +Spring Boot includes project specific source formatting settings, in order to have these, +work with m2eclipse, we provide an additional eclipse plugin that you can install:, +, +* Select `Install new software` from the `help` menu, +* Click `Add...` to add a new repository, +* Click the `Archive...` button, +* Select `org.eclipse.m2e.maveneclipse.site-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-site.zip`, +  from the `eclipse` folder in this checkout, +* Install "Maven Integration for the maven-eclipse-plugin", +, +_NOTE: This plugin is optional. Projects can be imported without the plugin, your code, +changes just won't be automatically formatted._, +, +With the requisite eclipse plugins installed you can select, +`import existing maven projects` from the `file` menu to import the code. You will, +need to import the root `spring-boot` pom and the `spring-boot-samples` pom separately., +, +### Importing into eclipse without m2eclipse, +If you prefer not to use m2eclipse you can generate eclipse project meta-data using the, +following command:, +, +	$ mvn eclipse:eclipse, +, +The generated eclipse projects can be imported by selecting `import existing projects`, +from the `file` menu., +, +### Importing into other IDEs, +Maven is well supported by most Java IDEs. Refer to you vendor documentation., +, +### Integration tests, +The sample application are used as integration tests during the build (when you , +`mvn install`). Due to the fact that they make use of the `spring-boot-maven-plugin` , +they cannot be called directly, and so instead are launched via the , +`maven-invoker-plugin`. If you encounter build failures running the integration tests, , +check the `build.log` file in the appropriate sample directory., +, +++ b/CONTRIBUTING.md, +# Contributing to Spring Boot, +Spring Boot is released under the non-restrictive Apache 2.0 license.
