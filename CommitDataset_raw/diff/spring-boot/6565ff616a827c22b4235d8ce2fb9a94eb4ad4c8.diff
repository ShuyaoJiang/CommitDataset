If, +your application contains classes that you want to share with other projects, the, +recommended approach is to move that code into a separate module. The separate module can, +then be depended upon by your application and other projects., +If you cannot rearrange your code as recommended above, Spring Boot's Maven and Gradle, +plugins must be configured to produce a separate artifact that is suitable for use as a, +dependency. The executable archive cannot be used as a dependency as the, +<<appendix-executable-jar-format.adoc#executable-jar-jar-file-structure,exectuable jar, +format>> packages application classes in `BOOT-INF/classes`. This means, +that they cannot be found when the executable jar is used as a dependency., +, +To produce the two artifacts, one that can be used as a dependency and one that is, +executable, a classifier must be specified. This classifier is applied to the name of the, +executable archive, leaving the default archive for use as dependency., +, +To configure a classifier of `exec` in Maven, the following configuration can be used:, +And when using Gradle, the following configuration can be used:]
