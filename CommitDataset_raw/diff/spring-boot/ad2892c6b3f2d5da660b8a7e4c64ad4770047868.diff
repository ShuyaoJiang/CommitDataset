[+++ b/spring-boot-starters/README.adoc, +Spring Boot Starters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors, +that you can include in your application. You get a one-stop-shop for, +all the Spring and related technology that you need without having to, +hunt through sample code and copy paste loads of dependency, +descriptors. For example, if you want to get started using Spring and, +JPA for database access just include the, +`spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` dependency in your project, and you are, +good to go., +, +=== Community Contributions, +, +If you create a starter for a technology that is not already in the standard list we can list it here. Just send a pull request for this page., +, +|===, +| Name | Location, +, +| WRO4J | https://github.com/sbuettner/spring-boot-autoconfigure-wro4j[https://github.com/sbuettner/spring-boot-autoconfigure-wro4j]]
