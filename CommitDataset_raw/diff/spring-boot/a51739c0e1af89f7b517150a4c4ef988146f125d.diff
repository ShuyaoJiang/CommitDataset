You can therefore use this feature to run a battery of integration tests, +where the server would actually start prior to the tests. In that case, it would be better, +to make sure that your integration tests use a random port for the main server and the, +management one, something like:, +[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"], +----, +	@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class), +	@SpringApplicationConfiguration(classes = MyApplication.class), +	@WebAppConfiguration, +	@IntegrationTest({"server.port=0", "management.port"}), +	public class SomeIntegrationTests { ... }, +, +----, +, +See <<howto-discover-the-http-port-at-runtime>> for a description of how you can discover, +the actual port that was allocated for the duration of the tests.]
