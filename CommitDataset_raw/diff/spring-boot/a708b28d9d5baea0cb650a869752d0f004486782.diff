When accessed anonymously, any details about the server's health, +are hidden and the endpoint will simply indicate whether or not the server is up or, +down. Furthermore, when accessed anonymously, the response is cached for a configurable, +period to prevent the endpoint being used in a denial of service attack., +The `endpoints.health.time-to-live` property is used to configure the caching period in, +milliseconds. It defaults to 1000, i.e. one second., +, +The above-described restrictions can be disabled, thereby allowing anonymous users full, +access to the health endpoint. To do so, set `endpoints.health.restrict-anonymous-access`, +to `false`., +, +, +]
