[+++ b/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-docs/src/main/asciidoc/spring-boot-features.adoc, +Spring Boot ships with many auto-configurations that may define Filter beans. Here are a, +few examples of Filters and their respective order (lower order value means higher, +precedence):, +It is usually safe to leave Filter beans unordered., +If a specific order is required, you should avoid configuring a Filter that reads the, +request body at `Ordered.HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE`, since it might go against the character, +encoding configuration of your application. If a Servlet filter wraps the request, it, +should be configured with an order that is less than or equal to, +`FilterRegistrationBean.REQUEST_WRAPPER_FILTER_MAX_ORDER`.]
