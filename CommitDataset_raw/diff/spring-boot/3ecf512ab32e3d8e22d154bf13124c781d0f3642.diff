[+++ b/spring-boot-docs/src/main/asciidoc/howto.adoc, +values are `none`, `validate`, `update`, `create`, `create-drop`. Spring Boot chooses a, +default value for you based on whether it thinks your database is embedded (default, +`create-drop`) or not (default `none`). An embedded database is detected by looking at the, +`Connection` type: `hsqldb`, `h2` and `derby` are embedded, the rest are not. Be careful, +when switching from in-memory to a '`real`' database that you don't make assumptions about, +the existence of the tables and data in the new platform. You either have to set `ddl-auto`, +explicitly, or use one of the other mechanisms to initialize the database.]
