[+++ b/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-docs/src/main/asciidoc/howto.adoc, +Spring Boot has no mandatory logging dependency, except for the Commons Logging API, which, +is typically provided by Spring Framework's `spring-jcl` module. To use, +http://logback.qos.ch[Logback], you need to include it and `sprign-jcl` on the classpath., +The simplest way to do that is through the starters, which all depend on, +`spring-boot-starter-logging`. For a web application, you need only, +`spring-boot-starter-web`, since it depends transitively on the logging starter. If you, +use Maven, the following dependency adds logging for you:, +instead. If you do not use the starters, you need to provide (at least) `spring-jcl` in, +addition to Log4j 2.]
