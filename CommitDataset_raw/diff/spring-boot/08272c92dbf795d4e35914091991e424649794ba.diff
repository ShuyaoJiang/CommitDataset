If you provide that hint, you still need, +to transform the bean name into an actual Bean reference using by the `ApplicationContext`., +Properties are discovered through the presence of standard getters and setters with, +special handling for collection types (that is detected even if only a getter is present)., +The annotation processor also supports the use of the `@Data`, `@Getter`, and `@Setter`, +lombok annotations., +The preceding example produces metdata information for `server.name`, `server.host.ip`,, +and `server.host.port` properties. You can use the `@NestedConfigurationProperty`]
