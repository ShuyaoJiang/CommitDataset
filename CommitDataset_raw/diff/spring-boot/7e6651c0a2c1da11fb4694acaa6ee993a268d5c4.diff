[+++ b/README.md, +Spring Bootstrap is "Spring for Snowboarders".  If you are kewl, or, +just impatient, and you want to use Spring, then this is the place to, +be. Spring Bootstrap is a toolkit and runtime platform that will get, +you up and running with Spring-powered, production-grade applications, +and services with absolute minimum fuss. It takes an opinionated view, +of the Spring family so that new and existing users can quickly get to, +the bits they need. Assumes no knowledge of the Java development, +ecosystem. Absolutely no code generation and no XML (unless you really, +want it)., +The goals are:, +* Radically faster and widely accessible getting started experience, +  for Spring development, +* Be opinionated out of the box, but get out of the way quickly as, +  requirements start to diverge from the defaults, +* Provide a range of non-functional features that are common to large, +  classes of projects (e.g. embedded servers, security, metrics,, +  health checks, externalized configuration), +* First class support for REST-ful services, modern web applications,, +  batch jobs, and enterprise integration, +* Applications that adapt their behaviour or configuration to their, +  environment, +* Optionally use Groovy features like DSLs and AST transformations to, +  accelerate the implementation of basic business requirements, +1) Get Java.  Download and install the Java SDK from www.java.com, +, +     $ curl -s try.spring.io | bash, +     , +   or use the Windows installer, +    $ cat > app.groovy, +    $ spring run app.groovy, +    $ curl localhost:8080, +    Hello World!, +## What? It's Groovy then? or like Grails? or another Roo?, +, +There is a command line tool that uses Groovy underneath so that we, +can present simple snippets that can just run just like the slimline, +`app.groovy` example above.  Groovy makes this really easy., +, +If you don't want to use the command line tool, or you would rather, +work using Java and an IDE you can. Just add a `main()` method that, +calls `SpringApplication` and add `@EnableAutoConfiguration`:, +, +, +	import org.springframework.bootstrap.context.annotation.*;, +	@EnableAutoConfiguration, +, +            public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {, +			SpringApplication.run(SampleController.class, args);, +    }, +, +## Spring Bootstrap Themes, +, +There are a number of themes in Bootstrap. Here are the important, +ones:, +The 'spring' command line application compiles and runs Groovy source,, +making it super easy to write the absolute minimum of code to get an, +application running. Spring CLI can also watch files, automatically, +recompiling and restarting when they change., +### Bootstrap Core, +The main library providing features that support the other parts of, +Spring Bootstrap.  Features include:, +* `SpringApplication` - a class with static convenience methods that, +  make it really easy to write a standalone Spring Application. Its, +  sole job is to create and refresh an appropriate Spring, +  `ApplicationContext`., +* Embedded web applications with a choice of container (Tomcat or, +  Jetty for now), +* `@EnableAutoConfigure` is an annotation that triggers, +  auto-configuration of the Spring context. Auto-configuration, +  attempts to guess what beans a user might want based on their, +  classpath. For example, If a 'HSQLDB' is on the classpath the user, +  probably wants an in-memory database to be, +  defined. Auto-configuration will back away as the user starts to, +  define their own beans., +* `@Conditional` is an annotation in Spring 4.0 that allows you to, +  control which parts of an application are used at runtime. Spring, +  Bootstrap provides some concrete implementations of conditional, +  configuration, e.g. `@ConditionalOnBean`,, +  `@ConditionalOnMissingBean` and `@ConditionalOnClass`., +, +### Spring Bootstrap Service, +, +<!-- FIXME: change the name -->, +, +Spring Bootstrap Service uses auto-configuration features to decorate, +your application with features that make it instantly deployable and, +supportable in production.  For instance if you are writing a JSON web, +service then it will provide a server, security, logging, externalized, +configuration, management endpoints, an audit abstraction, and more., +If you want to switch off the built in features, or extend or replace, +them, it makes that really easy as well., +, +### Spring Bootstrap Applications, +, +<!-- FIXME: change the name -->, +, +Spring Bootstrap Applications are a set of convenient dependency, +descriptors that you can include in your application.  You get a, +one-stop-shop for all the Spring and related technology that you need]
