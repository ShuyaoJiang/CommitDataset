[+++ b/spring-boot-docs/src/main/asciidoc/spring-boot-features.adoc, +[[boot-features-spring-hateoas]], +==== Spring HATEOAS, +If you're developing a RESTful API that makes use of hypermedia, Spring Boot provides, +auto-configuration for Spring HATEOAS that works well with most applications. The, +auto-configuration replaces the need to use `@EnableHypermediaSupport` and registers a, +number of beans to ease building hypermedia-based applications including a, +`LinkDiscoverer` and an `ObjectMapper` configured to correctly marshal responses into, +the desired representation. The `ObjectMapper` will be customized based on the, +`spring.jackson.*` properties or a `Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder` bean if one exists., +, +You can take control of Spring HATEOAS's configuration by using, +`@EnableHypermediaSupport`. Note that this will disable the `ObjectMapper` customization, +described above., +, +, +]
