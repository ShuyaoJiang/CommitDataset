To tweak the defaults try setting properties, +in `security.*` (see, +[SecurityProperties](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/master/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/security/SecurityProperties.java), +for details of available settings)., +, +(e.g. [various authentication options](http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/3.2.1.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#jc-authentication))., +, +Spring Security also provides a convenient, +`AuthenticationManagerBuilder` which can be used to build an, +`AuthenticationManager` with common options. The recommended way to, +use this in a webapp is to inject it into a void method in a, +`WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`, e.g., +, +```, +@Configuration, +@Order(0), +public class SecurityConfiguration extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {, +, +    @Autowired, +    protected void init(AuthenticationManagerBuilder builder) {, +        builder.inMemoryAuthentication().withUser("barry"); // ...  etc., +    }, +    , +    // ... other stuff for application security, +, +}, +```, +, +The configuration class that does this should declare an `@Order` so, +that it is used before the default one in Spring Boot (which has very, +low precedence)., +[`DataSourceAutoConfiguration`](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/master/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/jdbc/DataSourceAutoConfiguration.java), +additional JAR files on your classpath., +, +A running application with the Actuator features has a "/configprops", +endpoint that shows all the bound and bindable properties available, +through `@ConfigurationProperties` (also exposed through JMX if you, +don't have a web endpoint)., +, +There is a sample]
