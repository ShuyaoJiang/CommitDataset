[+++ b/spring-boot-docs/src/main/asciidoc/spring-boot-features.adoc, +When you're using one of these templating engines with the default configuration, your, +templates will be picked up automatically from `src/main/resources/templates`., +, +TIP: IntelliJ IDEA orders the classpath differently depending on how you run your, +application. Running your application in the IDE via its main method will result in a, +different ordering to when you run your application using Maven or Gradle or from its, +pacakaged jar. This can cause Spring Boot to fail to find the templates on the classpath., +If you're affected by this problem you can reorder the classpath in the IDE to place, +the module's classes and resources first. Alternatively, you can configure the template, +prefix to search every templates directory on the classpath: `classpath*:/templates/`., +]
