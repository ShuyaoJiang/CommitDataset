[+++ b/docs/howto.md, +A Spring Boot application deployed as a WAR file has most of the same, +features as one executed from an archive, or from source code. For, +example, `@Beans` of type `Servlet` and `Filter` will be detected and, +mapped on startup. An exception is error page declarations, which is, +essentially a consequence of the fact that there is no Java API in the, +Servlet spec for adding error pages. You have to add a `web.xml` with, +a global error page mapped to "/error" for the deployed WAR to work, +the same way if it has error page mappings (all Actuator apps have an, +error page by default). Example:, +, +```xml, +<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>, +<web-app version="3.0" xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee", +	xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance", +	xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_3_0.xsd">, +	<error-page>, +		<location>/error</location>, +	</error-page>, +</web-app>, +```, +]
