[+++ b/README.md, +Since release [v1.4.0](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/releases/tag/v1.4.0), the `ColorTemplate` object that was responsible for setting colors in previous releases is no longer needed. Nevertheless, it still holds all predefined color arrays (e.g. `ColorTemplate.VORDIPLOM_COLORS` and provides convenience methods for transforming colors from the resources (resource integers) into "real" colors., +Instead of the `ColorTemplate`, colors can now be specified directly via `DataSet` object, which allows separate styling for each `DataSet`., +In this short example, we have our two different `LineDataSet` objects representing the quarterly revenues of two companies (previously mentioned in the **Adding data** tutorial), for which we now want to set different colors., +What we want:, + - the values of "Company 1" should be represented by four different variations of the color "red", + - the values of "Company 2" should be represented by four different variations of the color "green", +, +This is what the code looks like:, +, +  LineDataSet setComp1 = new LineDataSet(valsComp1, "Company 1");, +  , +  // sets colors for the dataset, resolution of the resource name to a "real" color is done internally, +  setComp1.setColors(new int[] { R.color.red1, R.color.red2, R.color.red3, R.color.red4 }, Context);, +  , +  LineDataSet setComp2 = new LineDataSet(valsComp2, "Company 2");, +  setComp2.setColors(new int[] { R.color.green1, R.color.green2, R.color.green3, R.color.green4 }, Context);, +Besides that, there are many other ways for setting colors for a `DataSet`. Here is the full documentation:, +, + - , +, +, +If no colors are set for a `DataSet`, default colors are used., +, +For customizing the `Legend`, use you can retreive the `Legend` object from the chart **after setting data** using the `getLegend()` method., +]
