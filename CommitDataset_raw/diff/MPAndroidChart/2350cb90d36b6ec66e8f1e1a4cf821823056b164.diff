[+++ b/README.md, +So, what is a <code>DataSet</code> and why do you need it? That is actually pretty simple. One <code>DataSet</code> objects represents a group or type of entries (values) inside the chart that belong together. It is designed to logically separate different groups of values in the chart. As an example, you might want to display the quarterly revenue of two different companies over one year. In that case, it would be recommended to create two different <code>DataSet</code> objects, each containing four values (one for each quarter). As an <code>ArrayList<String></code> to describe the legend on the x-axis, you would simply provide the four Strings "1.Q", "2.Q", "3.Q", "4.Q"., +Putting it all together (example of two companies with quarterly revenue over one year):, +    Entry c1e1 = new Entry(100.000f, 0); // 0 == quarter 1, +    Entry c1e2 = new Entry(50.000f, 1; // 1 == quarter 2 ..., +    Entry c2e1 = new Entry(120.000f, 0); // 0 == quarter 1, +    Entry c2e2 = new Entry(110.000f, 1; // 1 == quarter 2 ..., +Now, our <code>ChartData</code> object can be set to the chart. But before that, **colors need to be specified**. , +, +, +**Setting colors:**, +, +Setting colors can be done via the <code>ColorTemplate</code> class that already comes with some predefined colors (constants of the template). In our example case, we want one color for each <code>DataSet</code> (red and green).]
