[+++ b/README.md, +If you are having questions or problems, feel free to contact me, **create issues** for this project on GitHub or open questions on [**stackoverflow**](https://stackoverflow.com) with the `mpandroidchart` tag., +, +Forks, pull-requests or any other forms of contribution are always welcome., +, + - <code>setScaleMinima(float x, float y)</code>: Sets the minimum scale factors for x- and y-axis. If set for example to 3f, the user will not be able to fully zoom out., + - <code>centerViewPort(int xIndex, float val)</code>: This method makes it possible to aim the center of the view (what you can see from the chart) to a specific position inside the chart, described by the index on the x-axis and the value on the y-axis. This also works very well in combination with the `setScaleMinima(...)` method., +    public DataSet(ArrayList<Entry> yVals, String label) { ... }, +When looking at the constructor, it is visible that the <code>DataSet</code> needs an <code>ArrayList</code> of type <code>Entry</code> and a `String` used to describe the `DataSet` and as a label for the `Legend`. Furthermore this label can be used to find the `DataSet` amongst other `DataSet` objects in the `Chartdata` object., +    DataSet setComp1 = new DataSet(valsComp1, "company 1");, +    DataSet setComp2 = new DataSet(valsComp2, "company 2");]
