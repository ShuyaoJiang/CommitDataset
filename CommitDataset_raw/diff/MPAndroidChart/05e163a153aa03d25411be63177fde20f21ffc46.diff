[+++ b/README.md, +For immediate access to our latest updates, please checkout the **experimental** branch. Beware that code on the experimental branch is not finished for release yet and might be incomplete or contain bugs., +, +So, what is a <code>DataSet</code> and why do you need it? That is actually pretty simple. One <code>DataSet</code> object represents a group of entries (datatype <code>Entry</code>) inside the chart that belong together. It is designed to logically separate different groups of values in the chart. As an example, you might want to display the quarterly revenue of two different companies over one year. In that case, it would be recommended to create two different <code>DataSet</code> objects, each containing four values (one for each quarter). As an <code>ArrayList<String></code> to describe the legend on the x-axis, you would simply provide the four Strings "1.Q", "2.Q", "3.Q", "4.Q"., +When looking at the constructor, it is visible that the <code>DataSet</code> needs an <code>ArrayList</code> of type <code>Entry</code> and an integer value for the type. The type integer value can be chosen freely and can be used to identify the <code>DataSet</code> amongst other <code>DataSet</code> objects in the <code>ChartData</code> object. A possible type in this scenario could be a integer constant COMPANY_1.]
