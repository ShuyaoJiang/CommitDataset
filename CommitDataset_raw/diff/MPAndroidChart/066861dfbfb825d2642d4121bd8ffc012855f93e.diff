[+++ b/README.md, +As an example, you might want to display the quarterly revenue of two different companies over one year in a `LineChart`. In that case, it would be recommended to create two different <code>LineDataSet</code> objects, each containing four values (one for each quarter). As an <code>ArrayList<String></code> to describe the labels on the x-axis, you would simply provide the four Strings "1.Q", "2.Q", "3.Q", "4.Q"., +Of course, it is also possible to provide just one <code>LineDataSet</code> object containing all 8 values for the two companys. , +When looking at the constructor, it is visible that the <code>LineDataSet</code> needs an <code>ArrayList</code> of type <code>Entry</code> and a `String` used to describe the `LineDataSet` and as a label used for the `Legend`. Furthermore this label can be used to find the `LineDataSet` amongst other `LineDataSet` objects in the `LineData` object., +    LineDataSet setComp1 = new LineDataSet(valsComp1, "Company 1");, +    LineDataSet setComp2 = new LineDataSet(valsComp2, "Company 2");]
