[+++ b/README, +Note that this project no longer contains SaaS provider-specific connectivity, +and API bindings. Each of the provider-specific modules is now in its own project., +This will enable those modules to progress and release on a separate schedule, +than Spring Social and be able to react more quickly to changes in the provider's, +API without the need to wait for a Spring Social release., +, +The SaaS provider-specific projects can be cloned from the following GitHub, +URLs:, +, +Twitter: git://github.com/SpringSource/spring-social-twitter.git, +Facebook: git://github.com/SpringSource/spring-social-facebook.git, +LinkedIn: git://github.com/SpringSource/spring-social-linkedin.git, +TripIt: git://github.com/SpringSource/spring-social-tripit.git, +GitHub: git://github.com/SpringSource/spring-social-github.git, +Gowalla: git://github.com/SpringSource/spring-social-gowalla.git, +, +Each of these projects uses the same build submodule as Spring Social. Thus,, +you'll need to either clone them with the --recursive switch or init/update the, +submodule as described above from Spring Social., +, +-------------------------------------------------------------------------------]
