Each of the provider modules is in its own project. This enables those modules to progress and release on a separate schedule than Spring Social and be able to react more quickly to changes in the provider's API without the need to wait for a Spring Social release. The SaaS provider-specific projects can be cloned from the following GitHub URLs:, +, +- Twitter: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-social-twitter, +, +- Facebook: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-social-facebook, +, +- LinkedIn: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-social-linkedin, +, +- TripIt: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-social-tripit, +, +- GitHub: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-social-github, +, +, +## Documentation, +, +See the current [Javadoc] and [reference docs].
