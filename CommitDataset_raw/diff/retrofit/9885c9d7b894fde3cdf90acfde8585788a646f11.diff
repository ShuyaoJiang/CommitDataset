[+++ b/CHANGELOG.md, +Version 2.0.0-beta2 *(2015-09-28)*, +----------------------------------, +, + * New: Using a response type of `Void` (e.g., `Call<Void>`) will ignore and discard the response body. This, +   can be used when there will be no response body (such as in a 201 response) or whenever the body is not, +   needed. `@Head` requests are now forced to use this as their response type., + * New: `validateEagerly()` method on `Retrofit.Builder` will verify the correctness of all service methods, +   on calls to `create()` instead of lazily validating on first use., + * New: `Converter` is now parameterized over both 'from' and 'to' types with a single `convert` method., +   `Converter.Factory` is now an abstract class and has factory methods for both request body and response, +   body., + * New: `Converter.Factory` and `CallAdapter.Factory` now receive the method annotations when being created, +   for a return/response type and the parameter annotations when being created for a parameter type., + * New: `callAdapter()` method on `Retrofit` allows querying a `CallAdapter` for a given type. The, +   `nextCallAdapter()` method allows delegating to another `CallAdapter` from within a `CallAdapter.Factory`., +   This is useful for composing call adapters to incrementally build up behavior., + * New: `requestConverter()` and `responseConverter()` methods on `Retrofit` allow querying a `Converter` for, +   a given type., + * New: `onResponse` method in `Callback` now receives the `Retrofit` instance. Combined with the, +   `responseConverter()` method on `Retrofit`, this provides a way of deserializing an error body on `Response`., +   See the `DeserializeErrorBody` sample for an example., + * New: The `MoshiConverterFactory` has been updated for its v1.0.0., + * Fix: Using `ResponseBody` for the response type or `RequestBody` for a parameter type is now correctly, +   identified. Previously these types would erroneously be passed to the supplied converter., + * Fix: The encoding of `@Path` values has been corrected to conform to OkHttp's `HttpUrl`., + * Fix: Use form-data content disposition subtype for `@Multipart`., + * Fix: `Observable` and `Single`-based execution of requests now behave synchronously (and thus requires, +   `subscribeOn()` for running in the background)., + * Fix: Correct `GsonConverterFactory` to honor the configuration of the `Gson` instances (such as not, +   serializing null values, the default)., +, +, +++ b/CHANGELOG.md, +Version 2.0.0-beta2 *(2015-09-28)*, +----------------------------------, +, + * New: Using a response type of `Void` (e.g., `Call<Void>`) will ignore and discard the response body.
