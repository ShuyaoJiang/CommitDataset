[+++ b/website/index.html, +            <h4>JSON Conversion</h4>, +            <p>Retrofit uses <a href="https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/">Gson</a> to convert HTTP bodies to and from JSON. If you want to specify behavior that is different from Gson's defaults (e.g. naming policies, date formats, custom types), you should provide a new <code>Gson</code> instance with your desired behavior when building a <code>RestAdapter</code>. Retrofit itself does not provide any additional customization options, so refer to the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/gson/gson-user-guide">Gson documentation</a> for more details on customization.</p>, +            <p>The <code>gson</code> instance is passed as a parameter to a new <code>GsonConverter</code>, which is simply a wrapper class used by Retrofit.</p>]
