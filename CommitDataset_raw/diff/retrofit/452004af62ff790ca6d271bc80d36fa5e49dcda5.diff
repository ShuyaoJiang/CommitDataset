[+++ b/CHANGELOG.md, +Version 2.0.0-beta3 *(2015-01-05)*, +----------------------------------, +, + * New: All classes have been migrated to the `retrofit2.*` package name. The Maven groupId is now, +   `com.squareup.retrofit2`. This is in accordance with the, +   [Java Interoperability Policy for Major Version Updates](http://jakewharton.com/java-interoperability-policy-for-major-version-updates/)., +   With this change Retrofit 2.x can coexiest with Retrofit 1.x in the same project., + * New: Update to use the OkHttp 3 API and OkHttp 3.0.0-RC1 or newer is now required. Similar to the previous, +   point, OkHttp has a new package name (`okhttp3.*`) and Maven groupId (`com.squareup.okhttp3`) which allow, +   it to coexist with OkHttp 2.x in the same project., + * New: String converters allow for custom serialization of parameters that end up as strings (such as `@Path`,, +   `@Query`, `@Header`, etc.). `Converter.Factory` has a new `stringConverter` method which receives the, +   parameter type and annotations and can return a converter for that type. This allows providing custom, +   rendering of types like `Date`, `User`, etc. to a string before being used for its purpose. A default, +   converter will call `toString()` for any type which retains the mimics the previous behavior., + * New: OkHttp's `Call.Factory` type is now used as the HTTP client rather than using the `OkHttpClient` type, +   directly (`OkHttpClient` does implement `Call.Factory`). A `callFactory` method has been added to both, +   `Retrofit.Builder` and `Retrofit` to allow supplying alternate implementations of an HTTP client. The, +   `client(OkHttpClient)` method on `Retrofit.Builder` still exists as a convenience., + * New: `isExecuted()` method returns whether a `Call` has been synchronously or asynchronously executed., + * New: `isCanceled()` method returns whether a `Call` has been canceled. Use this in `onFailure` to determine, +   whether the callback was invoked from cancelation or actual transport failure., + * New: `converter-scalars` module provides a `Converter.Factory` for converting `String`, the 8 primitive, +   types, and the 8 boxed primitive types as `text/plain` bodies. Install this before your normal converter, +   to avoid passing these simple scalars through, for example, a JSON converter., + * New: `Converter.Factory` methods now receive a `Retrofit` instance which also now has methods for querying, +   the next converter for a given type. This allows implementations to delegate to others and provide, +   additional behavior without complete reimplementation., + * New: `@OPTIONS` annotation more easily allows for making OPTIONS requests., + * New: `@Part` annotation now supports `List` and array types., + * New: The `@Url` annotation now allows using `java.net.URI` or `android.net.Uri` (in addition to `String`), +   as parameter types for providing relative or absolute endpoint URLs dynamically., + * New: The `retrofit-mock` module has been rewritten with a new `BehaviorDelegate` class for implementing, +   fake network behavior in a local mock implementation of your service endpoints. Documentation and more, +   tests are forthcoming, but the `SimpleMockService` demonstrates its use for now., + * Fix: Forbid Retrofit's `Response` type and OkHttp's `Response` type as the response body type given to, +   a `Call` (i.e., `Call<Response>`). OkHttp's `ResponseBody` type is the correct one to use when the raw, +   body contents are desired., + * Fix: The Gson converter now respects settings on the supplied `Gson` instance (such as `serializeNulls`)., +   This requires Gson 2.4 or newer., + * The Wire converter has been updated to the Wire 2.0 API., + * The change in 2.0.0-beta2 which provided the `Retrofit` instance to the `onResponse` callback of `Callback`, +   has been reverted. There are too many edge cases around providing the `Retrofit` object in order to allow, +   deserialization of the error body. To accommodate this use case, pass around the `Retrofit` response, +   manually or implement a custom `CallAdapter.Factory` does so automatically., +, +, +++ b/CHANGELOG.md, +Version 2.0.0-beta3 *(2015-01-05)*, +----------------------------------, +, + * New: All classes have been migrated to the `retrofit2.*` package name.
