[+++ b/website/index.html, +              <p>If you need to communicate with an API that uses a content-format that Retrofit does not support out of the box (e.g. YAML, txt, custom format) or you wish to use a different library to implement an existing format, you can easily create your own converter. Create a class that extends the <a href="https://github.com/square/retrofit/blob/master/retrofit/src/main/java/retrofit/Converter.java"><code>Converter.Factory</code> class</a> and pass in an instance when building your adapter.</p>]
