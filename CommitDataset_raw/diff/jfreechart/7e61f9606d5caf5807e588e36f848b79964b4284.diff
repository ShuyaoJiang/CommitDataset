[+++ b/source/org/jfree/chart/axis/SymbolAxis.java, + * 08-Sep-2014 : Update Javadocs for grid bands (DG):, +     * Returns the flag that controls whether or not grid bands are drawn for , +     * the axis.  The default value is {@code true}. , +     * @return A boolean., +     * Sets the flag that controls whether or not grid bands are drawn for this, +     * axis and notifies registered listeners that the axis has been modified., +     * Each band is the area between two adjacent gridlines , +     * running perpendicular to the axis.  When the bands are drawn they are , +     * filled with the colors {@link #getGridBandPaint()} and , +     * {@link #getGridBandAlternatePaint()} in an alternating sequence., +     * Returns the paint used to color grid bands (two colors are used, +     * alternately, the other is returned by , +     * {@link #getGridBandAlternatePaint()}).  The default value is, +     * {@link #DEFAULT_GRID_BAND_PAINT}., +     * @return The paint (never {@code null})., +     * Sets the grid band paint and notifies registered listeners that the, +     * axis has been changed.  See the {@link #setGridBandsVisible(boolean)}, +     * method for more information about grid bands., +     * @param paint  the paint ({@code null} not permitted)., +     * Returns the second paint used to color grid bands (two colors are used, +     * alternately, the other is returned by {@link #getGridBandPaint()}).  , +     * The default value is {@link #DEFAULT_GRID_BAND_ALTERNATE_PAINT} , +     * (transparent)., +     * @return The paint (never {@code null})., +     * Sets the grid band paint and notifies registered listeners that the, +     * axis has been changed.
