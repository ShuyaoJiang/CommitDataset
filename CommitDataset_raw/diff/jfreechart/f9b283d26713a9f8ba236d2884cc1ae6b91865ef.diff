[+++ b/source/org/jfree/chart/ChartPanel.java, +    /**, +     * Default setting for buffer usage.  The default has been changed to, +     * <code>true</code> from version 1.0.13 onwards, because of a severe, +     * performance problem with drawing the zoom rectangle using XOR (which, +     * now happens only when the buffer is NOT used)., +     */, +     * Constructs a panel containing a chart.  The <code>useBuffer</code> flag, +     * controls whether or not an offscreen <code>BufferedImage</code> is, +     * maintained for the chart.  If the buffer is used, more memory is, +     * consumed, but panel repaints will be a lot quicker in cases where the, +     * chart itself hasn't changed (for example, when another frame is moved, +     * to reveal the panel).  WARNING: If you set the <code>useBuffer</code>, +     * flag to false, note that the mouse zooming rectangle will (in that case), +     * be drawn using XOR, and there is a SEVERE performance problem with that, +     * on JRE6 on Windows., +     *                   is used (read the warning above before setting this, +     *                   to <code>false</code>).]
