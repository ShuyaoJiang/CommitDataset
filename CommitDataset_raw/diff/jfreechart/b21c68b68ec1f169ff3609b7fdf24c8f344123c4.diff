[+++ b/NEWS, +JFreeChart 1.0.13, +-----------------, +?? ??? 2009, +, +This release contains enhancements to many of the CategoryItemRenderer, +implementations to ensure that they respect the 'seriesVisible' flags, some, +important fixes in the LogAxis class, an improvement to the TimeSeries class, +so that it is no longer necessary to specify the time period type in the, +constructor, plus some changes to the ChartPanel class that help to, +work around a regression in JRE 1.6.0_10.  Regarding this final point:, +, +- the default value for the useBuffer flag has changed to true, which means, +  that all charts will, by default, be rendered into an off-screen image, +  before being displayed in the ChartPanel;, +- the zoom rectangle is drawn using XOR *only* when the useBuffer flag has, +  been set to false., +, +For most usage, this should improve performance (but at the cost of using more, +memory for each ChartPanel used in your application)., +, +]
