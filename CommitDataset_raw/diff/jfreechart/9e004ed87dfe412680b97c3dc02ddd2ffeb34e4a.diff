[+++ b/src/main/java/org/jfree/chart/axis/DateTickUnit.java, +     * The {@code rollUnitType} and {@code rollCount} are intended to roll the date forward when it falls on a "hidden" part of the DateAxis. For example, if the tick size is 1 week (7 days), but Saturday and Sunday are hidden, if the ticks happen to fall on Saturday, none of them will be visible. A sensible {@code rollUnitType}/{@code rollCount} would be 1 day, so that the date would roll forward to the following Monday, which is visible., +     *]
