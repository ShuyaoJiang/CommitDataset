[+++ b/README.md, +###### Bug Fixes, +###### Patches, +###### Bug Fixes, +###### Patches, +###### Bug Fixes, +, +******************************************************************************, +* SPECIAL NOTICE:  There will be a birds-of-a-feather session for JFreeChart *, +* at this year's JavaOne conference in San Francisco.  The session is        *, +* scheduled for 6.45pm to 7.35pm on Wednesday 3 June.                        *, +******************************************************************************, +, +This release contains:, +, +- updates to the ChartPanel class to support copying charts to the clipboard, , +  panning and mouse-wheel zooming, and an overlay mechanism that supports, +  crosshairs;, +- enhancements to the auto-range calculation for axes, providing the ability, +  to use subranges only and also to skip hidden series;, +- updates for many of the CategoryItemRenderer implementations to ensure that, +  they respect the 'seriesVisible' flags;, +- an improvement to the TimeSeries class so that it is no longer necessary to, +  specify the time period type in the constructor;, +- a new SamplingXYLineRenderer for improving the performance of time series, +  charts with large datasets;, +- the XYSeries/XYSeriesCollection classes now cache the minimum and maximum, +  data values to improve the performance of charts with large datasets;, +- entities are now created for the chart, data area and axes, allowing mouse, +  clicks to be detected for these regions;, +- added a bar alignment factor to the XYBarRenderer class;, +- a new 'errorIndicatorStroke' field for the StatisticalLineAndShapeRenderer , +  and XYErrorRenderer classes;, +- added a new HeatMapDataset interface, DefaultHeatMapDataset implementation,, +  and a HeatMapUtilities class to make it easier to create heat map charts;, +- there is a new flag to allow an XYDataImageAnnotation to be included in the, +  automatic range calculation for the axes;, +- additional attributes in the XYTextAnnotation class;, +- added a sampleFunction2DToSeries() method to the DatasetUtilities class;, +- some changes to the ChartPanel class that help to work around a regression in, +  JRE 1.6.0_10 relating to drawing in XOR mode.  Regarding this final point:, +     * the default value for the useBuffer flag has changed to true, which means, +       that all charts will, by default, be rendered into an off-screen image, +       before being displayed in the ChartPanel;, +     * the zoom rectangle is drawn using XOR mode *only* when the useBuffer, +       flag has been set to false., +  For most usage, this should improve performance (but at the cost of using more, +  memory for each ChartPanel used in your application);, +, +###### Bug Fixes, +, +- 2690293 : Problem with Javascript escape characters;, +- 2617557 : StandardDialScale ignored tickLabelPaint;, +- 2612649 : Stroke selection in plot property editor;, +- 2583891 : SWTGraphics2D.fillPolygon() not implemented;, +- 2564636 : Month constructor ignores Locale;, +- 2502355 : ChartPanel sending multiple events;, +- 2490803 : PeriodAxis.setRange() method doesn't take into account that the axis, +          displays whole periods;, +, +In addition, a bug in the SlidingCategoryDataset class has been fixed, the, +correct outline paint is now used by GradientXYBarPainter, a new method, +has been added to the ImageMapUtilities class to escape special characters, +in Javascript strings to avoid problems with the OverLIB and DynamicDrive, +tooltips, and there are some important fixes in the LogAxis class., +, +This release passes 2110 JUnit tests (0 failures) on JRE 1.6.0_12., +]
