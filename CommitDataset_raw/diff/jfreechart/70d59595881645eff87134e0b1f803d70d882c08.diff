[+++ b/README.md, +Also fixed drawing of alternate grid bands in `SymbolAxis`, the totalWeight , +, +This release contains various bug fixes and minor enhancements to JFreeChart., +, +- PiePlot labelling has been enhanced (new curve options, and more robust bounds checking);, +- The BoxAndWhiskerRenderer now has a maximumBarWidth attribute;, +- the XYStepRenderer has a new stepPoint attribute;, +- The RelativeDateFormat class has new options;, +- There are new dataset classes (SlidingCategoryDataset and SlidingGanttDataset) that permit a subset of categories to be plotted, and allow charts based on these datasets to simulate scrolling.  , +- There is a new ShortTextTitle class., +, +This release passes 1,929 JUnit tests (0 failures) on JRE 1.6.0_03., +, +###### API Adjustments:, +, +- BoxAndWhiskerRenderer - added maximumBarWidth attribute (see patch 1866446);, +- ChartPanel - the zoomPoint attribute has been changed from Point to Point2D;, +- DatasetUtilities - iterateCategoryRangeBounds() is deprecated, the method has been renamed iterateRangeBounds(CategoryDataset) for consistency;, +- DefaultKeyedValue - the constructor now prevents a null key;, +- LogFormat - now has a 'powerLabel' attribute;, +- ShortTextTitle - a new title class;, +- SlidingCategoryDataset - new class;, +- SlidingGanttDataset - new class;, +- TimeSeriesCollection - getSeries(String) changed to getSeries(Comparable);, +- XIntervalSeriesCollection - added series removal methods;, +- YIntervalSeriesCollection - added series removal methods;, +- XYIntervalSeriesCollection - added series removal methods;, +, +`PublicCloneable` is now implemented by a number of classes that didn't previously implement the interface - this should improve the reliability of chart cloning., +, +###### Patches, +, +- 1943021 : Fix for MultiplePiePlot [Brian Cabana];, +- 1925366 : Speed improvement for DatasetUtilities [Rafal Skalny];, +- 1918209 : LogAxis createTickLabel() changed from private to protected [Andrew Mickish];, +- 1914411 : Simplification of plot event notification [Richard West];, +- 1913751 : XYPlot and CategoryPlot addMarker() methods with optional notification [Richard West];, +- 1902418 : Bug fix for LogAxis vertical labels [Andrew Mickish];, +- 1901599 : Fixes for XYTitleAnnotation [Andrew Mickish];, +- 1891849 : New curve option for pie chart label links [Martin Hilpert];, +- 1874890 : Added step point to XYStepRenderer [Ulrich Voigt];, +- 1873328 : Enhancements to RelativeDateFormat [Michael Siemer];, +- 1871902 : PolarPlot now has angleTickUnit attribute [Martin Hoeller];, +- 1868745 : Fix label anchor points on LogAxis [Andrew Mickish];, +- 1866446 : Added maximumBarWidth to BoxAndWhiskerRenderer [Rob Van der Sanden];, +, +###### Bug Fixes, +, +- 1932146 - PeriodAxis.setRange() doesn't notify listeners;, +- 1927239 - Fix calculation of cumulative range;, +- 1926517 - Bugs in data range calculation for combined plots;, +- 1920854 - PiePlot3D labels drawn multiple times;, +- 1897580 - Fix for DefaultIntervalCategoryDataset;, +- 1892419 - Wrong default for minor tick count in LogAxis;, +- 1880114 - VectorRenderer doesn't work for horizontal plot orientation;, +- 1873160 - DialPlot clipping issues;, +- 1868521 - Problem saving charts to JPEG format;, +- 1864222 - Error on TimeSeries createCopy() method;, +, +The DatasetUtilities.sampleFunction2D() has been changed to sample the correct , +number of points - you should check any code that calls this method.  The, +XYBlockRenderer class now generates entities.  Bugs in the removeDomainMarker(), +and removeRangeMarker() methods in the CategoryPlot and XYPlot classes have , +been fixed.  A bug in the TimePeriodValues range calculation has been fixed., +Fixes were applied to the clone() methods in the TaskSeries and , +TaskSeriesCollection classes., +, +###### New Experimental Features, +, +Two new classes CombinedCategoryPlot and CombinedXYPlot have been added to the, +'experimental' source tree - these were contributed by Richard West (see, +patch 1924543).]
