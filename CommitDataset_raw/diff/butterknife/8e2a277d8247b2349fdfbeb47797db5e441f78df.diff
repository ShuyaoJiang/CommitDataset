[+++ b/CHANGELOG.md, +Version 9.0.0-rc1 *(2018-10-10)*, +--------------------------------, +, + * New: Support for AndroidX.

This allows you to reference the generated code directly such that R8/ProGuard optimization can, +   rename both the generated code and your classes. `ButterKnife.bind` and the consumer R8/ProGuard rules, +   remain in the old `butterknife` artifact., + , + * New: Experimental `butterknife-reflect` artifact eliminates the need to run the annotation, +   processor for IDE builds. This artifact is binary compatible with `butterknife` so it can be interchanged, +   depending on how your build is being invoked. See [its README](butterknife-reflect/README.md) for more, +   information. Currently about 90% of functionality is covered. File bugs for anything that does not work., +, +   Note: This artifact requires Java 8. There's no good reason for this except to push the ecosystem to, +   having this be a default.
