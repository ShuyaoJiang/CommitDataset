[+++ b/symbian/ZXingBarcodeReader_tutorial.txt, +== Deploying specificaly to S60 3rd edition ==, +Deploying the project to a S60 3rd edition requires one more step (executed only once)., +After the installation of OpenC/C++ plug-in, the installation files contained in the following folders, +have to be installed to the device:, +, +S60 SDK root folder \ nokia_plugin \ openc \ s60opencsis, +and, +S60 SDK root folder \ nokia_plugin \ opencpp \ s60opencppsis, +, +If this step is not taken, the application will be able to be installed to the device but it WILL NOT RUN!, +When deploying to S60 5th edition, this step is not required because the plug-in is integrated into it already., +, +	------ Optional when deploying to S60 3rd edition ------, +	To integrate the installation files to the project installation file just put the following lines to the .pkg file:, +, +	@"$(EPOCROOT)Epoc32\..\nokia_plugin\openc\s60opencsis\pips_s60_1_6_SS.sis", (0x20013851), +	@"$(EPOCROOT)Epoc32\..\nokia_plugin\openc\s60opencsis\openc_ssl_s60_1_6_SS.sis",(0x200110CB), +	@"$(EPOCROOT)Epoc32\..\nokia_plugin\openc\s60opencsis\openc_glib_s60_1_6_SS.sis",(0x200110CC), +	@"$(EPOCROOT)Epoc32\..\nokia_plugin\opencpp\s60opencppsis\STDCPP_s60_1_6_SS.sis",(0x2000F866), +, +	This will make the final installation file approximately 2.8MB which is not the best solution but this is left to , +	the judgement of the developer whether on not he takes this step., +]
