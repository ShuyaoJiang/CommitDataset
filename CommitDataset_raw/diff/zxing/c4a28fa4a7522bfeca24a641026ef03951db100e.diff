These are just, +// temporary measures, pending the big cleanup., +public final class ReaderException extends java.lang.Throwable {, +    // Do not pass message to Throwable, let it get optimized out, +  }, +, +  // Prevent stack traces from being taken, +  public Throwable fillInStackTrace() {, +    return null;]
