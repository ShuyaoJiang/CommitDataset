[+++ b/CHANGES, +, +0.5 (05 Mar 2008), +  - Improvement in QR Code decoding accuracy on non-JSR-234 phones, +  - Supports "URLTO" data in barcodes., +  - Restructured ParsedReaderResult parsing code to not use so many, +    exceptions, for more efficiency., +  - "TRY_HARDER" decoding hint now supported. Will do more work in some cases, +    to find an image, such as scan for 1D barcodes at a right angle and, +    backwards. Only recommended for non-mobile applications., +  - Result now indicates the format of the decoded barcode with a, +    BarcodeFormat instance, +  - More intelligent handling of POSSIBLE_FORMATS decoding hint, +  - Fixed sub-optimal handling of EAN-13 barcodes which encode a string, +    starting with "0". These are now returned as a full 13-digit string, +    from EAN13Reader, but will continue to be construed as 12-digit UPC-A, +    codes from the MultiFormatReader., +  - A host of small bug fixes, including bug in Version 25 QR Code support, +  - A round of code cleanup and refactoring from IntelliJ inspections, +++ b/CHANGES, +, +0.5 (05 Mar 2008), +  - Improvement in QR Code decoding accuracy on non-JSR-234 phones, +  - Supports "URLTO" data in barcodes., +  - Restructured ParsedReaderResult parsing code to not use so many, +    exceptions, for more efficiency., +  - "TRY_HARDER" decoding hint now supported.
