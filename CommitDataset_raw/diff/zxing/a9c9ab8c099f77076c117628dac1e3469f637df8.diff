However, the code is cirrently maintained, +  - ZXingWidget: a Library that can be included in any iPhone app, +  - ScanTest: a simple test app for ZXingWidget, +, +, +How to include ZXingWidget in a easy and clean way:, +====================================================, +, +  1. Locate the "ZXingWidget.xcodeproj" file under "`zxing/iphone/ZXingWidget/`". Drag ZXingWidget.xcodeproj and, +     drop it onto the root of your Xcode project's "Groups and Files"  sidebar.  A dialog will, +     appear -- make sure "Copy items" is unchecked and "Reference Type" is "Relative to Project", +     before clicking "Add".    , +   , +  2. Now you need to link the ZXingWidget static library to your project.  Click the "ZXingWidget.xcodeproj" , +	 item that has just been added to the sidebar.  Under the "Details" table, you will see a single, +	 item: ZXingWidget.a.  Check the checkbox on the far right of ZXingWidget.a., +  , +  3. Now you need to add ZXingWidget as a dependency of your project, so Xcode compiles it whenever, +	 you compile your project.  Expand the "Targets" section of the sidebar and double-click your, +	 application's target.  Under the "General" tab you will see a "Direct Dependencies" section. , +	 Click the "+" button, select "ZXingWidget", and click "Add Target", +  , +  4. Finally, we need to tell your project where to find the ZXingWidget headers.  Open your, +	 "Project Settings" and go to the "Build" tab. Look for "Header Search Paths" and double-click, +	 it.  Add the relative path from your project's directory to the, +	 "zxing/iphone/ZXingWidget/Classes" directory. Make sure you click the checkbox "relative path" !, + , +  5. You're ready to go. Just #import <ZXingWidgetController.h> from anywhere and it should work !]
