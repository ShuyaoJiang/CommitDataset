[+++ b/CHANGES.md, +### Version 0.6.0 ([Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.netflix.rxjava%22%20AND%20v%3A%220.6.0%22)) ###, +, +* [Issue 154](https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/issues/154) Add OSGi manifest headers, +* [Issue 173](https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/issues/173) Subscription Utilities and Default Implementations, +* [Pull 184](https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/pull/184) Convert 'last' from non-blocking to blocking to match Rx.Net (see [Issue 57](https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/issues/57)), +, +*NOTE:* This is a version bump from 0.5 to 0.6 because [Issue 173](https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/issues/173) and [Pull 184](https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/pull/184) include breaking changes., +, +These changes are being done in the goal of matching the [Rx.Net](https://rx.codeplex.com) implementation so breaking changes will be made prior to 1.0 on 0.x releases if necessary., +, +It was found that the `last()` operator was implemented [incorrectly](https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/issues/57) (non-blocking instead of blocking) so any use of `last()` on version 0.5.x should be changed to use `takeLast(1)`. Since the return type needed to change this could not be done via a deprecation., +, +Also [removed](https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/issues/173) were the `Observable.createSubscription`/`Observable.noOpSubscription` methods which are now on the rx.subscriptions.Subscriptions utility class as `Subscriptions.create`/`Subscriptions.empty`. These methods could have been deprecated rather than removed but since another breaking change was being done they were just cleanly changed as part of the pre-1.0 process., +, +]
