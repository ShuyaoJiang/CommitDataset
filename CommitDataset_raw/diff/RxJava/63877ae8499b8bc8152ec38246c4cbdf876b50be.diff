[+++ b/README.md, +Practically, parallelism in RxJava means running independent flows and merging their results back into a single flow. The operator `flatMap` does this by first mapping each number from 1 to 10 into its own individual `Flowable`, runs them and merges the computed squares., +Sometimes, when an item has become available, one would like to perform some dependent computations on it. This is sometimes called **continuations** and, depending on what should happen and what types are involved, may involve various operators to accomplish., +Dataflows can fail, at which point the error is emitted to the consumer(s). Sometimes though, multiple sources may fail at which point there is a choice whether or not wait for all of them to complete or fail. To indicate this opportunity, many operator names are suffixed with the `DelayError` words (while others feature a `delayError` or `delayErrors` boolean flag in one of their overloads):]
