[+++ b/language-adaptors/rxjava-scala/TODO.md, +, +TODOs for Scala Adapter, +-----------------------, +, +This is a (probably incomplete) list of what still needs to be done in the Scala adaptor:, +, +- [ ] ConnectableObservable: Implement adaptor. Note that it cannot extend Scala Observable, since value classes are final., +- [ ] more methods of BlockingObservable, +- [ ] multicast, publish, replay once we have ConnectableObservable, +- [ ] groupBy and GroupedObservable, +- [ ] mirror complete Java package structure in Scala, +- [ ] convert Java futures to Scala futures, +- [ ] Add methods present in Scala collections library, but not in RxJava, e.g. zipWithIndex, aggregate Ã  la Scala, +- [ ] mergeDelayError, combineLatest, merge, concat, zip: decide if instance method or static or both, decide about arities > 2, +- [ ] naming: switch() or switchOnNext()?, +- [ ] decide where the MovieLib/MovieLibUsage (use Scala code from Java code) example should live and make sure gradle builds it in the right order, +- [ ] Avoid text duplication in scaladoc using templates, add examples, distinction between use case signature and full signature, +- [ ] other small TODOs, +, +]
