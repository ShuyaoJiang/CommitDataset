[+++ b/DESIGN.md, +... under discussion ... (related to Observable/Flowable debate), +A "hot", push-based data source that allows a producer to emit events to it and consumers to subscribe to events in a multicast manner. It is "hot" because consumers subscribing to it does not cause side-effects, or affect the data flow in any way. It is push-based and reactive because the producer is fully in charge. , +Relation to Reactive Streams, +, +- It can not implement Reactive Streams `Publisher` unless it is created with a default flow control strategy. , +- It can not implement `Processor` since a `Processor` must compose `request(n)` which can not be done with multicasting or pure push. , +, +Flow control support:, +, +- buffering, sampling, throttling, windowing, dropping, etc, +- temporal and count-based strategies, +- It does not support pull-based consumer-driven flow control.]
