[+++ b/README.md, +import io.reactivex.functions.Consumer;, +, +import io.reactivex.schedulers.Schedulers;, +, +RxJava operators don't work with `Thread`s or `ExecutorService`s directly but with so called `Scheduler`s that abstract away sources of concurrency behind an uniform API. RxJava 2 features several standard schedulers accessible via `Schedulers` utility class. These are available on all JVM platforms but some specific platforms, such as Android, have their own typical `Scheduler`s defined: `AndroidSchedulers.mainThread()`, `SwingScheduler.instance()` or `JavaFXSchedulers.gui()`.]
