Because `rx.lang.scala.Observable[T]` is an opaque type in Scala,, +the Scala programmer only sees the Scala-friendly operators., +However, in the current the illusion of interop is quickly lost when going beyond this simple example., +For example but type `Notification[T]` and `Scheduler[T]` are defined using wrappers,, +and hence they are not compatible with `Notification<T>` respectively `Scheduler<T>`., +For instance, when materializing an `Observable[T]` in Scala to an `Observable[Notification[T]]`,, +we lost the seamless interop with `Observable<Notification<T>>` on the Java side., +However, the real problems with seamless interop show up when we try to creating bindings for other Rx types.]
