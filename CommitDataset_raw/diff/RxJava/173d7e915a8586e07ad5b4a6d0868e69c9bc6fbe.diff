[+++ b/README.md, +Patch 1.x.y increments (such as 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1, 1.3.1 -> 1.3.2, etc) will occur for bug fixes and trivial functionality (like adding a method overload). New functionality marked with an [`@Beta`][beta source link] or [`@Experimental`][experimental source link] annotation can also be added in patch releases to allow rapid exploration and iteration of unstable new functionality. , +APIs marked with the [`@Beta`][beta source link] annotation at the class or method level are subject to change. They can be modified in any way, or even removed, at any time. If your code is a library itself (i.e. it is used on the CLASSPATH of users outside your own control), you should not use beta APIs, unless you repackage them (e.g. using ProGuard, shading, etc)., +APIs marked with the [`@Experimental`][experimental source link] annotation at the class or method level will almost certainly change. They can be modified in any way, or even removed, at any time. You should not use or rely on them in any production code. They are purely to allow broad testing and feedback. , +, +[beta source link]: https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/blob/master/src/main/java/rx/annotations/Beta.java, +[experimental source link]: https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/blob/master/src/main/java/rx/annotations/Experimental.java]
