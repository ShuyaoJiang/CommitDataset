[+++ b/CHANGES.md, +This version adds to the static typing changes in 0.11 and adds covariant/contravariant typing via super/extends generics., +, +Additional cleanup was done, particularly related to `BlockingObservable`. Also the `window` operator was added., +, +The largest breaking change is that `Observable.create` now accepts an `OnSubscribeFunc` rather than a `Func1`., +, +This means that instead of this:, +, +```java, +public static <T> Observable<T> create(Func1<? super Observer<? super T>, ? extends Subscription> func), +```, +, +it is now:, +, +```java, +public static <T> Observable<T> create(OnSubscribeFunc<T> func), +```, +, +This was done to simplify the usage of `Observable.create` which was already verbose but made far worse by the `? super` generics., +, +For example, instead of writing this:, +, +```java, +Observable.create(new Func1<Observer<? super SomeType>, Subscription>() {, +   /// body here, +}, +```, +, +it is now written as:, +, +```java, +Observable.create(new OnSubscribeFunc<SomeType>() {, +   /// body here, +}, +```, +]
