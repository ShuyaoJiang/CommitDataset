[+++ b/README.md, +RxJava is a Java VM implementation of [Reactive Extensions](://reactivex.io): a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences., +It extends the [observer pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) to support sequences of data/events and adds operators that allow you to compose sequences together declaratively while abstracting away concerns about things like low-level threading, synchronization, thread-safety and concurrent data structures., +- Zero Dependencies, +- < 700KB Jar, +- Java 6+ & [Android](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid) 2.3+, +- Java 8 lambda support, +- Polyglot ([Scala](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxScala), [Groovy](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxGroovy), [Clojure](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxClojure) and [Kotlin](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxKotlin)), +- Non-opinionated about source of concurrency (threads, pools, event loops, fibers, actors, etc), +- Async or synchronous execution, +- Virtual time and schedulers for parameterized concurrency, +Learn more about RxJava on the <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki">Wiki Home</a>.]
