In particular this release focuses on fleshing out the bindings for the `Subject` and `Scheduler`, +types, as well as aligning the constructor functions for `Observable` with those in the RxJava., +, +Expect to see ongoing additions to make the Scala binding match the equivalent underlying Java API,, +as well as minor changes in the existing API as we keep fine-tuning the experience on our way to a V1.0 release., +, +Observer, +--------, +, +In this release we have made the `asJavaObserver` property in `Observable[T]`as well the the factory method in the, +companion object that takes an `rx.Observer` private to the Scala bindings package, thus properly hiding irrelevant, +implementation details from the user-facing API. The `Observer[T]` trait now looks like a clean, native Scala type:, +, +```scala, +trait Observer[-T] {, +  def onNext(value: T): Unit, +  def onError(error: Throwable): Unit, +  def onCompleted(): Unit, +}, +, +object Observer {...}, +```, +, +To create an instance of a specific `Observer`, say  `Observer[SensorEvent]` in user code, you can create a new instance, +of the `Observer` trait by implementing any of the methods that you care about:, +```scala, +   val printObserver = new Observer[SensorEvent] {, +      override def onNext(value: SensorEvent): Unit = {...value.toString...}, +   }, +```, + or you can use one of the overloads of the companion `Observer` object by passing in implementations of the `onNext`,, + `onError` or `onCompleted` methods., +, +Note that typically you do not need to create an `Observer` since all of the methods that accept an `Observer[T]`, +(for instance `subscribe`) usually come with overloads that accept the individual methods, +`onNext`, `onError`, and `onCompleted` and will automatically create an `Observer` for you under the covers., +, +While *technically* it is a breaking change make the `asJavaObserver` property private, you should probably not have, +touched `asJavaObserver` in the first place. If you really feel you need to access the underlying `rx.Observer`, +call `toJava`., +, +Observable, +----------, +, +Just like for `Observer`, the `Observable` trait now also hides its `asJavaObservable` property and makes the constructor, +function in the companion object that takes an `rx.Observable` private (but leaves the companion object itself public)., +Again, while *technically* this is a breaking change, this should not have any influence on user code., +, +```scala, +trait Observable[+T] {, +    def subscribe(observer: Observer[T]): Subscription = {...}, +    def apply(observer: Observer[T]): Subscription = {...}, +    ..., +}, +object Observable {, +   def create[T](func: Observer[T] => Subscription): Observable[T] = {...}, +   ..., +}, +```, +, +The major changes in `Observable` are wrt to the factory methods where too libral use of overloading of the `apply`, +method hindered type inference and made Scala code look unnecessarily different than that in other language bindings., +All factory methods now have their own name corresponding to the Java and .NET operators, +(plus overloads that take a `Scheduler`)., +, +* `def from[T](future: Future[T]): Observable[T]`,, +* `def from[T](iterable: Iterable[T]): Observable[T]`,, +* `def error[T](exception: Throwable): Observable[T]`,, +* `def empty[T]: Observable[T]`,, +* `def items[T](items: T*): Observable[T],, +* Extension method on `toObservable: Observable[T]` on `List[T]`., +, +In the *pre-release* of this version, we expose both `apply` and `create` for the mother of all creation functions., +We would like to solicit feedback which of these two names is preferred, +(or both, but there is a high probability that only one will be chosen)., +, +* `def apply[T](subscribe: Observer[T]=>Subscription): Observable[T]`, +* `def create[T](subscribe: Observer[T] => Subscription): Observable[T]`, +, +Subject, +-------, +, +The `Subject` trait now also hides the underlying Java `asJavaSubject: rx.subjects.Subject[_ >: T, _<: T]`, +and takes only a single *invariant* type parameter `T`. all existing implementations of `Subject` are parametrized, +by a single type, and this reflects that reality.]
