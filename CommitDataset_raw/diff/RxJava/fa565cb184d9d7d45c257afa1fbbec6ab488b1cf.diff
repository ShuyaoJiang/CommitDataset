[+++ b/CHANGES.md, +, +### Version 2.0.0-RC1 - August 25, 2016 ([Maven](http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Cio.reactivex.rxjava2%7Crxjava%7C2.0.0-RC1%7C)), +, +RxJava 2.0 has been rewritten from scratch to be more performant, lower overhead (memory and cpu) and to natively implement the Reactive-Streams specification in its new `Flowable` type. The library still supports Java 6+ and is considered a **4th generation reactive library**., +, +There have been hundreds of PRs and large amounts of changes compared to the 1.x version. The two are binary-incompatible but their distinct maven coordinates (`io.reactivex.rxjava2:rxjava:2.0.0-RC1`) allow them to co-exist. You can use the [rxjava2-interop](https://github.com/akarnokd/RxJava2Interop) library to convert between 1.x and 2.x types., +, +Please refer to the [wiki page about the differences between the two major versions](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki/What's-different-in-2.0)., +, +Converting the companion libraries is an ongoing effort. For now, see the [rxjava2-extensions](https://github.com/akarnokd/RxJava2Extensions) project that contains the port of the [RxJavaMath](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJavaMath) features. Note that most companion libraries of RxJava are currently not set up properly for release (the signing keys are missing from the CI release process) and is unknown if and when they will have their own 2.x release branch., +, +I'd like to thank for the contributions of the following community members (in LIFO commit-merge order):, +, +@davidmoten, @JakeWharton, @vanniktech, @dimitar-asenov, @artem-zinnatullin, @bobvanderlinden, @DmitriyZaitsev, @zsxwing, @bcorne, @stevegury, @benjchristensen, @stealthcode, @adam-arold and @abersnaze., +, +A special thanks goes out to @smaldini, [Project-Reactor](https://github.com/reactor/reactor-core) lead at Pivotal.
