By default, Glide includes an implementation for fetching images over http based on Google's Volley project for fast, parallelized network operations on Android., +Glide's primary focus is on making scrolling any kind of a list of images as smooth and fast as possible, but Glide is also effective for almost any case where you need to fetch, resize, and display a remote image., +You can download a .jar from GitHub's release page for the Glide project. The wiki also has pages on a variety of topics and the javadocs for version 2.0+ will also be available via a link there as well., +    Glide.load("http://goo.gl/h8qOq7").into(imageView);, +    Glide.load(url), +Glide has been in use at Bump for about six months in two of our Android apps at version 1.0. Version 2.0 is the first public release with a stable api. Comments/bugs/questions/pull requests welcome!]
