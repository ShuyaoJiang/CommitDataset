[+++ b/library/src/main/java/com/bumptech/glide/load/resource/bitmap/BitmapTransformation.java, +     *   The provided Bitmap, toTransform, should not be recycled or returned to the pool. Glide will automatically, +     *   recycle and/or reuse toTransform if the transformation returns a different Bitmap. Similarly implementations, +     *   should never recycle or return Bitmaps that are returned as the result of this method. Recycling or returning, +     *   the provided and/or the returned Bitmap to the pool will lead to a variety of runtime exceptions and drawing, +     *   errors. See #408 for an example. If the implementation obtains and discards intermediate Bitmaps, they may, +     *   safely be returned to the BitmapPool and/or recycled., +     * </p>, +     *, +     * <p>]
