[+++ b/docs/plugins/repository-s3.asciidoc, +The plugin provides a repository type named `s3` which may be used when creating a repository., +The repository defaults to using, +credentials for authentication. The only mandatory setting is the bucket name:, +    "bucket": "my_bucket", +  }, +}, +----, +// CONSOLE, +// TEST[skip:we don't have s3 setup while testing this], +, +, +[[repository-s3-client]], +==== Client Settings, +, +The client used to connect to S3 has a number of settings available. Client setting names are of, +the form `s3.client.CLIENT_NAME.SETTING_NAME` and specified inside `elasticsearch.yml`.  The, +default client name looked up by an s3 repository is called `default`, but can be customized, +with the repository setting `client`. For example:, +, +[source,js], +----, +PUT _snapshot/my_s3_repository, +{, +  "type": "s3",, +  "settings": {, +    "bucket": "my_bucket",, +    "client": "my_alternate_client", +  }, +}, +----, +// CONSOLE, +// TEST[skip:we don't have s3 setup while testing this], +, +Some settings are sensitive and must be stored in the {ref}/secure-settings.html[elasticsearch keystore]., +For example, to use explicit AWS access keys:, +, +[source,sh], +----, +bin/elasticsearch-keystore add s3.client.default.access_key, +bin/elasticsearch-keystore add s3.client.default.secret_key, +----, +, +The following are the available client settings. Those that must be stored in the keystore, +are marked as `Secure`., +, +`access_key`::, +, +    An s3 access key. The `secret_key` setting must also be specified. (Secure), +, +`secret_key`::, +, +    An s3 secret key. The `access_key` setting must also be specified. (Secure), +, +`endpoint`::, +, +    The s3 service endpoint to connect to. This will be automatically, +    figured out by the s3 client based on the bucket location, but, +    can be specified explicitly. See http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region., +, +`protocol`::, +, +    The protocol to use to connect to s3. Valid values are either `http`, +    or `https`. Defaults to `https`. , +, +`proxy.host`::, +, +    The host name of a proxy to connect to s3 through., +, +`proxy.port`::, +, +    The port of a proxy to connect to s3 through., +, +`proxy.username`::, +, +    The username to connect to the `proxy.host` with. (Secure)    , +, +`proxy.password`::, +, +    The password to connect to the `proxy.host` with. (Secure)    , +, +`read_timeout`::, +, +    The socket timeout for connecting to s3. The value should specify the unit. For example,, +    a value of `5s` specifies a 5 second timeout. The default value is 50 seconds., +, +`max_retries`::, +, +    The number of retries to use when an s3 request fails. The default value is 3., +, +`use_throttle_retries`::, +, +    Whether retries should be throttled (ie use backoff). Must be `true` or `false`. Defaults to `false`., +, +[[repository-s3-repository]], +==== Repository Settings, +, +The `s3` repository type supports a number of settings to customize how data is stored in S3., +These can be specified when creating the repository.
