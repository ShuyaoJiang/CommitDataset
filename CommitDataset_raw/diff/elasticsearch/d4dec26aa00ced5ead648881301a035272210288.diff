[+++ b/docs/reference/modules/node.asciidoc, +The <<data-path,data path>> can be shared by multiple nodes, even by nodes from different, +clusters. This is very useful for testing failover and different configurations on your development, +machine. In production, however, it is recommended to run only one node of Elasticsearch per server., +By default, Elasticsearch is configured to prevent more than one node from sharing the same data, +path. To allow for more than one node (e.g., on your development machine), use the setting, +`node.max_local_storage_nodes` and set this to a positve integer larger than one., +WARNING: Never run different node types (i.e. master, data) from the same data directory. This can, +lead to unexpected data loss.]
