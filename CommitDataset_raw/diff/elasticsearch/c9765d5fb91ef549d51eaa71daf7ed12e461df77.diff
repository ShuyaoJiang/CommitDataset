[+++ b/docs/reference/modules/snapshots.asciidoc, +A snapshot is a backup taken from a running Elasticsearch cluster. You can take, +a snapshot of individual indices or of the entire cluster and store it in a, +repository on a shared filesystem, and there are plugins that support remote, +repositories on S3, HDFS, Azure, Google Cloud Storage and more., +, +Snapshots are taken incrementally. This means that when creating a snapshot of, +an index Elasticsearch will avoid copying any data that is already stored in, +the repository as part of an earlier snapshot of the same index. Therefore it, +can be efficient to take snapshots of your cluster quite frequently., +, +Snapshots can be restored into a running cluster via the restore API. When, +restoring an index it is possible to alter the name of the restored index as, +well as some of its settings, allowing a great deal of flexibility in how the, +snapshot and restore functionality can be used., +, +WARNING: It is not possible to back up an Elasticsearch cluster simply by, +taking a copy of the data directories of all of its nodes. Elasticsearch may be, +making changes to the contents of its data directories while it is running, and, +this means that copying its data directories cannot be expected to capture a, +consistent picture of their contents. Attempts to restore a cluster from such a, +backup may fail, reporting corruption and/or missing files, or may appear to, +have succeeded having silently lost some of its data. The only reliable way to, +back up a cluster is by using the snapshot and restore functionality., +, +[float], +=== Version compatibility, +, +A snapshot contains a copy of the on-disk data structures that make up an, +index. This means that snapshots can only be restored to versions of, +Elasticsearch that can read the indices:, +Conversely, snapshots of indices created in 1.x **cannot** be restored to 5.x, +or 6.x, and snapshots of indices created in 2.x **cannot** be restored to 6.x., +Each snapshot can contain indices created in various versions of Elasticsearch,, +and when restoring a snapshot it must be possible to restore all of the indices, +into the target cluster. If any indices in a snapshot were created in an, +source enabled. Retrieving and reindexing the data can take significantly, +longer than simply restoring a snapshot. If you have a large amount of data, we]
