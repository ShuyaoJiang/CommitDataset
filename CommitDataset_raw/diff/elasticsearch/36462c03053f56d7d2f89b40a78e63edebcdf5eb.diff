[+++ b/docs/reference/getting-started.asciidoc, +A cluster is a collection of one or more nodes (servers) that together holds your entire data and provides federated indexing and search capabilities across all nodes. A cluster is identified by a unique name which by default is "elasticsearch". This name is important because a node can only be part of a cluster if the node is set up to join the cluster by its name. It is good practice to explicitly set the cluster name in production, but it is fine to use the default for testing/development purposes.]
