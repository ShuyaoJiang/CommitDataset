[+++ b/GRADLE.CHEATSHEET.asciidoc, +To compile `x-plugins`, you must clone the Elasticsearch repository into the same parent directory. For example:, +, +[source,bash], +----, +$ mkdir elastic, +$ cd elastic, +$ git clone git@github.com:elastic/elasticsearch.git, +$ git clone git@github.com:elastic/x-plugins.git, +----, +, +Once cloned, any command should be issused from the **elasticsearch** directory., +, +[source,bash], +----, +$ cd elasticsearch, +$ gradle clean test check <1>, +----, +<1> This will run the `clean` task, `test` task, and then the `check` task on _every_ project that has it. However, `check` requires that `test` be run, so it won't _rerun_ `test`. `clean` is unnecessary here, but people often use it anyway., +, +| `clean`                     | `clean`     | Delete anything that exists already. You do _not_ generally need to run `clean` with Gradle for any task that _Gradle_ manages the inputs/outputs (in other words, it knows when it needs to rebuild versus reuse)., +| `verify`                    | `check`     | Run all tests, plus extra checks (e.g., line length)., +| `verify -Dskip.unit.tests`  | `integTest` | Run only integration tests., +| `install -DskipTests`       | `install`   | Build jars and place them into the local _Maven_ repository (yes, even with Gradle)., ++, +This should be unnecessary with the unified build!, +|====]
