[+++ b/docs/reference/cluster/update-settings.asciidoc, +It's best to set all cluster-wide settings with the `settings` API and use the, +`elasticsearch.yml` file only for local configurations. This way you can be sure that, +the setting is the same on all nodes. If, on the other hand, you define different, +settings on different nodes by accident using the configuration file, it is very, +difficult to notice these discrepancies.]
