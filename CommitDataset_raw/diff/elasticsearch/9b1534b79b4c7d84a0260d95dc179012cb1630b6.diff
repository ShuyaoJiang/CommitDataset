[+++ b/docs/reference/migration/migrate_7_0/mappings.asciidoc, +==== Changed default `geo_shape` indexing strategy, +them into individual grid cells. To index using legacy prefix trees the `tree` parameter, +must be explicitly set to one of `quadtree` or `geohash`. Note that these strategies are, +now deprecated and will be removed in a future version., +, +IMPORTANT NOTE: If using timed index creation from templates, the `geo_shape` mapping, +should also be changed in the template to explicitly define `tree` to one of `geohash`, +or `quadtree`. This will ensure compatibility with previously created indexes.]
