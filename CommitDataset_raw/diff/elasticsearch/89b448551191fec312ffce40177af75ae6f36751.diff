[+++ b/docs/reference/how-to/search-speed.asciidoc, +=== Search as few fields as possible, +, +The more fields a <<query-dsl-query-string-query,`query_string`>> or, +<<query-dsl-multi-match-query,`multi_match`>> query targets, the slower it is., +A common technique to improve search speed over multiple fields is to copy, +their values into a single field at index time, and then use this field at, +search time. This can be automated with the <<copy-to,`copy-to`>> directive of, +mappings without having to change the source of documents. Here is an example, +of an index containing movies that optimizes queries that search over both the, +name and the plot of the movie by indexing both values into the `name_and_plot`, +field., +, +[source,js], +--------------------------------------------------, +PUT movies, +{, +  "mappings": {, +    "_doc": {, +      "properties": {, +        "name_and_plot": {, +          "type": "text", +        },, +        "name": {, +          "type": "text",, +          "copy_to": "name_and_plot", +        },, +        "plot": {, +          "type": "text",, +          "copy_to": "name_and_plot", +        }, +      }, +    }, +  }, +}, +--------------------------------------------------, +// CONSOLE, +, +[float]]
