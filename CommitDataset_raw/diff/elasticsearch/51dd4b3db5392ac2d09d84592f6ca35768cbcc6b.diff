[+++ b/docs/reference/setup/as-a-service.asciidoc, +Users running Debian 8 or Ubuntu 14 or later may require configuration of systemd instead of `update-rc.d`. In those cases, please refer to the <<using-systemd>> section., +, +[[using-systemd]], +Distributions like Debian Jessie, Ubuntu 14, and many of the SUSE derivitives do not use the `chkconfig` tool to register services, but rather `systemd` and its command `/bin/systemctl` to start and stop services (at least in newer versions, otherwise use the `chkconfig` commands above). The configuration file is also placed at `/etc/sysconfig/elasticsearch` if the system is rpm based and `/etc/default/elasticsearch` if it is deb. After installing the RPM, you have to change the systemd configuration and then start up elasticsearch]
