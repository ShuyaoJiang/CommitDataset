When you consider your own data, however, it's important to, +take a moment and think about where the {xpack} {ml} features will be most, +impactful., +The first consideration is that it must be time series data. The {ml} features, +are designed to model and detect anomalies in time series data., +to monitor and act on when anomalous behavior occurs. You might even have {kib}, +The final consideration is where the data is located. This tutorial assumes that, +your data is stored in {es}. It guides you through the steps required to create, +a _data feed_ that passes data to a job. If your own data is outside of {es},, +analysis is still possible by using a post data API., +IMPORTANT: If you want to create {ml} jobs in {kib}, you must use data feeds., +That is to say, you must store your input data in {es}. When you create, +a job, you select an existing index pattern and {kib} configures the data feed, +In this step we will upload some sample data to {es}. This is standard, +{es} functionality, and is needed to set the stage for using {ml}., +particular time. If your data is stored in {es}, you can generate, +summarizing data this way is that {es} automatically distributes, +this tutorial, however, these summary values are stored in {es},, +You can then use the {es} `bulk` API to load the data set. The, +. Open {kib} in your web browser and log in. If you are running {kib}, +This data set can now be analyzed in {ml} jobs in {kib}., +NOTE: This tutorial uses {kib} to create jobs and view results, but you can, +To work with jobs in {kib}:, +. Open {kib} in your web browser and log in. If you are running {kib} locally,, +go to `http://localhost:5601/`., +{kib}. In this tutorial, the goal is to detect anomalies in the total requests, +To create a single metric job in {kib}:, +want to perform the analysis, the frequency of the input data, the duration of, +typical anomalies and the frequency at which alerting is required., +picker in the {kib} toolbar. Since the sample data spans a period of time, +by using the advanced options in {kib}, you can specify a `model_memory_limit`., +stopped::: The data feed is stopped and will not receive data until it is, +re-started., +If you want to retrieve more data from {es} and the data feed is, +The date picker defaults to the latest timestamp of processed data. Be careful, +not to leave any gaps in the analysis, otherwise you might miss anomalies., +TIP: If your data is being loaded continuously, you can continue running the job, +in real time. For this, start your data feed and select **No end time**., +, +Result records for each anomaly are stored in `.ml-anomalies-*` indices in {es}., +By default, the name of the index where {ml} results are stored is labelled, +`shared`, which corresponds to the `.ml-anomalies-shared` index., +You can use the **Anomaly Explorer** or the **Single Metric Viewer** in {kib} to, +view the analysis results., +  There is an overall swim lane that shows the overall score for the job, and, +  anomaly details are displayed alongside the original source data (where, +  applicable)., +  This view contains a chart that represents the actual and expected values over, +  time. This is only available for jobs that analyze a single time series and, +  where `model_plot_config` is enabled. As in the **Anomaly Explorer**, anomalous, +  data points are shown in different colors depending on their score., +By default when you view the results for a single metric job, the, +**Single Metric Viewer** opens:, +The blue line in the chart represents the actual data values. The shaded blue, +area represents the bounds for the expected values. The area between the upper, +and lower bounds are the most likely values for the model. If a value is outside, +of this area then it can be said to be anomalous., +Slide the time selector to a section of the time series that contains a red, +anomaly data point. If you hover over the point, you can see more information, +about that data point. You can also see details in the **Anomalies** section, +of the viewer. For example:, +You can see the same information in a different format by using the, +**Anomaly Explorer**:, +Click one of the red blocks in the swim lane to see details about the anomalies, +that occurred in that time interval.
