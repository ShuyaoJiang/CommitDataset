[+++ b/docs/reference/modules/scripting.asciidoc, +=== Disabling dynamic scripts, +, +We recommend running Elasticsearch behind an application or proxy,, +which protects Elasticsearch from the outside world. If users are, +allowed to run dynamic scripts (even in a search request), then they, +have the same access to your box as the user that Elasticsearch is, +running as., +, +First, you should not run Elasticsearch as the `root` user, as this, +would allow a script to access or do *anything* on your server, without, +limitations. Second, you should not expose Elasticsearch directly to, +users, but instead have a proxy application inbetween.  If you *do*, +intend to expose Elasticsearch directly to your users, then you have, +to decide whether you trust them enough to run scripts on your box or, +not. If not, then even if you have a proxy which only allows `GET`, +requests, you should disable dynamic scripting by adding the following, +setting to the `config/elasticsearch.yml` file on every node:, +, +[source,yaml], +-----------------------------------, +script.disable_dynamic: true, +-----------------------------------, +, +This will still allow execution of named scripts provided in the config, or, +_native_ Java scripts registered through plugins, however it will prevent, +users from running arbitrary scripts via the API., +, +[float]]
