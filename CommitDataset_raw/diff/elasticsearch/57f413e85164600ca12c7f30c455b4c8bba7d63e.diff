[+++ b/docs/java-api/docs/update-by-query.asciidoc, +The `UpdateByQueryRequestBuilder` API supports filtering the updated documents,, +limiting the total number of documents to update, and updating documents, +`UpdateByQueryRequestBuilder` also enables direct access to the query used, +to select the documents. You can use this access to change the default scroll size or, +In addition to changing the `_source` field for the document, you can use a, +script to change the action, similar to the Update API:, +As in the <<docs-update,Update API>>, you can set the value of `ctx.op` to change the, +operation that executes:, +Set `ctx.op = "noop"` if your script doesn't make any, +changes. The `updateByQuery` operaton then omits that document from the updates., +This behavior increments the `noop` counter in the, +Setting `ctx.op` to any other value generates an error. Setting any, +other field in `ctx` generates an error., +You can also perform these operations on multiple indices and types at once, similar to the search API:, +If you provide a `routing` value then the process copies the routing value to the scroll query,, +Use the `list tasks` API to find the value of `taskId`., +Cancelling a request is typically a very fast process but can take up to a few seconds., +The task status API continues to list the task until the cancellation is complete., +Use the `_rethrottle` API to change the value of `requests_per_second` on a running update:, +Use the `list tasks` API to find the value of `taskId`., +As with the `updateByQuery` API, the value of `requests_per_second`, +can be any positive float value to set the level of the throttle, or `Float.POSITIVE_INFINITY` to disable throttling., +A value of `requests_per_second` that speeds up the process takes, +effect immediately. `requests_per_second` values that slow the query take effect, +after completing the current batch in order to prevent scroll timeouts.]
