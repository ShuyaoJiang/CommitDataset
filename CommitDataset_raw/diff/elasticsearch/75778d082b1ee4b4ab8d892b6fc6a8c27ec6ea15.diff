This can be useful if a single field need to be, +used in different ways. For example a single field is to be used for both, +free text search and sorting., +, +[source,js], +--------------------------------------------------, +{, +  "tweet" : {, +    "properties" : {, +      "name" : {, +        "type" : "string",, +        "index" : "analyzed",, +        "fields" : {, +          "raw" : {"type" : "string", "index" : "not_analyzed"}, +        }, +      }, +    }, +  }, +}, +--------------------------------------------------, +, +In the above example the field name gets processed twice. The first time is gets, +processed as an analyzed string and this version is accessible under the field name, +`name`, this is the main field and is in fact just like any other field. The second time, +its get processed as a not analyzed string and is accessible under the name `name.raw`., +, +[float], +==== Accessing Fields, +, +The multi fields defined in the `fields` are prefixed with the, +name of the main field and can be accessed by their full path using the, +navigation notation: `name.raw`, or using the typed navigation notation, +`tweet.name.raw`. The `path` option allows to control how fields are accessed., +If the `path` option is set to `full`, then the full path of the main field, +is prefixed, but if the `path` option is set to `just_name` the actual, +multi field name without any prefix is used. The default value for, +the `path` option is `full`., +, +The `just_name` setting, among other things, allows indexing content of multiple, +fields under the same name. In the example below the content of both fields, +`first_name` and `last_name` can be accessed by using `any_name` or `tweet.any_name`., +, +[source,js], +--------------------------------------------------, +{, +  "tweet" : {, +    "properties": {, +      "first_name": {, +        "type": "string",, +        "index": "analyzed",, +        "path": "just_name",, +        "fields": {, +          "any_name": {"type": "string","index": "analyzed"}, +        }, +      },, +      "last_name": {, +        "type": "string",, +        "index": "analyzed",, +        "path": "just_name",, +        "fields": {, +          "any_name": {"type": "string","index": "analyzed"}, +        }, +      }, +    }, +  }, +}, +--------------------------------------------------, +, +[float], +==== Include in All, +, +The `include_in_all` setting is ignored on any field that is defined in, +the `fields` options. Setting the `include_in_all` only makes sense on, +the main field, since the raw field value to copied to the `_all` field,, +the tokens aren't copied., +, +[float], +==== Updating a field, +, +In the essence a field can't be updated. However multi fields can be, +added to existing fields. This allows for example to have a different, +`index_analyzer` configuration in addition to the already configured, +`index_analyzer` configuration specified in the main and other multi fields., +, +Also the new multi field will only be applied on document that have been, +added after the multi field has been added and in fact the new multi field, +doesn't exist in existing documents.]
