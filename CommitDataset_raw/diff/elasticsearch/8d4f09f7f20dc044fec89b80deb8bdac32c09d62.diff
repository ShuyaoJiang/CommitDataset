Defaults to, +`5s` in the transport client and `-1` (disabled) elsewhere. It is preferable to, +correctly configure TCP keep-alives instead of using this feature, because TCP, +keep-alives apply to all kinds of long-lived connection and not just to, +transport connections., +==== Long-lived idle connections, +, +Elasticsearch opens a number of long-lived TCP connections between each pair of, +nodes in the cluster, and some of these connections may be idle for an extended, +period of time. Nonetheless, Elasticsearch requires these connections to remain, +open, and it can disrupt the operation of the cluster if any inter-node, +connections are closed by an external influence such as a firewall. It is, +important to configure your network to preserve long-lived idle connections, +between Elasticsearch nodes, for instance by leaving `tcp_keep_alive` enabled, +and ensuring that the keepalive interval is shorter than any timeout that might, +cause idle connections to be closed, or by setting `transport.ping_schedule` if, +keepalives cannot be configured., +, +[float]]
