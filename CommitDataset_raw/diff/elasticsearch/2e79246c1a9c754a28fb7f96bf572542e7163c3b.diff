With this information, +at hand, it is able to perform read and write operations against the nodes in, +all clusters as if they were local., +, +The `elasticsearch.yml` config file for a tribe node just needs to list the, +clusters that should be joined, for instance:, +, +[source,yaml], +--------------------------------, +tribe:, +    t1: <1>, +        cluster.name:   cluster_one, +    t2: <1>, +        cluster.name:   cluster_two, +--------------------------------, +<1> `t1` and `t2` are aribitrary names representing the connection to each, +    cluster., +, +The example above configures connections to two clusters, name `t1` and `t2`, +respectively.  The tribe node will create a <<modules-node,node client>> to, +connect each cluster using <<multicast,multicast discovery>> by default. Any, +other settings for the connection can be configured under `tribe.{name}`, just, +like the `cluster.name` in the example., +, +The merged global cluster state means that almost all operations work in the, +same way as a single cluster: distributed search, suggest, percolation,, +indexing, etc., +, +However, there are a few exceptions:, +, +* The merged view cannot handle indices with the same name in multiple, +  clusters. It will pick one of them and discard the other., +, +* Master level read operations (eg <<cluster-state>>, <<cluster-health>>), +  need to have the `local` flag set to `true` as the tribe node does not, +  have a single master node., +, +* Master level write operations (eg <<indices-create-index>>) are not, +  allowed. These should be performed on a single cluster., +, +The tribe node can be configured to block all write operations and all, +metadata operations with:, +, +[source,yaml], +--------------------------------, +tribe:, +    blocks:, +        write:    true, +        metadata: true, +--------------------------------, +]
