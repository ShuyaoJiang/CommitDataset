The resulting grid can be sparse and only, +contains cells that have matching data. Each cell corresponds to a, +https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiled_web_map[map tile] as used by many online map, +sites. Each cell is labeled using a "{zoom}/{x}/{y}" format, where zoom is equal, +to the user-specified precision., +, +* High precision keys have a larger range for x and y, and represent tiles that, +cover only a small area., +* Low precision keys have a smaller range for x and y, and represent tiles that, +each cover a large area., +, +See https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Zoom_levels[Zoom level documentation], +on how precision (zoom) correlates to size on the ground. Precision for this, +aggregation can be between 0 and 29, inclusive., +, +WARNING: The highest-precision geotile of length 29 produces cells that cover, +less than a 10cm by 10cm of land and so high-precision requests can be very, +costly in terms of RAM and result sizes. Please see the example below on how, +to first filter the aggregation to a smaller geographic area before requesting, +high-levels of detail., +, +The specified field must be of type `geo_point` (which can only be set, +explicitly in the mappings) and it can also hold an array of `geo_point`, +fields, in which case all points will be taken into account during aggregation., +, +, +==== Simple low-precision request, +, +[source,js], +--------------------------------------------------, +PUT /museums, +{, +    "mappings": {, +          "properties": {, +              "location": {, +                  "type": "geo_point", +              }, +          }, +    }, +}, +, +POST /museums/_bulk?refresh, +{"index":{"_id":1}}, +{"location": "52.374081,4.912350", "name": "NEMO Science Museum"}, +{"index":{"_id":2}}, +{"location": "52.369219,4.901618", "name": "Museum Het Rembrandthuis"}, +{"index":{"_id":3}}, +{"location": "52.371667,4.914722", "name": "Nederlands Scheepvaartmuseum"}, +{"index":{"_id":4}}, +{"location": "51.222900,4.405200", "name": "Letterenhuis"}, +{"index":{"_id":5}}, +{"location": "48.861111,2.336389", "name": "Musée du Louvre"}, +{"index":{"_id":6}}, +{"location": "48.860000,2.327000", "name": "Musée d'Orsay"}, +, +POST /museums/_search?size=0, +{, +    "aggregations" : {, +        "large-grid" : {, +            "geotile_grid" : {, +                "field" : "location",, +                "precision" : 8, +            }, +        }, +    }, +}, +--------------------------------------------------, +// CONSOLE, +, +Response:, +, +[source,js], +--------------------------------------------------, +{, +    ..., +    "aggregations": {, +        "large-grid": {, +            "buckets": [, +                {, +                  "key" : "8/131/84",, +                  "doc_count" : 3, +                },, +                {, +                  "key" : "8/129/88",, +                  "doc_count" : 2, +                },, +                {]
