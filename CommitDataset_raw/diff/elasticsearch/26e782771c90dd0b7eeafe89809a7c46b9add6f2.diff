It is a, +replacement for the problematic _delete-by-query_ functionality which has been, +removed from Elasticsearch core., +, +Internally, it uses the <<scroll-scan, Scan/Scroll>> and <<docs-bulk, Bulk>>, +APIs to delete documents in an efficient and safe manner. It is slower than, +the old _delete-by-query_ functionality, but fixes the problems with the, +previous implementation., +, +TIP: Queries which match large numbers of documents may run for a long time,, +as every document has to be deleted individually.  Don't use _delete-by-query_, +to clean out all or most documents in an index.  Rather create a new index and, +perhaps reindex the documents you want to keep., +, +=== Installation, +, +This plugin can be installed using the plugin manager:, +, +[source,sh], +----------------------------------------------------------------, +bin/plugin -i elasticsearch/elasticsearch-delete-by-query, +----------------------------------------------------------------, +, +The plugin must be installed on every node in the cluster, and each node must, +be restarted after installation., +, +=== Removal, +, +The plugin can be removed with the following command:, +, +[source,sh], +----------------------------------------------------------------, +bin/plugin -r elasticsearch/elasticsearch-delete-by-query, +----------------------------------------------------------------, +, +The node must be stopped before removing the plugin., +, +=== Usage, +, +The query can either be provided using a simple query string as, +a parameter:, +, +[source,shell], +--------------------------------------------------, +curl -XDELETE 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/_query?q=user:kimchy', +--------------------------------------------------, +, +or using the <<query-dsl,Query DSL>> defined within the request body:, +, +[source,js], +--------------------------------------------------, +curl -XDELETE 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/tweet/_query' -d '{, +    "query" : { <1>, +        "term" : { "user" : "kimchy" }, +    }, +}, +', +--------------------------------------------------, +<1> The query must be passed as a value to the `query` key, in the same way as, +the <<search-search,search api>>., +, +Both of the above examples end up doing the same thing, which is to delete all, +tweets from the twitter index for the user `kimchy`., +, +Delete-by-query supports deletion across <<search-multi-index-type,multiple indices and multiple types>>., +, +==== Query-string parameters, +, +The following query string parameters are supported:, +, +`q`::, +, +Instead of using the <<query-dsl,Query DSL>> to pass a `query` in the request, +body, you can use the `q` query string parameter to  specify a query using, +<<query-string-syntax,`query_string` syntax>>. In this case, the following, +additional parameters are supported: `df`, `analyzer`, `default_operator`,, + `lowercase_expanded_terms`, `analyze_wildcard` and `lenient`., +See <<search-uri-request>> for details., +, +`size`::, +, +The number of hits returned *per shard* by the <<scroll-scan,scroll/scan>>, +request.  Defaults to 10.  May also be specified in the request body., +, +`timeout`::, +, +The maximum execution time of the delete by query process. Once expired, no, +more documents will be deleted., +, +`routing`::, +, +A comma separated list of routing values to control which shards the delete by, +query request should be executed on., +, +When using the `q` parameter, the following additional parameters are]
