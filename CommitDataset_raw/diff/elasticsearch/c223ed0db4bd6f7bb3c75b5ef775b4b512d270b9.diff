[+++ b/docs/reference/search/request/search-type.asciidoc, +The request is processed in two phases. In the first phase, the query, +is forwarded to *all involved shards*. Each shard executes the search, +and generates a sorted list of results, local to that shard. Each, +shard returns *just enough information* to the coordinating node, +to allow it merge and re-sort the shard level results into a globally, +sorted set of results, of maximum length `size`. , +, +During the second phase, the coordinating node requests the document, +content (and highlighted snippets, if any) from *only the relevant, +shards*., +[[query-and-fetch]], +==== Query And Fetch, +, +Parameter value: *query_and_fetch*., +, +The `query_and_fetch` mode is an *internal* optimization which, +is chosen automatically when a `query_then_fetch` request, +targets a single shard only.  Both phases of `query_then_fetch`, +are executed in a single pass.  This mode should not be, +explicitly specified by the user., +, +[[dfs-query-and-fetch]], +==== Dfs, Query And Fetch, +, +Parameter value: *dfs_query_and_fetch*., +, +Same as `query_and_fetch`, except for an initial scatter phase which, +goes and computes the distributed term frequencies for more accurate, +scoring. This mode should not be explicitly specified by the user., +]
