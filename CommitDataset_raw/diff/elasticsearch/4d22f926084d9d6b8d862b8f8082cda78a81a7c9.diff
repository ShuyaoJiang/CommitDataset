There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into Elasticsearch itself., +, +Bug reports, +-----------, +, +If you think you have found a bug in Elasticsearch, first make sure that you are testing against the [latest version of Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/download/) - your issue may already have been fixed. If not, search our [issues list](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues) on GitHub in case a similar issue has already been opened., +, +It is very helpful if you can prepare a reproduction of the bug. In other words, provide a small test case which we can run to confirm your bug. It makes it easier to find the problem and to fix it. Test cases should be provided as `curl` commands which we can copy and paste into a terminal to run it locally, for example:, +, +```sh, +# delete the index, +curl -XDELETE localhost:9200/test, +, +# insert a document, +curl -XPUT localhost:9200/test/test/1 -d '{, + "title": "test document", +}', +, +# this should return XXXX but instead returns YYY, +curl ...., +```, +, +Provide as much information as you can. You may think that the problem lies with your query, when actually it depends on how your data is indexed. The easier it is for us to recreate your problem, the faster it is likely to be fixed., +, +Feature requests, +----------------, +, +If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in Elasticsearch, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that Elasticsearch has today have been added because our users saw the need., +Open an issue on our [issues list](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues) on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work., +, +Contributing code and documentation changes, +-------------------------------------------, +, +If you have a bugfix or new feature that you would like to contribute to Elasticsearch, please find or open an issue about it first. Talk about what you would like to do. It may be that somebody is already working on it, or that there are particular issues that you should know about before implementing the change., +, +We enjoy working with contributors to get their code accepted. There are many approaches to fixing a problem and it is important to find the best approach before writing too much code., +, +The process for contributing to any of the [Elasticsearch repositories](https://github.com/elasticsearch/) is similar. Details for individual projects can be found below., +, +### Fork and clone the repository, +, +You will need to fork the main Elasticsearch code or documentation repository and clone it to your local machine. See , +[github help page](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) for help., +, +Further instructions for specific projects are given below.]
