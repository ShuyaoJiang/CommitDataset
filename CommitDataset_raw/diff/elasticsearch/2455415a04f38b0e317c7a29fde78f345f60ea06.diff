First, the maximum `anomaly_score` per, +job in the overall bucket is calculated. Then the `top_n` of those scores are, +averaged to result in the `overall_score`. This means that you can fine-tune, +the `overall_score` so that it is more or less sensitive to the number, +of jobs that detect an anomaly at the same time. For example, if you set `top_n`, +to `1`, the `overall_score` is the maximum bucket, +score in the overall bucket. Alternatively, if you set `top_n` to the number of, +jobs, the `overall_score` is high only when all jobs detect anomalies in that, +overall bucket., +  (string) Identifier for the job.
