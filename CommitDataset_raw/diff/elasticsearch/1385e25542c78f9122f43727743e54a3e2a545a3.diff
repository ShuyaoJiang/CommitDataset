[+++ b/CONTRIBUTING.md, +Make sure you have [Gradle](http://gradle.org) installed, as, +Elasticsearch uses it as its build system., +, +Eclipse users can automatically configure their IDE: `gradle eclipse`, +then `File: Import: Existing Projects into Workspace`. Select the, +option `Search for nested projects`. Additionally you will want to, +ensure that Eclipse is using 2048m of heap by modifying `eclipse.ini`, +accordingly to avoid GC overhead errors., +, +IntelliJ users acn automatically configure their IDE: `gradle idea`, +then `File->New Project From Existing Sources`. Point to the root of, +the source directory, select, +`Import project from external model->Gradle`, enable, +`Use auto-import`., +, +The Elasticsearch codebase makes heavy use of Java `assert`s and the, +test runner requires that assertions be enabled within the JVM. This, +can be accomplished by passing the flag `-ea` to the JVM on startup., +, +For IntelliJ, go to, +`Run->Edit Configurations...->Defaults->JUnit->VM options` and input, +`-ea`., +, +For Eclipse, go to `Preferences->Java->Installed JREs` and add `-ea` to, +`VM Arguments`.]
