[+++ b/docs/reference/getting-started.asciidoc, +Elasticsearch is a near-realtime search platform. What this means is there is a slight latency (normally one second) from the time you index a document until the time it becomes searchable., +A type used to be a logical category/partition of your index to allow you to store different types of documents in the same index, e.g. one type for users, another type for blog posts.  It is no longer possible to create multiple types in an index, and the whole concept of types will be removed in a later version.  See <<removal-of-types>> for more., +The {ref}/query-dsl-bool-query.html[`bool` query] that we introduced in the previous section also supports `filter` clauses which allow us to use a query to restrict the documents that will be matched by other clauses, without changing how scores are computed. As an example, let's introduce the {ref}/query-dsl-range-query.html[`range` query], which allows us to filter documents by a range of values. This is generally used for numeric or date filtering.]
