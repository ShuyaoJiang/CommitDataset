There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into Elasticsearch itself., +, +Bug reports, +-----------, +, +If you think you have found a bug in Elasticsearch, first make sure that you are testing against the [latest version of Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/download/) - your issue may already have been fixed. If not, search our [issues list](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues) on GitHub in case a similar issue has already been opened., +, +It is very helpful if you can prepare a reproduction of the bug. In other words, provide a small test case which we can run to confirm your bug. It makes it easier to find the problem and to fix it. Test cases should be provided as `curl` commands which we can copy and paste into a terminal to run it locally, for example:, +, +```sh, +# delete the index, +curl -XDELETE localhost:9200/test, +, +# insert a document, +curl -XPUT localhost:9200/test/test/1 -d '{, + "title": "test document", +}', +]
