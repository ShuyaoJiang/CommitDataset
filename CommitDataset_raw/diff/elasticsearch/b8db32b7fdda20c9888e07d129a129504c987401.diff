[+++ b/docs/java-api/client.asciidoc, +The Transport client comes with a cluster sniffing feature which, +allows it to dynamically add new hosts and remove old ones., +When sniffing is enabled the the transport client will connect to the nodes in its, +internal node list, which is built via calls to addTransportAddress., +After this, the client will call the internal cluster state API on those nodes, +to discover available data nodes. The internal node list of the client will, +be replaced with those data nodes only. This list is refreshed every five seconds by default., +Note that the IP addresses the sniffer connects to are the ones declared as the 'publish', +address in those node's elasticsearch config., +, +Keep in mind that list might possibly not include the original node it connected to, +if that node is not a data node. If, for instance, you initially connect to a, +master node, after sniffing no further requests will go to that master node,, +but rather to any data nodes instead. The reason the transport excludes non-data, +nodes is to avoid sending search traffic to master only nodes., +, +In order to enable sniffing, set `client.transport.sniff` to `true`:]
