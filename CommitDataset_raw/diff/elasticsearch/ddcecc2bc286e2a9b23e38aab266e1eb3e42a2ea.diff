[+++ b/docs/reference/testing/testing-framework.asciidoc, +All of the tests are run using a custom junit runner, the `RandomizedRunner` provided by the randomized-testing project. If you are interested in the implementation being used, check out the http://labs.carrotsearch.com/randomizedtesting.html[RandomizedTesting webpage]., +[[parametrized-tests]], +=== parameterized tests, +It is possible to write parameterized tests, that get run multiple times with different parameters. `RandomizedRunner` needs to be used rather than the `Parameterized` runner provided with junit (all the base test classes already use `RandomizedRunner` though). The method that provides the parameters, +needs to be annotated with the `@ParametersFactory` annotation and must be `static`, `public`, without arguments and must have a return type assignable to `Iterable<Object[]>`. The iterable must return arrays conforming to the suite class's constructor with respect to the number and types of parameters., +The constructor's parameters can be annotated with the `@Name` annotation to provide more descriptive parameter names for test descriptions. Have a look at `ElasticsearchRestTests` for an example., +]
