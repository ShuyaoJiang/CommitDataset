The throttling can be disabled by , +setting `requests_per_second` to `-1`., +, +The throttling is done waiting between bulk batches so that it can manipulate the , +scroll timeout. The wait time is the difference between the request scroll search, +size divided by the `requests_per_second` and the `batch_write_time`. By default , +the scroll batch size is `1000`, so if the `requests_per_second` is set to `500`:, +, +`target_total_time` = `1000` / `500 per second` = `2 seconds` +, +`wait_time` = `target_total_time` - `batch_write_time` = `2 seconds` - `.5 seconds` = `1.5 seconds`, +, +Since the batch isn't broken into multiple bulk requests large batch sizes will , +cause Elasticsearch to create many requests and then wait for a while before , +starting the next set. This is "bursty" instead of "smooth". The default is `-1`.]
