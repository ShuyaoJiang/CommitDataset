First, elasticsearch core gets a testing release., +This release is not published on the maven sonatype repo, but is left as a staging repository., +At the same time, the created artifacts are uploaded to the download.elastic.co S3 bucket into, +a private URL, that is comprised of the version and the commit hash., +, +As soon as the core is uploaded there, we can use this repository to build x-plugins against it., +, +## Release x-plugins for a release candidate, +, +In order to upload x-plugins to the elasticsearch core release candidate, you need to execute the, +`release_beta_to_s3` shell script. There are two parameters, first the version to be released and, +second the commit hash, which is part of the URL to download this beta release., +, +```, +sh x-dev-tools/release_beta_to_s3.sh 2.0.0-beta1 468cb61, +```, +, +So, what is this script doing, +, +* Adds the S3 bucket as repository, +* Updates the versions in the pom.xml to reflect the non-snapshot version, +* runs `mvn install` into a local repository, then removes sources and emits the s3cmd command to sync with the core repo, +, +As soon as the Elasticsearch is released, this S3 bucket is just renamed. This, +means, that at this moment, the x-plugins will work for the plugin manager, , +without you having to do anthing!, +, +However, one last step remains..., +, +## Deploying x-plugins into maven repositories, +, +For those, who want to use the jar files as part of their java projects, we have, +to update our own artifactory after the release has been done., +, +In addition to those steps like updating documentation we have to run deploy, +to this repo. What is required for this, is the version of the release and, +the commit hash of the commit in the `x-plugins` repo. , +, +**NOTE: This is not the same commit hash as above** in the release candidate, +process. Luckily the script should fail, when git does not find the commit!, +, +```, +sh release_to_repositories.sh 2.0.0-beta1 75964ad, +```, +, +This script checks out the specified commit hash, removes all the, +`-SNAPSHOT` suffixes and runs `mvn deploy -Pdeploy-public`. The script, +will also wait for you pressing enter before proceeding!, +]
