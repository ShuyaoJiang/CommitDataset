In this case, the goal of the restore is to forget about, +                // what is currently in the index and just restore the state to whatever is in the snapshot., +                // Hence, we are deleting files here if they already exist before writing to them. A better, +                // long term solution would be to use recovery for restoring, so we have more robust restoring, +                // of files (copying to temporary files first and then moving them over).]
