[+++ b/docs/reference/cluster/state.asciidoc, +The cluster state API allows access to metadata representing the state of the, +whole cluster. This includes information such as, +, +* the set of nodes in the cluster, +, +* all cluster-level settings, +, +* information about the indices in the cluster, including their mappings and, +  settings, +, +* the locations of all the shards in the cluster, +, +The response is an internal representation of the cluster state and its format, +may change from version to version. If possible, you should obtain any, +information from the cluster state using the other, more stable,, +<<cluster,cluster APIs>>., +The response provides the cluster state itself, which can be filtered to only, +retrieve the parts of interest as described below., +The cluster's `cluster_uuid` is also returned as part of the top-level response,, +in addition to the `metadata` section. added[6.4.0], +By default, the cluster state request is routed to the master node, to ensure, +that the latest cluster state is returned. For debugging purposes, you can, +retrieve the cluster state local to a particular node by adding `local=true` to, +the query string., +The cluster state contains information about all the indices in the cluster,, +including their mappings, as well as templates and other metadata. This means it, +can sometimes be quite large. To avoid the need to process all this information, +you can request only the part of the cluster state that you need:, +GET /_cluster/state/{metrics}, +`{metrics}` is a comma-separated list of the following options., +    Shows the `routing_table` part of the response. If you supply a comma, +    separated list of indices, the returned output will only contain the routing, +    table for these indices., +    Shows the `metadata` part of the response. If you supply a comma separated, +    list of indices, the returned output will only contain metadata for these, +    indices., +    Shows the `blocks` part of the response., +`_all`::, +    Shows all metrics., +, +The following example returns only `metadata` and `routing_table` data for the, +`foo` and `bar` indices:, +Finally, this example return only the `blocks` metadata:, +]
