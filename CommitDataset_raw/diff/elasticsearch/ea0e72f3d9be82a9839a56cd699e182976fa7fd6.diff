Remote clusters set via the, +<1> `cluster_one` and `cluster_two` are arbitrary cluster aliases representing the connection to each cluster., +These names are subsequently used to distinguish between local and remote indices., +To search the `twitter` index on remote cluster `cluster_1` the index name must be prefixed with the cluster alias, +In contrast to the `tribe` feature cross cluster search can also search indices with the same name on different, +clusters:, +identical these indices will be treated as different indices when results are merged. All results retrieved from a, +remote index, +* `search.remote.initial_connect_timeout` - the time to wait for remote connections to be established when the node, +starts. The default is `30s`., +* `search.remote.node_attribute` - a node attribute to filter out nodes that are eligible as a gateway node in the, +remote cluster. For instance a node can have a node attribute `node.attr.gateway: true`  such that only nodes with this, + attribute will be connected to if `search.remote.node_attribute` is set to `gateway`]
