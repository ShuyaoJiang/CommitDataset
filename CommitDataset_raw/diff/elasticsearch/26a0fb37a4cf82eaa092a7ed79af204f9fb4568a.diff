[+++ b/docs/reference/mapping/dynamic/templates.asciidoc, +[[template-examples]], +==== Template examples, +, +Here are some examples of potentially useful dynamic templates:, +, +===== Structured search, +, +By default elasticsearch will map string fields as a `text` field with a sub, +`keyword` field. However if you are only indexing structured content and not, +interested in full text search, you can make elasticsearch map your fields, +only as `keyword`s. Note that this means that in order to search those fields,, +you will have to search on the exact same value that was indexed., +, +[source,js], +--------------------------------------------------, +PUT my_index, +{, +  "mappings": {, +    "my_type": {, +      "dynamic_templates": [, +        {, +          "strings_as_keywords": {, +            "match_mapping_type": "string",, +            "mapping": {, +              "type": "keyword", +            }, +          }, +        }, +      ], +    }, +  }, +}, +--------------------------------------------------, +, +===== `text`-only mappings for strings, +, +On the contrary to the previous example, if the only thing that you care about, +on your string fields is full-text search, and if you don't plan on running, +aggregations, sorting or exact search on your string fields, you could tell, +elasticsearch to map it only as a text field (which was the default behaviour, +before 5.0):, +, +[source,js], +--------------------------------------------------, +PUT my_index, +{, +  "mappings": {, +    "my_type": {, +      "dynamic_templates": [, +        {, +          "strings_as_text": {, +            "match_mapping_type": "string",, +            "mapping": {, +              "type": "text", +            }, +          }, +        }, +      ], +    }, +  }, +}, +--------------------------------------------------, +, +===== Disabled norms, +, +Norms are index-time scoring factors. If you do not care about scoring, which, +would be the case for instance if you never sort documents by score, you could, +disable the storage of these scoring factors in the index and save some space., +, +[source,js], +--------------------------------------------------, +PUT my_index, +{, +  "mappings": {, +    "my_type": {, +      "dynamic_templates": [, +        {, +          "strings_as_keywords": {, +            "match_mapping_type": "string",, +            "mapping": {, +              "type": "text",, +              "norms": false,, +              "fields": {, +                "keyword": {, +                  "type": "keyword",, +                  "ignore_above": 256, +                }, +              }, +            }, +          }, +        }, +      ], +    }, +  }, +}, +--------------------------------------------------, +, +The sub `keyword` field appears in this template to be consistent with the, +default rules of dynamic mappings. Of course if you do not need them because ]
