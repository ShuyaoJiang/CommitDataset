[+++ b/docs/reference/modules/threadpool.asciidoc, +settings are automatically set based on it. In some cases it can be, +useful to override the number of detected processors. This can be done, +by explicitly setting the `processors` setting., +There are a few use-cases for explicitly overriding the `processors`, +setting:, +, +. If you are running multiple instances of Elasticsearch on the same, +host but want Elasticsearch to size its thread pools as if it only has a, +fraction of the CPU, you should override the `processors` setting to the, +desired fraction (e.g., if you're running two instances of Elasticsearch, +on a 16-core machine, set `processors` to 8). Note that this is an, +expert-level use-case and there's a lot more involved than just setting, +the `processors` setting as there are other considerations like changing, +the number of garbage collector threads, pinning processes to cores,, +etc., +. Sometimes the number of processors is wrongly detected and in such, +cases explicitly setting the `processors` setting will workaround such, +issues., +]
