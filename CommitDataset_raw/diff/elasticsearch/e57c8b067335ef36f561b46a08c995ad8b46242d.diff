[+++ b/docs/reference/getting-started.asciidoc, +A node can be configured to join a specific cluster by the cluster name. By default, each node is set up to join a cluster named `elasticsearch` which means that if you start up a number of nodes on your network and--assuming they can discover each other--they will all automatically form and join a single cluster named `elasticsearch`., +In a single cluster, you can have as many nodes as you want. Furthermore, if there are no other Elasticsearch nodes currently running on your network, starting a single node will by default form a new single-node cluster named `elasticsearch`.]
