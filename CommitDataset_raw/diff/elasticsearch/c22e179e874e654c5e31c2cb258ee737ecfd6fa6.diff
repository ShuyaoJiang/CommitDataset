[+++ b/docs/reference/index-modules/allocation/delayed.asciidoc, +==== Cancellation of shard relocation, +, +If delayed allocation times out, the master assigns the missing shards to, +another node which will start recovery.  If the missing node rejoins the, +cluster, and its shards still have the same sync-id as the primary, shard, +relocation will be cancelled and the synced shard will be used for recovery, +instead., +, +For this reason, the default `timeout` is set to just one minute: even if shard, +relocation begins, cancelling recovery in favour of the synced shard is cheap., +]
