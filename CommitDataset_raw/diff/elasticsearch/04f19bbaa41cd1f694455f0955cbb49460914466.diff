[+++ b/docs/reference/getting-started.asciidoc, +The Bulk API does not fail due to failures of in one of the actions. If a single action fails for whatever reason, it will continue to process the remainder of the actions after it. When the bulk API returns, it will provide a status for each action (in the same order it was sent in) so that you can check if a specific action failed or not.]
