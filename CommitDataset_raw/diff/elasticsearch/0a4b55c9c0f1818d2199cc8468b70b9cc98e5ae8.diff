The restrictions might have to do, +with the authentication method (password, client certificates, etc), the, +user identification method during registration, and other details. {es} implements, +https://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-authn-context-2.0-os.pdf[SAML 2.0 Authentication Context], which can be used for this purpose as defined in SAML 2.0 Core , +Specification., +, +In short, the SAML SP defines a set of Authentication Context Class Reference, +values, which describe the restrictions to be imposed on the IdP, and sends these, +in the Authentication Request. The IdP attempts to grant these restrictions. , +If it cannot grant them, the authentication attempt fails. If the user is , +successfully authenticated, the Authentication Statement of the SAML Response , +contains an indication of the restrictions that were satisfied., +, +You can define the Authentication Context Class Reference values by using the `req_authn_context_class_ref` option in the SAML realm configuration. See , +{ref}/security-settings.html#ref-saml-settings[SAML realm settings]. , +, +{es} supports only the `exact` comparison method for the Authentication Context. , +When it receives the Authentication Response from the IdP, {es} examines the , +value of the Authentication Context Class Reference that is part of the, +Authentication Statement of the SAML Assertion. If it matches one of the , +requested values, the authentication is considered successful. Otherwise, the , +authentication attempt fails., +, +[[saml-sp-metadata]]]
