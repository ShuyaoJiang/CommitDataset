However, one logging message will only be logged, +once, the connection logging taking precedence over the environment variable, +logging., +[[odbc-cfg-dsnparams]], +[float], +==== Connection string parameters, +, +The following is a list of additional parameters that can be configured for a, +particular connection, in case the default behavior of the driver is not, +suitable. This can be done within the client application, in a manner, +particular to that application, generally in a free text input box (sometimes, +named "Connection string", "String extras", or similar).  The format of the, +string is `Attribute1=Value1`. Multiple attributes can be specified, separated, +by a semicolon `Attribute1=Value1;Attribute2=Value2;`. The attribute names are, +given below., +, +`Timeout` (default: `0`)::, +The maximum time (in seconds) a request to the server can take. This can be, +overridden by a larger statement-level timeout setting. The value 0 means no, +timeout., +, +`Follow` (default: `yes`)::, +A boolean value (`yes`|`no` / `true`|`false` / `0`|`1`) controlling if the, +driver will follow HTTP redirects., +, +, +`MaxFetchSize` (default: `0`)::, +The maximum number of rows that {es-sql} server should send the driver for one, +page. This corresponds to {es-sql}'s request parameter `fetch_size` (see, +<<sql-rest-fields>>). The value 0 means server default., +, +, +`MaxBodySizeMB` (default: `100`)::, +The maximum size (in megabytes) that an answer can grow to, before being, +rejected as too large by the driver., +This is concerning the HTTP answer body of one page, not the cumulated data, +volume that a query might generate., +, +, +`ApplyTZ` (default: `no`)::, +A boolean value controlling the timezone of:, +, +* the context in which the query will execute (especially relevant for functions dealing with timestamp components);, +, +* the timestamps received from / sent to the server., +If disabled, the UTC timezone will apply; otherwise, the local machine's set, +timezone., +, +, +`ScientificFloats` (default: `default`)::, +Controls how the floating point numbers will be printed, when these are, +converted to string by the driver. Possible values given to this parameter:, +, +* `scientific`: the exponential notation (ex.: 1.23E01);, +, +* `default`: the default notation (ex.: 12.3);, +, +* `auto`: the driver will choose one of the above depending on the value to be, +printed., +Note that the number of decimals is dependent on the precision (or ODBC scale), +of the value being printed and varies with the different floating point types, +supported by {es-sql}., +This setting is not effective when the application fetches from the driver the, +values as numbers and then does the conversion subsequently itself., +, +, +`VersionChecking` (default: `strict`)::, +By default, the version of the driver and that of the server must be the same., +This parameter will allow a driver to connect to a server of different version., +The variation however can only be of the minor version, both endpoints must be, +of same major version number., +Possible values:, +, +* `strict`: the versions must be in sync;, +, +* `major`: the versions must have the same major number., +, +WARNING: This parameter can only be used for troubleshooting purposes. Running, +with versions out of sync is not supported., +, +, +`MultiFieldLenient` (default: `true`)::]
