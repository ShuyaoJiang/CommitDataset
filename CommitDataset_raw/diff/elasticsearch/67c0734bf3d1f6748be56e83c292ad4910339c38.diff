[+++ b/docs/reference/modules/cluster/misc.asciidoc, +[[cluster-max-tombstones]], +==== Index Tombstones, +, +The cluster state maintains index tombstones to explicitly denote indices that , +have been deleted.  The number of tombstones maintained in the cluster state is , +controlled by the following property, which cannot be updated dynamically:, +, +`cluster.indices.tombstones.size`::, +, +Index tombstones prevent nodes that are not part of the cluster when a delete , +occurs from joining the cluster and reimporting the index as though the delete , +was never issued. To keep the cluster state from growing huge we only keep the , +last `cluster.indices.tombstones.size` deletes, which defaults to 500. You can , +increase it if you expect nodes to be absent from the cluster and miss more , +than 500 deletes. We think that is rare, thus the default. Tombstones don't take , +up much space, but we also think that a number like 50,000 is probably too big., +]
