[+++ b/docs/reference/query-dsl/function-score-query.asciidoc, +Because scores can be on different scales (for example, between 0 and 1 for decay functions but arbitrary for `field_value_factor`) and also, +because sometimes a different impact of functions on the score is desirable, the score of each function can be adjusted with a user defined, +`weight`. The `weight` can be defined per function in the `functions` array (example above) and is multiplied with the score computed by, +the respective function., +In case `score_mode` is set to `avg` the individual scores will be combined by a **weighted** average., +For example, if two functions return score 1 and 2 and their respective weights are 3 and 4, then their scores will be combined as, +`(1*3+2*4)/(3+4)` and **not** `(1*3+2*4)/2`., +]
