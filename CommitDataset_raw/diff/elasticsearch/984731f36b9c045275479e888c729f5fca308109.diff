[+++ b/docs/reference/getting-started.asciidoc, +Whenever we ask for the cluster health, we either get green, yellow, or red., +, +    * Green - everything is good (cluster is fully functional), +    * Yellow - all data is available but some replicas are not yet allocated (cluster is fully functional), +    * Red - some data is not available for whatever reason (cluster is partially functional), +, +**Note:** When a cluster is red, it will continue to serve search requests from the available shards but you will likely need to fix it ASAP since there are unassigned shards.]
