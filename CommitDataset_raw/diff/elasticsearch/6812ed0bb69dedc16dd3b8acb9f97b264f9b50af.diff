[+++ b/docs/reference/getting-started.asciidoc, +Now let's start with some simple searches. There are two basic ways to run searches: one is by sending search parameters through the <<search-uri-request,REST request URI>> and the other by sending them through the <<search-request-body,REST request body>>. The request body method allows you to be more expressive and also to define your searches in a more readable JSON format. We'll try one example of the request URI method but for the remainder of this tutorial, we will exclusively be using the request body method.]
