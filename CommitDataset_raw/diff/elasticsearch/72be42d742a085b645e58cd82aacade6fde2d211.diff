[+++ b/docs/reference/mapping/fields/index-field.asciidoc, +When performing queries across multiple indexes, it is sometimes desirable to, +add query clauses that are associated with documents of only certain indexes., +The `_index` field allows matching on the index a document was indexed into., +Its value is accessible in `term`, or `terms` queries, aggregations,, +scripts, and when sorting:, +, +NOTE: The `_index` is exposed as a virtual field -- it is not added to the, +Lucene index as a real field.  This means that you can use the `_index` field, +in a `term` or `terms` query (or any query that is rewritten to a `term`, +query, such as the `match`,  `query_string` or `simple_query_string` query),, +but it does not support `prefix`, `wildcard`, `regexp`, or `fuzzy` queries.]
