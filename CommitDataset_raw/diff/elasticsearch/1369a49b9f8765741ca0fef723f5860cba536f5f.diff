In order for the communication, +between nodes to be truly secure, the certificates must be validated. The, +recommended approach for validating certificate authenticity in a {es} cluster, +is to trust the certificate authority (CA) that signed the certificate. By doing, +this, as nodes are added to your cluster they just need to use a certificate, +signed by the same CA and the node is automatically allowed to join the cluster., +Additionally, it is recommended that the certificates contain subject alternative, +names (SAN) that correspond to the node's IP address and DNS name so that, +hostname verification can be performed., +, +In order to simplify the process of generating certificates for the Elastic, +Stack, a command line tool, {ref}/certutil.html[`certutil`] has been included, +with {xpack}. This tool takes care of generating a CA and signing certificates, +with the CA. `certutil` can be used interactively or in a silent mode through, +the use of an input file. The `certutil` tool also supports generation of, +certificate signing requests (CSR), so that a commercial- or, +organization-specific CA can be used to sign the certificates. For example:, +, +. Optional: Create a certificate authority for your {es} cluster., ++, +--, +For example, use the `certutil ca` command:, +, +[source,shell], +----------------------------------------------------------, +bin/x-pack/certutil ca, +----------------------------------------------------------, +, +You can configure the cluster to trust all nodes that have a certificate that, +has been signed by this CA., +, +The command outputs a single file, with a default name of `elastic-stack-ca.p12`., +This file is a PKCS#12 keystore that contains the public certificate for your CA, +and the private key that is used to sign the certificates for each node., +, +The `certutil` command also prompts you for a password to protect the file and, +key. If you plan to add more nodes to your cluster in the future, retain a copy, +of the file and remember its password.]
