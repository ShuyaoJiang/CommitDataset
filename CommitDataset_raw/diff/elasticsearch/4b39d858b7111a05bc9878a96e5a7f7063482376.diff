[+++ b/docs/en/rest-api/ml/resultsresource.asciidoc, +Different results types are created for each job., +Anomaly results for _buckets_, _influencers_ and _records_ can be queried using the results API., +These results are written for every `bucket_span`, with the timestamp being the start of the time interval., +As part of the results, scores are calculated for each anomaly result type and each bucket interval. , +These are aggregated in order to reduce noise, and normalized in order to identify and rank the most mathematically significant anomalies., +, +Bucket results provide the top level, overall view of the job and are ideal for alerting on., +For example, at 16:05 the system was unusual., +This is a summary of all the anomalies, pinpointing when they occurred., +, +Influencer results show which entities were anomalous and when., +For example, at 16:05 `user_name: Bob` was unusual., +This is a summary of all anomalies for each entity, so there can be a lot of these results. , +Once you have identified a noteable bucket time, you can look to see which entites were significant., +, +Record results provide the detail showing what the individual anomaly was, when it occurred and which entity was involved., +For example, at 16:05 Bob sent 837262434 bytes, when the typical value was 1067 bytes., +Once you have identifed a bucket time and/or a significant entity, you can drill through to the record results , +in order to investigate the anomalous behavior., +, +//TBD Add links to categorization, +Categorization results contain the definitions of _categories_ that have been identified., +These are only applicable for jobs that are configured to analyze unstructured log data using categorization. , +These results do not contain a timestamp or any calculated scores., +, +* <<ml-results-influencers,Influencers>>, +* <<ml-results-records,Records>>, +[[ml-results-buckets]], +===== Buckets, +Bucket results provide the top level, overall view of the job and are best for alerting., +Each bucket has an `anomaly_score`, which is a statistically aggregated and, +normalized view of the combined anomalousness of all record results within each bucket., +One bucket result is written for each `bucket_span` for each job, even if it is not considered to be anomalous , +(when it will have an `anomaly_score` of zero)., +Upon identifying an anomalous bucket, you can investigate further by either, +expanding the bucket resource to show the records as nested objects or by, +accessing the records resource directly and filtering upon date range., +, +A bucket resource has the following properties:, +, +`anomaly_score`::, +  (number) The maximum anomaly score, between 0-100, for any of the bucket influencers., +  This is an overall, rate limited score for the job., +  All the anomaly records in the bucket contribute to this score., +  This value may be updated as new data is analyzed., +, +`bucket_influencers[]`::, +  (array) An array of bucket influencer objects., +  For more information, see <<ml-results-bucket-influencers,Bucket Influencers>>., +  (time units) The length of the bucket., +`event_count`::, +  (number) The number of input data records processed in this bucket., +`initial_anomaly_score`::, +  (number) The maximum `anomaly_score` for any of the bucket influencers., +  This is this initial value calculated at the time the bucket was processed. , +  (boolean) If true, then this bucket result is an interim result., +  In other words, it is calculated based on partial input data., +  (string) The unique identifier for the job that these results belong to., +`processing_time_ms`::, +  (number) The time in milliseconds taken to analyze the bucket contents and calculate results., +`record_count`::, +  (number) The number of anomaly records in this bucket., +  (string) Internal. This value is always set to "bucket"., +  (date) The start time of the bucket. This timestamp uniquely identifies the bucket. +, ++, +--, +NOTE: Events that occur exactly at the timestamp of the bucket are included in, +the results for the bucket., +--, +, +[float], +[[ml-results-bucket-influencers]], +====== Bucket Influencers, +, +Bucket influencer results are available as nested objects contained within bucket results., +These results are an aggregation for each the type of influencer. , +For example if both client_ip and user_name were specified as influencers, , +then you would be able to find when client_ip's or user_name's were collectively anomalous., +, +There is a built-in bucket influencer called `bucket_time` which is always available., +This is the aggregation of all records in the bucket, and is not just limited to a type of influencer., +, +NOTE: A bucket influencer is a type of influencer. For example, `client_ip` or `user_name`, +can be bucket influencers, whereas `192.168.88.2` and `Bob` are influencers., +, +An bucket influencer object has the following properties:, +, +`anomaly_score`::, +  (number) A normalized score between 0-100, calculated for each bucket influencer., +  This score may be updated as newer data is analyzed., +, +`bucket_span`::, +  (time units) The length of the bucket., +  This value matches the `bucket_span` that is specified in the job., +, +`initial_anomaly_score`::, +  (number) The score between 0-100 for each bucket influencers., +  This is this initial value calculated at the time the bucket was processed. , +]
