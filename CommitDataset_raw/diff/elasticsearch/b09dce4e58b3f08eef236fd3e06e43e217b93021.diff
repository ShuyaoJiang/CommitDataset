For production installations, it is recommended that you copy, +# the sample to one of /usr/share/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.in.sh,, +# /usr/local/share/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.in.sh, or, +# /opt/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.in.sh and make your modifications there., +#, +# Another option is to specify the full path to the include file in the, +# environment. For example:, +#, +#   $ ES_INCLUDE=/path/to/in.sh elasticsearch -p /var/run/es.pid, +#, +# Note: This is particularly handy for running multiple instances on a, +# single installation, or for quick tests.]
