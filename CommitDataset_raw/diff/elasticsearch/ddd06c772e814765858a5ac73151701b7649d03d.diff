[+++ b/docs/resiliency/index.asciidoc, +* {GIT}7360[#7360] validates checksums on all segment files during merges. (STATUS: DONE, fixed in 1.4.0.Beta1), +* {JIRA}5842[LUCENE-5842] validates the structure of the checksum footer of the postings lists, doc values, stored fields and term vectors when opening a new segment, to ensure that these files have not been truncated. (STATUS: DONE, Fixed in Lucene 4.10 and 1.4.0.Beta1), +* {GIT}7586[#7586] adds checksums for cluster and index state files. (STATUS: ONGOING, fixed in 1.5.0), +{JIRA}5895[LUCENE-5895] adds a unique ID for each segment and each commit point. File-based replication (as performed by snapshot/restore) can use this ID to know whether the segment/commit on the source and destination machines are the same.  Fixed in Lucene 5.0., +Recovery from failure is a complicated process, especially in an asynchronous distributed system like Elasticsearch. With several processes happening in parallel, it is important to ensure that recovery proceeds swiftly and safely. While fixing the {GIT}2488[split-brain issue] we have been hunting down corner cases that were not handled optimally, adding tests to demonstrate the issues, and working on fixes:, +* Faster & better detection of master & node failures, including not trying to reconnect upon disconnect, fail on disconnect error on ping, verify cluster names in pings. Previously, Elasticsearch had to wait a bit for the node to complete the process required to join the cluster. Recent changes guarantee that a node has fully joined the cluster before we start the fault detection process. Therefore we can do an immediate check causing faster detection of errors and validation of cluster state after a minimum master node breach. {GIT}6706[#6706], {GIT}7399[#7399] (STATUS: DONE, v1.4.0.Beta1), +* Broaden Unicast pinging when master fails: When a node loses itâ€™s current master it will start pinging to find a new one. Previously, when using unicast based pinging, the node would ping a set of predefined nodes asking them whether the master had really disappeared or whether there was a network hiccup. Now, we ping all nodes in the cluster to increase coverage. In the case that all unicast hosts are disconnected from the current master during a network failure, this improvement is essential to allow the cluster to reform once the partition is healed. {GIT}7336[#7336] (STATUS: DONE, v1.4.0.Beta1), +* After joining a cluster, validate that the join was successful and that the master has been set in the local cluster state. {GIT}6969[#6969]. (STATUS: DONE, v1.4.0.Beta1), +While the work is going on, we tightened the current checks by bringing them closer to the index code. See {GIT}7873[#7873] (STATUS: DONE, fixed in 1.4.0), +, +, +[float], +=== Add a minimum weight to filter cache entries (STATUS: ONGOING), +, +Commonly used filters are cached in Elasticsearch. That cache is limited in size (10% of node's memory by default) and is being evicted based on a least recently used policy. The amount of memory used by the cache depends on two primary components - the values it stores and the keys associated with them. Calculating the memory footprint of the values is easy enough but the keys accounting is trickier to achieve as they are, by default, raw Lucene objects. This is largely not a problem as the keys are dominated by the values. However, recent optimizations in Lucene have changed the balance causing the filter cache to grow beyond it's size., +, +While we are working on a longer term solution, we introduced a minimum weight of 1k for each cache entry. This puts an effective limit on the number of entries in the cache.
