[+++ b/docs/reference/cluster/reroute.asciidoc, +[float], +=== Retry failed shards, +, +The cluster will attempt to allocate a shard a maximum of, +`index.allocation.max_retries` times in a row (defaults to `5`), before giving, +up and leaving the shard unallocated. This scenario can be caused by, +structural problems such as having an analyzer which refers to a stopwords, +file which doesn't exist on all nodes., +, +Once the problem has been corrected, allocation can be manually retried by, +calling the <<cluster-reroute,`reroute`>> API with `?retry_failed`, which, +will attempt a single retry round for these shards., +, +[float], +=== Forced allocation on unrecoverable errors, +, +The following two commands are dangerous and may result in data loss. They are, +meant to be used in cases where the original data can not be recovered and the cluster, +administrator accepts the loss. If you have suffered a temporary issue that has been , +fixed, please see the `retry_failed` flag described above.]
