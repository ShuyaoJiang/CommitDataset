There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into Elasticsearch itself., +If you think you have found a bug in Elasticsearch, first make sure that you are testing against the [latest version of Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/download/) - your issue may already have been fixed. If not, search our [issues list](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues) on GitHub in case a similar issue has already been opened., +Open an issue on our [issues list](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues) on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work., +The process for contributing to any of the [Elasticsearch repositories](https://github.com/elasticsearch/) is similar. Details for individual projects can be found below., +Run the test suite to make sure that nothing is broken., +Please make sure you have signed our [Contributor License Agreement](http://www.elasticsearch.org/contributor-agreement/). We are not asking you to assign copyright to us, but to give us the right to distribute your code without restriction. We ask this of all contributors in order to assure our users of the origin and continuing existence of the code. You only need to sign the CLA once., +Update your local repository with the most recent code from the main Elasticsearch repository, and rebase your branch on top of the latest master branch. We prefer your changes to be squashed into a single commit., +Push your local changes to your forked copy of the repository and [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). In the pull request, describe what your changes do and mention the number of the issue where discussion has taken place, eg "Closes #123"., +Contributing to the Elasticsearch plugin, +----------------------------------------, +**Repository:** [https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-mapper-attachments](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-mapper-attachments), +, +Make sure you have [Maven](http://maven.apache.org) installed, as Elasticsearch uses it as its build system. Integration with IntelliJ and Eclipse should work out of the box. Eclipse users can automatically configure their IDE by running `mvn eclipse:eclipse` and then importing the project into their workspace: `File > Import > Existing project into workspace`., +cd elasticsearch-mapper-attachments/, +mvn clean package -DskipTests, +You will find the newly built packages under: `./target/releases/`., +mvn clean test, +Source: [Contributing to elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/contributing-to-elasticsearch/), +++ /dev/null, +++ b/.gitignore, +/data]
