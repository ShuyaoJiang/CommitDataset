[+++ b/docs/reference/analysis/tokenfilters/compound-word-tokenfilter.asciidoc, +The `hyphenation_decompounder` and `dictionary_decompounder` token filters can, +decompose compound words found in many German languages into word parts., +Both token filters require a dictionary of word parts, which can be provided, +as:, +[horizontal], +`word_list`::, +An array of words, specified inline in the token filter configuration, or, +`word_list_path`::, +The path (either absolute or relative to the `config` directory) to a UTF-8, +encoded file containing one word per line., +[float], +=== Hyphenation decompounder, +The `hyphenation_decompounder` uses hyphenation grammars to find potential, +subwords that are then checked against the word dictionary. The quality of the, +output tokens is directly connected to the quality of the grammar file you, +use. For languages like German they are quite good., +XML based hyphenation grammar files can be found in the, +http://offo.sourceforge.net/hyphenation/#FOP+XML+Hyphenation+Patterns[Objects For Formatting Objects], +(OFFO) Sourceforge project. You can download http://downloads.sourceforge.net/offo/offo-hyphenation.zip[offo-hyphenation.zip], +directly and look in the `offo-hyphenation/hyph/` directory., +Credits for the hyphenation code go to the Apache FOP project ., +, +[float], +=== Dictionary decompounder, +, +The `dictionary_decompounder` uses a brute force approach in conjuction with, +only the word dictionary to find subwords in a compound word. It is much, +slower than the hyphenation decompounder but can be used as a first start to, +check the quality of your dictionary., +, +[float], +=== Compound token filter parameters, +, +The following parameters can be used to configure a compound word token, +filter:, +, +[horizontal], +`type`::, +, +Either `dictionary_decompounder` or `hyphenation_decompounder`., +, +`word_list`::, +, +A array containing a list of words to use for the word dictionary., +, +`word_list_path`::, +, +The path (either absolute or relative to the `config` directory) to the word dictionary., +, +`hyphenation_patterns_path`::, +, +The path (either absolute or relative to the `config` directory) to a FOP XML hyphenation pattern file. (required for hyphenation), +, +`min_word_size`::, +, +Minimum word size. Defaults to 5., +, +`min_subword_size`::, +, +Minimum subword size. Defaults to 2., +, +`max_subword_size`::, +, +Maximum subword size. Defaults to 15., +, +`only_longest_match`::, +, +Whether to include only the longest matching subword or not.  Defaults to `false`, +, +                hyphenation_patterns_path: path/to/fop.xml]
