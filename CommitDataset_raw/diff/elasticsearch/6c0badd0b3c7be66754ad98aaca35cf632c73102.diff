It is not indexed (searchable),, +just stored. When executing "fetch" requests, like <<docs-get,get>> or, +<<search-search,search>>, the `_source` field is returned by default., +==== Disabling source, +, +Though very handy to have around, the source field does incur storage overhead, +within the index. For this reason, it can be disabled as follows:, +, +[source,js], +--------------------------------------------------, +PUT tweets, +{, +  "mappings": {},, +  "tweet": {, +    "_source": {, +      "enabled": false, +    }, +  }, +}, +--------------------------------------------------, +// AUTOSENSE, +, +[WARNING], +.Think before disabling the source field, +==================================================, +, +Users often disable the `_source` field without thinking about the, +consequences, and then live to regret it.  If the `_source` field isn't, +available then a number of features are not supported:, +, +* The <<docs-update,`update` API>>., +, +* On the fly <<search-request-highlighting,highlighting>>., +, +* The ability to reindex from one Elasticsearch index to another, either, +  to change mappings or analysis, or to upgrade an index to a new major, +  version., +, +* The ability to debug queries or aggregations by viewing the original, +  document used at index time., +, +* Potentially in the future, the ability to repair index corruption, +  automatically., +, +If disk space is a concern, rather increase the, +<<index-codec,compression level>> instead of disabling the `_source`., +==================================================, +, +.The metrics use case, +**************************************************, +, +The _metrics_ use case is distinct from other time-based or logging use cases, +in that there are many small documents which consist only of numbers, dates,, +or keywords.  There are no updates, no highlighting requests, and the data, +ages quickly so there is no need to reindex.  Search requests typically use, +simple queries to filter the dataset by date or tags, and the results are, +returned as aggregations., +, +In this case, disabling the `_source` field will save space and reduce I/O., +It is also advisable to disable the <<mapping-all-field,`_all` field>> in the, +metrics case., +, +**************************************************, +, +, +[[include-exclude]], +==== Including / Excluding fields from source, +, +An expert-only feature is the ability to prune the contents of the `_source`, +field after the document has been indexed, but before the `_source` field is, +stored.  The `includes`/`excludes` parameters (which also accept wildcards), +can be used as follows:, +, +[source,js], +--------------------------------------------------, +PUT logs, +{, +  "mappings": {, +    "event": {, +      "_source": {, +        "includes": [, +          "*.count",, +          "meta.*", +        ],, +        "excludes": [, +          "meta.description",, +          "meta.other.*", +        ], +      }, +    }, +  }, +}, +, +PUT logs/event/1]
