[+++ b/docs/reference/setup/bootstrap-checks.asciidoc, +By default, Elasticsearch binds to `localhost` for <<modules-http,HTTP>>, +and <<modules-transport,transport (internal)>> communication. This is, +development but it's useless for production systems. To form a cluster,, +Elasticsearch instances must be reachable via transport communication so, +they must bind transport to an external interface. Thus, we consider an, +Elaticsearch instance to be in development mode if it does not bind, +transport to an external interface (the default), and is otherwise in, +production mode if it does bind transport to an external interface. Note, +that HTTP can be configured independently of transport via, +<<modules-http,`http.host>> and, +<<modules-transport,`transport.tcp.host`>>; this can be useful for, +configuring a single instance to be reachable via HTTP for testing, +purposes without triggering production mode.]
