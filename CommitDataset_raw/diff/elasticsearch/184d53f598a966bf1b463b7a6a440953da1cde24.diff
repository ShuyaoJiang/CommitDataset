Restart Elasticsearch., +, +[[pki-ssl-config]], +==== PKI and SSL Settings, +, +The PKI realm relies on the SSL settings of the node's network interface, +(transport or http). The realm can be configured to be more restrictive than, +the underlying network connection - that is, it is possible to configure the, +node such that some connections are accepted by the network interface but then, +fail to be authenticated by the PKI realm. However the reverse is not possible, +- the PKI realm cannot authenticate a connection that has been refused by the, +network interface., +, +In particular this means:, +, +* The transport or http interface must request client certificates by setting, +  `client_authentication` to `optional` or `required`., +* The interface must _trust_ the certificate that is presented by the client, +  by configuring either the `truststore` or `certificate_authorities` paths,, +  or by setting `verification_mode` to `none`., +* The _protocols_ supported by the interface must be compatible with those, +  used by the client., +, +, +The relevant network interface (transport or http) must be configured to trust, +any certificate that is to be used within the PKI realm.
