To do so, just run the following command on every node on your cluster (restart node for it to have effect):, +, +```, +./bin/plugin -i elasticsearch/marvel/latest, +```, +, +Once done, open up the following url (assuming standard ES config): http://localhost:9200/_plugin/marvel  . This will take you to the Overview Dashboard. Use Kibana's Load dashboard menu to navigate to the Cluster Pulse dashboard, +, +, +## I just want to run Sense, +, +To run Sense, checkout a copy of this repo. You can now double click `sense/index.html` and it will open in your default browser., +, +For a cleaner experience, we recommend using something like http://anvilformac.com and point it at the repo checkout. Once done you can access Sense via `http://webserver/sense/`, for example http://elasticsearch-marvel.dev/sense if using Anvil., +, +Note: to run the Kibana side of Marvel, you'd need to install grunt as described bellow., +, +## Grunt build system (for running the UI from a code checkout), +This grunt-based build system handles Kibana development environment setup for Marvel as well as building, packaging and distribution of the Marvel plugin. Note that you **must** run *grunt setup* before any other tasks as this build system reuses parts of the Kibana build system that must be fetched, +, +### Installing, +You will need node.js+npm and grunt. Node is available via brew, install grunt with the command below. Once grunt is installed you may run grunt tasks to setup your environment and build Marvel, +, +```npm install -g grunt-cli```, +, +```npm install```, +, +### Tasks, +, +```grunt setup```, +, +**Run this first.** It will download the right Kibana version to ./vendor/kibana, copies the appropriate config.js to the right place and make any symlinks needed for a proper marvel/kibana environment, +, +```grunt server```, +, +Starts a web server on http://127.0.0.1:5601 pointing at the kibana directory, while also serving custom marvel panels., +, +You can use `grunt server --port=5601 --es_host=9200` to control the ports used for kibana and the elasticsearch port used., +, +```grunt jshint```, +, +Lints code without building, +, +```grunt build```, +, +Merges kibana and marvel code, builds Kibana and the plugin (via mvn) and puts them in ./build., +, +```grunt package```, +, +Zips and tar+gzips the build in build/packages. Includes grunt build, +, +```grunt release```, +, +Uploads created archives to download.elasticsearch.org/elasticsearch/marvel/marvel-VERSION.extention. You will need S3 credentials in .aws-config.json. Format as so:, +, +```, +{, +  "key":"MY_KEY_HERE",, +  "secret":"your/long/secret/string", +}, +, +```, +, +To upload the current archive as the "latest" release, use:, +]
