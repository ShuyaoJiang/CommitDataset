[+++ b/docs/reference/setup/as-a-service.asciidoc, +== Running As a Service on Linux, +In order to run elasticsearch as a service on your operating system, the provided packages try to make it as easy as possible for you to start and stop elasticsearch during reboot and upgrades., +=== Linux, +, +Currently our build automatically creates a debian package and an RPM package, which is available on the download page. The package itself does not have any dependencies, but you have to make sure that you installed a JDK., +, +Each package features a configuration file, which allows you to set the following parameters, +`ES_USER`::               The user to run as, defaults to `elasticsearch`, +`ES_GROUP`::              The group to run as, defaults to `elasticsearch`, +`ES_HEAP_SIZE`::          The heap size to start with, +`ES_HEAP_NEWSIZE`::       The size of the new generation heap, +`ES_DIRECT_SIZE`::        The maximum size of the direct memory, +`MAX_OPEN_FILES`::       Maximum number of open files, defaults to `65535`, +`MAX_LOCKED_MEMORY`::     Maximum locked memory size. Set to "unlimited" if you use the bootstrap.mlockall option in elasticsearch.yml. You must also set ES_HEAP_SIZE., +`LOG_DIR`::               Log directory, defaults to `/var/log/elasticsearch`, +`DATA_DIR`::              Data directory, defaults to `/var/lib/elasticsearch`, +`WORK_DIR`::              Work directory, defaults to `/tmp/elasticsearch`, +`CONF_DIR`::              Configuration file directory (which needs to include `elasticsearch.yml` and `logging.yml` files), defaults to `/etc/elasticsearch`, +`CONF_FILE`::             Path to configuration file, defaults to `/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml`, +`ES_JAVA_OPTS`::          Any additional java options you may want to apply, +`RESTART_ON_UPGRADE`::    Configure restart on package upgrade, defaults to `false`. This means you will have to restart your elasticsearch instance after installing a package manually. The reason for this is to ensure, that upgrades in a cluster do not result in a continouos shard reallocation resulting in high network traffic and reducing the response times of your cluster., +==== Debian/Ubuntu, +The debian package ships with everything you need as it uses standard debian tools like update `update-rc.d` to define the runlevels it runs on. The init script is placed at `/etc/init.d/elasticsearch` is you would expect it. The configuration file is placed at `/etc/default/elasticsearch`., +==== RedHat/Centos/Fedora, +RedHat based distributions are using `chkconfig` to enable and disable services. The init script is at `/etc/init.d/elasticsearch`, where as the configuration file is placed at `/etc/sysconfig/elasticsearch`., +==== SuSe, +SuSe does not use the `chkconfig` tool to register services, but rather `systemd` and its command `/bin/systemctl` to start and stop services. The configuration file is also placed at `/etc/sysconfig/elasticsearch`.]
