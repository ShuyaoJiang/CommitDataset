[+++ b/x-pack/docs/en/security/authentication/configuring-pki-realm.asciidoc, +[role="xpack"], +[[configuring-pki-realm]], +=== Configuring a PKI realm, +, +You can configure {security} to use Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificates, +to authenticate users in {es}. This requires clients to present X.509, +certificates., +, +NOTE: You cannot use PKI certificates to authenticate users in {kib}., +, +To use PKI in {es}, you configure a PKI realm, enable client authentication on, +the desired network layers (transport or http), and map the Distinguished Names, +(DNs) from the user certificates to {security} roles in the role mapping file., +, +You can also use a combination of PKI and username/password authentication. For, +example, you can enable SSL/TLS on the transport layer and define a PKI realm to, +require transport clients to authenticate with X.509 certificates, while still, +authenticating HTTP traffic using username and password credentials. You can , +also set `xpack.security.transport.ssl.client_authentication` to `optional` to , +allow clients without certificates to authenticate with other credentials., +, +IMPORTANT:  You must enable SSL/TLS and enable client authentication to use PKI., +, +For more information, see {xpack-ref}/pki-realm.html[PKI User Authentication]., +, +. Add a realm configuration of type `pki` to `elasticsearch.yml` under the, +`xpack.security.authc.realms` namespace. At a minimum, you must set the realm , +`type` to `pki`. If you are configuring multiple realms, you should also , +explicitly set the `order` attribute. See <<ref-pki-settings>> for all of the , +options you can set for a `pki` realm., ++, +--, +For example, the following snippet shows the most basic `pki` realm configuration:, +, +[source, yaml], +------------------------------------------------------------, +xpack:, +  security:, +    authc:, +      realms:, +        pki1:, +          type: pki, +------------------------------------------------------------, +, +With this configuration, any certificate trusted by the SSL/TLS layer is accepted, +for authentication. The username is the common name (CN) extracted from the DN, +of the certificate., +, +IMPORTANT: When you configure realms in `elasticsearch.yml`, only the, +realms you specify are used for authentication. If you also want to use the, +`native` or `file` realms, you must include them in the realm chain., +, +If you want to use something other than the CN of the DN as the username, you, +can specify a regex to extract the desired username. For example, the regex in, +the following configuration extracts the email address from the DN:, +, +[source, yaml], +------------------------------------------------------------, +xpack:, +  security:, +    authc:, +      realms:, +        pki1:, +          type: pki, +          username_pattern: "EMAILADDRESS=(.*?)(?:,|$)", +------------------------------------------------------------, +--, +, +. Restart {es}., +, +. <<configuring-tls,Enable SSL/TLS>>. , +, +. Enable client authentication on the desired network layers (transport or http)., ++, +--, +//TBD: This step might need to be split into a separate topic with additional details, +//about setting up client authentication. , +The PKI realm relies on the TLS settings of the node's network interface. The , +realm can be configured to be more restrictive than the underlying network , +connection - that is, it is possible to configure the node such that some , +connections are accepted by the network interface but then fail to be , +authenticated by the PKI realm. However, the reverse is not possible. The PKI , +realm cannot authenticate a connection that has been refused by the network , +interface., +, +In particular this means:, +, +* The transport or http interface must request client certificates by setting, +  `client_authentication` to `optional` or `required`., +* The interface must _trust_ the certificate that is presented by the client, +  by configuring either the `truststore` or `certificate_authorities` paths,, +  or by setting `verification_mode` to `none`. See , +  <<ssl-tls-settings,`xpack.ssl.verification_mode`>> for an explanation of this , +  setting., +* The _protocols_ supported by the interface must be compatible with those, +  used by the client., +, +The relevant network interface (transport or http) must be configured to trust, +any certificate that is to be used within the PKI realm. However, it possible to]
