See, +  `matched_fields`, +, +, +added[0.90.8], +[[matched-fields]], +==== Matched Fields, +The Fast Vector Highlighter can combine matches on multiple fields to, +highlight a single field using `matched_fields`.  This is most, +intuitive for multifields that analyze the same string in different, +ways.  All `matched_fields` must have `term_vector` set to, +`with_positions_offsets` but only the field to which the matches are, +combined is loaded so only that field would benefit from having, +`store` set to `yes`., +, +In the following examples `content` is analyzed by the `english`, +analyzer and `content.plain` is analyzed by the `standard` analyzer., +, +[source,js], +--------------------------------------------------, +{, +    "query": {, +        "query_string": {, +            "query": "content.plain:running scissors",, +            "fields": ["content"], +        }, +    },, +    "highlight": {, +        "order": "score",, +        "fields": {, +            "content": {, +                "matched_fields": ["content", "content.plain"],, +                "type" : "fvh", +            }, +        }, +    }, +}, +--------------------------------------------------, +The above matches both "run with scissors" and "running with scissors", +and would highlight "running" and "scissors" but not "run". If both, +phrases appear in a large document then "running with scissors" is, +sorted above "run with scissors" in the fragments list because there, +are more matches in that fragment., +, +[source,js], +--------------------------------------------------, +{, +    "query": {, +        "query_string": {, +            "query": "running scissors",, +            "fields": ["content", "content.plain^10"], +        }, +    },, +    "highlight": {, +        "order": "score",, +        "fields": {, +            "content": {, +                "matched_fields": ["content", "content.plain"],, +                "type" : "fvh", +            }, +        }, +    }, +}, +--------------------------------------------------, +The above highlights "run" as well as "running" and "scissors" but, +still sorts "running with scissors" above "run with scissors" because, +the plain match ("running") is boosted., +, +[source,js], +--------------------------------------------------, +{, +    "query": {, +        "query_string": {, +            "query": "running scissors",, +            "fields": ["content", "content.plain^10"], +        }, +    },, +    "highlight": {, +        "order": "score",, +        "fields": {, +            "content": {, +                "matched_fields": ["content.plain"],, +                "type" : "fvh", +            }, +        }, +    }, +}, +--------------------------------------------------, +The above query wouldn't highlight "run" or "scissor" but shows that, +it is just fine not to list the field to which the matches are combined, +(`content`) in the matched fields., +, +[NOTE], +Technically it is also fine to add fields to `matched_fields` that, +don't share the same underlying string as the field to which the matches, +are combined.  The results might not make much sense and if one of the, +matches is off the end of the text then the whole the query will fail., +, +[NOTE]]
