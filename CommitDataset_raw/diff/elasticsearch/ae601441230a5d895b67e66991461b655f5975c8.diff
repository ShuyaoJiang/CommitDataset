[+++ b/docs/reference/modules/http.asciidoc, +`http.enabled` to `false`. Elasticsearch nodes (and Java clients) communicate, +internally using the <<modules-transport,transport interface>>, not HTTP. It, +might make  sense to disable the `http` layer entirely on nodes which are not, +meant to serve REST requests directly. For instance, you could disable HTTP on, +<<modules-node,data-only nodes>> if you also have, +<<modules-node,client nodes>> which are intended to serve all REST requests., +Be aware, however, that you will not be able to send any REST requests (eg to, +retrieve node stats) directly to nodes which have HTTP disabled.]
