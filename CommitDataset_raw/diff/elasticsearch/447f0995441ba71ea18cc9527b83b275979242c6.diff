It has a, +  <<glossary-mapping,mapping>> which defines the <<glossary-field,fields>> in the index,, +  which are grouped by multiple <<glossary-type,type>>., +  A type represents the _type_ of document, e.g. an `email`, a `user`, or a `tweet`., +  The search API can filter documents by type., +  An <<glossary-index,index>> can contain multiple types, and each type has a, +  <<glossary-document,documents>> of that type.  Fields with the same, +  name in different types in the same index must have the same <<glossary-mapping,mapping>>, +  (which defines how each field in the document is indexed and made searchable).]
