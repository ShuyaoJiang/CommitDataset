It is possible to change this behaviour as documented below:, +WARNING: Sorting by ascending `_count` or by sub aggregation is discouraged as it increases the, +<<search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation-approximate-counts,error>> on document counts., +It is fine when a single shard is queried, or when the field that is being aggregated was used, +as a routing key at index time: in these cases results will be accurate since shards have disjoint, +values. However otherwise, errors are unbounded. One particular case that could still be useful, +is sorting by <<search-aggregations-metrics-min-aggregation,`min`>> or, +<<search-aggregations-metrics-max-aggregation,`max`>> aggregation: counts will not be accurate, +but at least the top buckets will be correctly picked., +, +Ordering the buckets by their doc `_count` in an ascending manner:, +.Pipeline aggs cannot be used for sorting, +[INFO], +=======================================, +, +<<search-aggregations-pipeline,Pipeline aggregations>> are run during the, +reduce phase after all other aggregations have already completed.  For this, +reason, they cannot be used for ordering., +, +=======================================]
