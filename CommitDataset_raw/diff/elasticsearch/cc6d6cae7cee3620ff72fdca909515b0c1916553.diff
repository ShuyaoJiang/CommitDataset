[+++ b/x-pack/docs/en/ml/detector-custom-rules.asciidoc, +Let us assume we are configuring a job in order to detect DNS data exfiltration., +First, we need to create a list of our safe domains. Those lists are called , +_filters_ in {ml}. Filters can be shared across jobs., +Now, we can create our job specifying a scope that uses the `safe_domains` , +filter for the `highest_registered_domain` field:, +Note that we can use any of the `partition_field_name`, `over_field_name`, or , +`by_field_name` fields in the `scope`., +, +the {ref}/ml-update-job.html[update job API] to do so. However, the rule we , +added will only be in effect for any results created from the moment we added , +the rule onwards. Past results will remain unaffected.]
