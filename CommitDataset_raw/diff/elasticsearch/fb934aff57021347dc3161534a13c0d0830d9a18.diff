[+++ b/docs/reference/modules/gateway/local.asciidoc, +[float], +==== Dangling indices, +, +When a node joins the cluster, any shards/indices stored in its  local `data/`, +directory which do not already exist in the cluster will be imported into the, +cluster by default.  This functionality has two purposes:, +, +1. If a new master node is started which is unaware of the other indices in, +   the cluster, adding the old nodes will cause the old indices to be, +   imported, instead of being deleted., +, +2. An old index can be added to an existing cluster by copying it to the, +   `data/` directory of a new node, starting the node and letting it join, +   the cluster. Once the index has been replicated to other nodes in the, +   cluster, the new node can be shut down and removed., +, +The import of dangling indices can be controlled with the, +`gateway.local.auto_import_dangled` which accepts:, +, +[horizontal], +`yes`::, +, +    Import dangling indices into the cluster (default)., +, +`close`::, +, +    Import dangling indices into the cluster state, but leave them closed., +, +`no`::, +, +    Delete dangling indices after `gateway.local.dangling_timeout`, which, +    defaults to 2 hours.]
