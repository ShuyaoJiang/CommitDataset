[+++ b/docs/reference/search/benchmark.asciidoc, +To be eligible to run benchmarks nodes must be started with: *es.node.bench=true*. This is just a way to mark certain nodes as "executors". Searches will still be distributed out to the cluster in the normal manner. This is primarily a defensive measure to prevent production nodes from being flooded with potentially many requests. Typically one would start a single node with this setting and submit benchmark requests to it.]
