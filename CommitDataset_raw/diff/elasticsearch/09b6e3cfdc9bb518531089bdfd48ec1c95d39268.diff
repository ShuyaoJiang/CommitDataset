[+++ b/README.asciidoc, +, += Testing with Elasticsearch, +Sometimes it is useful to use your local elasticsearch checkout with x-plugins. To do this, run the following commands:, +cd buildSrc, +gradle attach --name elasticsearch --path /path/to/elasticsearch/buildSrc, +cd .., +gradle attach --name elasticsearch --path /path/to/elasticsearch, +, +This will cause building x-plugins to reflect any changes in your elasticsearch repo. For example, if you make a change to elasticsearch core, building x-plugins will first re-build elasticsearch core, and use that when building x-plugins., +]
