[+++ b/docs/reference/search.asciidoc, +[float], +[[global-search-timeout]], +== Global Search Timeout, +, +Individual searches can have a timeout as part of the, +<<search-request-body>>. Since search requests can originate from many, +sources, Elasticsearch has a dynamic cluster-level setting for a global, +search timeout that applies to all search requests that do not set a, +timeout in the <<search-request-body>>. The default value is no global, +timeout. The setting key is `search.default_search_timeout` and can be, +set using the <<cluster-update-settings>> endpoints. Setting this value, +to `-1` resets the global search timeout to no timeout., +]
