[+++ b/docs/reference/migration/migrate_5_0.asciidoc, +Elasticsearch 5.0 can read indices created in version 2.0 or above.  An, +Elasticsearch 5.0 node will not start in the presence of indices created in a, +version of Elasticsearch before 2.0., +The first time Elasticsearch 5.0 starts, it will automatically rename index, +folders to use the index UUID instead of the index name. If you are using, +<<indices-shadow-replicas,shadow replicas>> with shared data folders, first, +start a single node with access to all data folders, and let it rename all, +index folders before starting other nodes in the cluster., +]
