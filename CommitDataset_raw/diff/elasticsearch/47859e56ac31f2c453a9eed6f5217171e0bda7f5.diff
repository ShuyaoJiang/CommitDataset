It, +provides unicast and file-based discovery, and can be extended to support cloud, +environments and other forms of discovery via plugins., +Zen discovery is integrated with other modules, for example, all communication, +between nodes is done using the <<modules-transport,transport>> module., +This is the process where a node uses the discovery mechanisms to find other, +nodes., +, +[float], +[[discovery-seed-nodes]], +==== Seed nodes, +, +Zen discovery uses a list of _seed_ nodes in order to start off the discovery, +process. At startup, or when electing a new master, Elasticsearch tries to, +connect to each seed node in its list, and holds a gossip-like conversation with, +them to find other nodes and to build a complete picture of the cluster. By, +default there are two methods for configuring the list of seed nodes: _unicast_, +and _file-based_.  It is recommended that the list of seed nodes comprises the, +list of master-eligible nodes in the cluster., +Unicast discovery configures a static list of hosts for use as seed nodes., +These hosts can be specified as hostnames or IP addresses; hosts specified as, +hostnames are resolved to IP addresses during each round of pinging. Note that, +if you are in an environment where DNS resolutions vary with time, you might, +need to adjust your <<networkaddress-cache-ttl,JVM security settings>>., +The list of hosts is set using the `discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts` static, +setting.  This is either an array of hosts or a comma-delimited string. Each, +value should be in the form of `host:port` or `host` (where `port` defaults to, +the setting `transport.profiles.default.port` falling back to, +`transport.tcp.port` if not set). Note that IPv6 hosts must be bracketed. The, +default for this setting is `127.0.0.1, [::1]`, +Additionally, the `discovery.zen.ping.unicast.resolve_timeout` configures the, +amount of time to wait for DNS lookups on each round of pinging. This is, +specified as a <<time-units, time unit>> and defaults to 5s., +Unicast discovery uses the <<modules-transport,transport>> module to perform the, +discovery., +[float], +[[file-based-hosts-provider]], +===== File-based, +, +In addition to hosts provided by the static `discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts`, +setting, it is possible to provide a list of hosts via an external file., +Elasticsearch reloads this file when it changes, so that the list of seed nodes, +can change dynamically without needing to restart each node. For example, this, +gives a convenient mechanism for an Elasticsearch instance that is run in a, +Docker container to be dynamically supplied with a list of IP addresses to, +connect to for Zen discovery when those IP addresses may not be known at node, +startup., +, +To enable file-based discovery, configure the `file` hosts provider as follows:, +, +```, +discovery.zen.hosts_provider: file, +```, +, +Then create a file at `$ES_PATH_CONF/unicast_hosts.txt` in, +<<discovery-file-format,the format described below>>. Any time a change is made, +to the `unicast_hosts.txt` file the new changes will be picked up by, +Elasticsearch and the new hosts list will be used., +, +Note that the file-based discovery plugin augments the unicast hosts list in, +`elasticsearch.yml`: if there are valid unicast host entries in, +`discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts` then they will be used in addition to those, +supplied in `unicast_hosts.txt`., +, +The `discovery.zen.ping.unicast.resolve_timeout` setting also applies to DNS, +lookups for nodes specified by address via file-based discovery. This is, +specified as a <<time-units, time unit>> and defaults to 5s., +, +[[discovery-file-format]], +[float], +====== unicast_hosts.txt file format, +, +The format of the file is to specify one node entry per line.  Each node entry, +consists of the host (host name or IP address) and an optional transport port, +number.  If the port number is specified, is must come immediately after the, +host (on the same line) separated by a `:`.  If the port number is not, +specified, a default value of 9300 is used., +, +For example, this is an example of `unicast_hosts.txt` for a cluster with four, +nodes that participate in unicast discovery, some of which are not running on, +the default port:]
