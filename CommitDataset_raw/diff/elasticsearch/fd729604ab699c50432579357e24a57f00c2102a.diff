[+++ b/docs/reference/migration/migrate_5_0.asciidoc, +==== Elasticsearch will no longer detect logging implementations, +, +Elasticsearch now logs only to log4j 1.2. Previously if log4j wasn't on the classpath it made some effort to degrade to, +slf4j or java.util.logging. Now it'll fail to work without the log4j 1.2 api. The log4j-over-slf4j bridge ought to work, +when using the java client. As should log4j 2's log4j-1.2-api. The Elasticsearch server now only supports log4j as, +configured by logging.yml and it no longer makes any effort to work if log4j isn't present., +]
