[+++ b/docs/reference/setup/bootstrap-checks.asciidoc, +=== Max file size check, +, +The segment files that are the components of individual shards and the translog, +generations that are components of the translog can get large (exceeding, +multiple gigabytes). On systems where the max size of files that can be created, +by the Elasticsearch process is limited, this can lead to failed, +writes. Therefore, the safest option here is that the max file size is unlimited, +and that is what the max file size bootstrap check enforces. To pass the max, +file check, you must configure your system to allow the Elasticsearch process, +the ability to write files of unlimited size. This can be done via, +`/etc/security/limits.conf` using the `fsize` setting to `unlimited` (note that, +you might have to increase the limits for the `root` user too)., +]
