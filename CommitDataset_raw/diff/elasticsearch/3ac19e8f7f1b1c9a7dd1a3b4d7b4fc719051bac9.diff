[+++ b/docs/reference/testing/testing-framework.asciidoc, +In case you only need to execute a unit test, because your implementation can be isolated that well and does not require an up and running elasticsearch cluster, you can use the `ElasticsearchTestCase`. If you are testing lucene features, use `ElasticsearchLuceneTestCase` and if you are testing concrete token streams, use the `ElasticsearchTokenStreamTestCase` class. Those specific classes execute additional checks, which ensure that no resources leaks are happening, after the test has run.]
