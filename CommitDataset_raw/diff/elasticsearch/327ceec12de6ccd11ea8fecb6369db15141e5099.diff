It will try to bind, +to both 127.0.0.1 (IPv4) and [::1] (IPv6), but will work happily in, +environments where only IPv4 or IPv6 is available. This change prevents, +Elasticsearch from trying to connect to other nodes on your network unless you, +specifically tell it to do so. When moving to production you should configure, +the `network.host` parameter, either in the `elasticsearch.yml` config file or, +on the command line:, +, +[source,sh], +--------------------, +bin/elasticsearch --network.host 192.168.1.5, +bin/elasticsearch --network.host _non_loopback_, +--------------------, +, +The full list of options that network.host accepts can be found in the <<modules-network>>., +, +==== Multicast removed, +, +Multicast has been removed (although it is still, +{plugins}/discovery-multicast.html[provided as a plugin] for now). Instead,, +and only when bound to localhost, Elasticsearch will use unicast to contact, +the first 5 ports in the `transport.tcp.port` range, which defaults to, +`9300-9400`., +, +This preserves the zero-config auto-clustering experience for the developer,, +but it means that you will have to provide a list of <<unicast,unicast hosts>>, +when moving to production, for instance:, +, +[source,yaml], +---------------------, +discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: [ 192.168.1.2,  192.168.1.3 ], +---------------------, +, +You donâ€™t need to list all of the nodes in your cluster as unicast hosts, but, +you should specify at least a quorum (majority) of master-eligible nodes. A, +big cluster will typically have three dedicated master nodes, in which case we, +recommend listing all three of them as unicast hosts., +]
