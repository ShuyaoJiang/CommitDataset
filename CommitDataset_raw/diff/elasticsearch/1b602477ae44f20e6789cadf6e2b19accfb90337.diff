[+++ b/docs/reference/modules/network.asciidoc, +The publish host is the single interface that the node advertises to other nodes, +in the cluster, so that those nodes can connect to it. Currently an, +Elasticsearch node may be bound to multiple addresses, but only publishes one., +If not specified, this defaults to the ``best'' address from `network.host`,, +sorted by IPv4/IPv6 stack preference, then by reachability. If you set a, +`network.host` that results in multiple bind addresses yet rely on a specific, +address for node-to-node communication, you should explicitly set, +`network.publish_host`.]
