[+++ b/docs/reference/query-dsl/simple-query-string-query.asciidoc, +Be aware that this syntax may have a different behavior depending on the, +`default_operator` value. For example, consider the following query:, +, +[source,js], +--------------------------------------------------, +GET /_search, +{, +    "query": {, +        "simple_query_string" : {, +            "fields" : ["content"],, +            "query" : "foo bar -baz", +        }, +    }, +}, +--------------------------------------------------, +// CONSOLE, +, +You may expect that documents containing only "foo" or "bar" will be returned,, +as long as they do not contain "baz", however, due to the `default_operator`, +being OR, this really means "match documents that contain "foo" or documents, +that contain "bar", or documents that don't contain "baz". If this is unintended, +then the query can be switched to `"foo bar +-baz"` which will not return, +documents that contain "baz"., +]
