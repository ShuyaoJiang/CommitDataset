Since, +JSON doesn't allow to distinguish a `long` from an `integer` or a `double` from, +a `float`, it will always choose the wider datatype, ie. `long` for integers, +and `double` for floating-point numbers., +, +The following datatypes may be automatically detected:, +, + - `boolean` when `true` or `false` are encountered., + - `date` when <<date-detection,date detection>> is enabled and a string is, +   found that matches any of the configured date formats., + - `double` for numbers with a decimal part., + - `long` for numbers without a decimal part., + - `object` for objects, also called hashes., + - `string` for character strings., +, +`*` may also be used in order to match all datatypes.]
