[+++ b/docs/reference/modules/discovery/zen.asciidoc, +, +[float], +==== Cluster state updates, +, +The master node is the only node in a cluster that can make changes to the, +cluster state. The master node processes one cluster state update at a time,, +applies the required changes and publishes the updated cluster state to all, +the other nodes in the cluster. Each node receives the publish message,, +updates its own cluster state and replies to the master node, which waits for, +all nodes to respond, up to a timeout, before going ahead processing the next, +updates in the queue. The `discovery.zen.publish_timeout` is set by default, +to 30 seconds and can be changed dynamically through the, +<<cluster-update-settings,cluster update settings api>>.]
