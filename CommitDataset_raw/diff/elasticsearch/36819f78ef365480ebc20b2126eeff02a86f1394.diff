[+++ b/x-pack/docs/en/security/auditing/event-types.asciidoc, +multiple audit events., +, +The following is a list of the events that can be generated:, +In 6.5.0, there is a new <<audit-log-output, `logfile` audit output>> format., +This format also brings in a few changes for audit event attributes., +, +The new format is output to the `<clustername>_audit.log` file., +The audit entries are formatted as flat JSON documents (that is to say, no, +nested objects), one per line. Hence, the attribute names are JSON keys and they, +follow a dotted name syntax. Any attributes that lack a value (`null`) are not, +output., +, +The following list shows attributes that are common to all audit events., +Their names and values are analogous to those in the deprecated `logfile` or, +`index` output formats. However, it is expected that the formats will evolve, +independently during the 6.x releases, so it is advisable to follow the attribute, +descriptions for the format that you are using., +, +`@timestamp`      ::    The time, in ISO9601 format, when the event occurred., +`node.name`       ::    The name of the node. This can be changed, +                        in the `elasticsearch.yml` config file., +`node.id`         ::    The node id. This is automatically generated and is, +                        persistent across full cluster restarts., +`host.ip`         ::    The bound IP address of the node, with which the node, +                        can be communicated with., +`host.name`       ::    The unresolved node's hostname., +`origin.address`  ::    The source IP address of the request associated with, +                        this event. This could be the address of the remote client,, +                        the address of another cluster node, or the local node's, +                        bound address, if the request originated locally. Unless, +                        the remote client connects directly to the cluster, the, +                        _client  address_ will actually be the address of the first, +                        OSI layer 3 proxy in front of the cluster., +`origin.type`     ::    The origin type of the request associated with this event:, +                        `rest` (request originated from a REST API request),, +                        `transport` (request was received on the transport channel),, +                        or `local_node` (the local node issued the request)., +`event.type`      ::    The internal processing layer that generated the event:, +                        `rest`, `transport` or `ip_filter`., +                        This is different from `origin.type` because a request, +                        originating from the REST API is translated to a number, +                        of transport messages, generating audit events with, +                        `origin.type: rest` and `event.type: transport`., +`event.action`    ::    The type of event that occurred: `anonymous_access_denied`,, +                        `authentication_failed`, `authentication_success`,, +                        `realm_authentication_failed`, `access_denied`, `access_granted`,, +                        `connection_denied`, `connection_granted`, `tampered_request`,, +                        `run_as_denied`, or `run_as_granted`., +`opaque_id`       ::    The value of the `X-Opaque-Id` HTTP header (if present) of, +                        the request associated with this event. This header can, +                        be used freely by the client to mark API calls, as it has, +                        no semantics in Elasticsearch., +, +==== Audit event attributes of the REST event type, +, +The events with `event.type` equal to `rest` have one of the following `event.action`, +attribute values: `authentication_success`, `anonymous_access_denied`, `authentication_failed`,, +`realm_authentication_failed`, `tampered_request` or `run_as_denied`., +These event types also have the following extra attributes (in addition to the, +common ones):, +, +`url.path`        ::    The path part of the URL (between the port and the query, +                        string) of the REST request associated with this event., +                        This is URL encoded., +`url.query`       ::    The query part of the URL (after "?", if present) of the, +                        REST request associated with this event. This is URL encoded., +`request.body`    ::    The full content of the REST request associated with this, +                        event, if enabled. This contains the query body. The body, +                        is escaped according to the JSON RFC 4627., +, +==== Audit event attributes of the transport event type, +, +The events with `event.type` equal to `transport` have one of the following `event.action`, +attribute values: `authentication_success`, `anonymous_access_denied`, `authentication_failed`,, +`realm_authentication_failed`, `access_granted`, `access_denied`, `run_as_granted`,, +`run_as_denied`, or `tampered_request`., +These event types also have the following extra attributes (in addition to the common, +ones):, +, +`action`              ::    The name of the transport action that was executed., +                            This is like the URL for a REST request., +`indices`             ::    The indices names array that the request associated, +                            with this event pertains to (when applicable)., +`request.name`        ::    The name of the request handler that was executed., +, +==== Audit event attributes of the ip_filter event type, +, +The events with `event.type` equal to `ip_filter` have one of the following `event.action`, +attribute values: `connection_granted` or `connection_denied`., +These event types also have the following extra attributes (in addition to the common, +ones):, +, +`transport_profile`   ::    The transport profile the request targeted., +`rule`                ::    The <<ip-filtering, IP filtering>> rule that denied, +                            the request., +, +==== Extra audit event attributes for specific events, +, +There are a few events that have some more attributes in addition to those]
