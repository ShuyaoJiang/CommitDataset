While elasticsearch will optimize the search execution, +on the coordinating node a large number of shards can have a significant impact, +CPU and memory wise. It is usually a better idea to organize data in such a way, +that there are fewer larger shards. In case you would like to configure a soft, +limit, you can update the `action.search.shard_count.limit` cluster setting in order, +to reject search requests that hit too many shards.]
