[+++ b/core/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/plugins/Plugin.java, + * An extension point allowing to plug in custom functionality. This class has a number of extension points that are available to all, + * plugins, in addition you can implement any of the following interfaces to further customize Elasticsearch:, + * <li>{@link ClusterPlugin}, + * <li>{@link DiscoveryPlugin}, + * <li>{@link IngestPlugin}, + * <li>{@link NetworkPlugin}, + * <li>{@link RepositoryPlugin}, + * <p>In addition to extension points this class also declares some {@code @Deprecated} {@code public final void onModule} methods. These, + * methods should cause any extensions of {@linkplain Plugin} that used the pre-5.x style extension syntax to fail to build and point the, + * plugin author at the new extension syntax.
