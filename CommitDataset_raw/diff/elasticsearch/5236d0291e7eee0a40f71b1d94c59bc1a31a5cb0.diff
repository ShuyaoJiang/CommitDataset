[+++ b/docs/reference/docs/reindex.asciidoc, +=== Reindexing many indices, +If you have many indices to reindex it is generally better to reindex them, +one at a time rather than using a glob pattern to pick up many indices. That, +way you can resume the process if there are any errors by removing the, +partially completed index and starting over at that index. It also makes, +parallelizing the process fairly simple: split the list of indices to reindex, +and run each list in parallel., +, +One off bash scripts seem to work nicely for this:, +, +[source,bash], +----------------------------------------------------------------, +for index in i1 i2 i3 i4 i5; do, +  curl -HContent-Type:application/json -XPOST localhost:9200/_reindex?pretty -d'{, +    "source": {, +      "index": "'$index'", +    },, +    "dest": {, +      "index": "'$index'-reindexed", +    }, +  }', +done, +----------------------------------------------------------------, +// NOTCONSOLE, +, +[float], +Notwithstanding the above advice, you can use `_reindex` in combination with, +<<modules-scripting-painless, Painless>> to reindex daily indices to apply, +a new template to the existing documents.]
