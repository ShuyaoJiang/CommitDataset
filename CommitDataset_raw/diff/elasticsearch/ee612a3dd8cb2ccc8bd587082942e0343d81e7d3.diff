Before you run it, however, you, +must edit the USERNAME and PASSWORD variables with your actual user ID and, +password. If you want to test adding data to an existing data feed, you must, +also comment out the final two commands related to `server-metrics_4.json`., +, +The script runs a command similar, +actual password., +example, which loads three of the JSON files:, +//curl -u elastic:elasticpassword -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json", +//http://localhost:9200/server-metrics/_bulk --data-binary "@server-metrics_4.json", +For three sample JSON files, you should see output similar to the following:, +green  open   server-metrics ... 1 0 680400  0 101.7mb  ..., +. Click **Use full transaction_counts data**.

In the **Machine Learning** / **Job Management** tab, click the following, +button to start the data feed: image::images/ml-start-feed.jpg["Start data feed"]., +, +. Choose a start time and end time. For example,, +click **Continue from 2017-04-22** and **No end time**, then click **Start**., +image::images/ml-gs-job1-datafeed.jpg["Restarting a data feed"], +, +* TBD: Why do I not see increases in the job count stats after this occurs?, +How can I determine that it has been successfully processed?, +The {xpack} {ml} features analyze the input stream of data, model its behavior,, +and perform analysis based on the detectors you defined in your job. When an, +event occurs outside of the model, that event is identified as an anomaly., +, +Result records for each anomaly are stored in `.ml-notifications` and, +`.ml-anomalies*` indices in Elasticsearch. By default, the name of the, +index where {ml} results are stored is `shared`, which corresponds to, +the `.ml-anomalies-shared` index., +//For example, these results include the probability of detecting that anomaly., +, +You can use the **Anomaly Explorer** or the, +  This view contains heatmap charts, where the color for each section of the, +  timeline is determined by the maximum anomaly score in that period., +//TBD: Do the time periods in the heat map correspond to buckets?, +  This view contains a time series chart that represents the analysis., +  As in the **Anomaly Explorer**, anomalous data points are shown in, +  different colors depending on their probability., +By default when you view the results for a single metric job,, +the **Single Metric Viewer** opens:, +The blue line in the chart represents the actual data values. The shaded blue area, +represents the expected behavior that was calculated by the model., +//TBD: What is meant by "95% prediction bounds"?, +, +If you slide the time selector from the beginning of the data to the end of the, +data, you can see how the model improves as it processes more data. At the, +beginning, the expected range of values is pretty broad and the model is not, +capturing the periodicity in the data. But it quickly learns and begins to, +reflect the daily variation.]
