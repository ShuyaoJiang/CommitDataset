The plugin is a simple zip file that can be downloaded and placed under `$ES_HOME/plugins` location. It will be automatically detected and the `attachment` type will be added., +Using the attachment type is simple, in your mapping JSON, simply set a certain JSON element as attachment, for example:, +    "person" : {, +        "properties" : {, +            "my_attachment" : { "type" : "attachment" }, +In this case, the JSON to index can be:, +    "my_attachment" : "... base64 encoded attachment ...", +}, +```, +, +Or it is possible to use more elaborated JSON if content type or resource name need to be set explicitly:, +, +```javascript, +    "my_attachment" : {, +        "_content_type" : "application/pdf",, +        "_name" : "resource/name/of/my.pdf",, +        "content" : "... base64 encoded attachment ...", +    }, +}, +```, +, +The `attachment` type not only indexes the content of the doc, but also automatically adds meta data on the attachment as well (when available)., +, +The metadata supported are:, +, +* `date`, +* `title`, +* `name` only available if you set `_name` see above, +* `author`, +* `keywords`, +* `content_type`, +* `content_length` is the original content_length before text extraction (aka file size), +, +They can be queried using the "dot notation", for example: `my_attachment.author`., +, +Both the meta data and the actual content are simple core type mappers (string, date, ...), thus, they can be controlled in the mappings. For example:, +, +```javascript, +{, +    "person" : {, +        "properties" : {, +            "file" : {, +                "type" : "attachment",, +                    "file" : {"index" : "no"},, +                    "title" : {store : "yes"},, +                    "date" : {"store" : "yes"},, +                    "author" : {"analyzer" : "myAnalyzer"},, +                    "keywords" : {store : "yes"},, +                    "content_type" : {store : "yes"},, +                    "content_length" : {store : "yes"}, +        }, +    }, +In the above example, the actual content indexed is mapped under `fields` name `file`, and we decide not to index it, so it will only be available in the `_all` field. The other fields map to their respective metadata names, but there is no need to specify the `type` (like `string` or `date`) since it is already known., +, +Indexed Characters, +------------------, +, +By default, `100000` characters are extracted when indexing the content. This default value can be changed by setting the `index.mapping.attachment.indexed_chars` setting. It can also be provided on a per document indexed using the `_indexed_chars` parameter. `-1` can be set to extract all text, but note that all the text needs to be allowed to be represented in memory., +, +Note, this feature is support since `1.3.0` version., +, +Metadata parsing error handling, +-------------------------------, +, +While extracting metadata content, errors could happen for example when parsing dates., +Since version `1.9.0`, parsing errors are ignored so your document is indexed., +, +You can disable this feature by setting the `index.mapping.attachment.ignore_errors` setting to `false`., +++ b/.gitignore, +/.classpath, +++ b/CONTRIBUTING.md, +**Repository:** [https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-mapper-attachments](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-mapper-attachments), +cd elasticsearch-mapper-attachments/, +++ b/README.md, +Mapper Attachments Type for Elasticsearch]
