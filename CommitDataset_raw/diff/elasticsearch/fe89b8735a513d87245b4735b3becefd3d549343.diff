[+++ b/docs/reference/getting-started.asciidoc, +To understand filters, let's first introduce the http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-filtered-query.html[`filtered` query], which allows you to combine a query (like `match_all`, `match`, `bool`, etc.) together with a filter. As an example, let's introduce the http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-range-filter.html[`range` filter], which allows us to filter documents by a range of values. This is generally used for numeric or date filtering., +In addition to the `match_all`, `match`, `bool`, `filtered`, and `range` queries, there are a lot of other query/filter types that are available and we won't go into them here. Since we already have a basic understanding of how they work, it shouldn't be too difficult to apply this knowledge in learning and experimenting with the other query/filter types.]
