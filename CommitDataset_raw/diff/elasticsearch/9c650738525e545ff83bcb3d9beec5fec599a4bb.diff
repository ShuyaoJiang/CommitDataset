[+++ b/docs/plugins/repository-hdfs.asciidoc, +[[repository-hdfs-availability]], +[float], +===== A Note on HDFS Availablility, +When you initialize a repository, its settings are persisted in the cluster state. When a node comes online, it will, +attempt to initialize all repositories for which it has settings. If your cluster has an HDFS repository configured, then, +all nodes in the cluster must be able to reach HDFS when starting. If not, then the node will fail to initialize the, +repository at start up and the repository will be unusable. If this happens, you will need to remove and re-add the, +repository or restart the offending node., +]
