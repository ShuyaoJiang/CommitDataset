[+++ b/docs/reference/query-dsl/filters.asciidoc, +However the cost of caching is not the same for all filters. For, +instance some filters are already fast out of the box while caching could, +add significant overhead, and some filters produce results that are already, +cacheable so caching them is just a matter of putting the result in the, +cache., +, +The default caching policy, `_cache: auto`, tracks the 1000 most recently, +used filters on a per-index basis and makes decisions based on their, +frequency., +, +[float], +==== Filters that read directly the index structure, +, +Some filters can directly read the index structure and potentially jump, +over large sequences of documents that are not worth evaluating (for, +instance when these documents do not match the query). Caching these, +filters introduces overhead given that all documents that the filter, +matches need to be consumed in order to be loaded into the cache., +, +These filters, which include the <<query-dsl-term-filter,term>> and, +<<query-dsl-term-query,query>> filters, are only cached after they, +appear 5 times or more in the history of the 1000 most recently used, +filters., +, +[float], +==== Filters that produce results that are already cacheable, +, +Some filters produce results that are already cacheable, and the difference, +between caching and not caching them is the act of placing the result in, +the cache or not. These filters, which include the, +<<query-dsl-range-filter,range>> filters, are by default cached after they, +appear twice or more in the history of the most 1000 recently used filters., +[float], +==== Computational filters, +Some filters need to run some computation in order to figure out whether, +a given document matches a filter. These filters, which include the geo and, +<<query-dsl-script-filter,script>> filters, but also the, +<<query-dsl-terms-filter,terms>>  and <<query-dsl-range-filter,range>>, +filters when using the `fielddata` execution mode are never cached by default,, +as it would require to evaluate the filter on all documents in your indices, +while they can otherwise be only evaluated on documents that match the query., +, +[float], +==== Compound filters, +, +The last type of filters are those working with other filters, and includes, +the <<query-dsl-bool-filter,bool>>,, +<<query-dsl-or-filter,or>> filters., +, +There is no general rule about these filters. Depending on the filters that, +they wrap, they will sometimes return a filter that dynamically evaluates the, +sub filters and sometimes evaluate the sub filters eagerly in order to return, +a result that is already cacheable, so depending on the case, these filters, +will be cached after they appear 2+ or 5+ times in the history of the most, +1000 recently used filters., +, +[float], +==== Overriding the default behaviour, +to cache it and how often it has been used as explained above.]
