The first three, namely `SELECT`, `*` and `FROM` are __key words__ meaning words that have a fixed meaning in SQL. The token `table` is an _identifier_ meaning it identifies (by name) an entity inside SQL such as a table (in this case), a column, etc..., +This query has two identifiers, `ip_address` and `hosts-*` (an <<multi-index,index pattern>>). As `ip_address` does not clash with any key words it can be used verbatim, `hosts-*` on the other hand cannot as it clashes with `-` (minus operation) and `*` hence the double quotes., +Multi line:: Comments that start with `/*` and end with `*/` (also known as C-style). ]
