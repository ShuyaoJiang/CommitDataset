[+++ b/docs/reference/how-to/indexing-speed.asciidoc, +=== Unset or increase the refresh interval, +The operation that consists of making changes visible to search - called a, +<<indices-refresh,refresh>> - is costly, and calling it often while there is, +ongoing indexing activity can hurt indexing speed., +, +By default, Elasticsearch runs this operation every second, but only on, +indices that have received one search request or more in the last 30 seconds., +This is the optimal configuration if you have no or very little search traffic, +(e.g. less than one search request every 5 minutes) and want to optimize for, +indexing speed., +, +On the other hand, if your index experiences regular search requests, this, +default behavior means that Elasticsearch will refresh your index every 1, +second. If you can afford to increase the amount of time between when a document, +gets indexed and when it becomes visible, increasing the, +<<dynamic-index-settings,`index.refresh_interval`>> to a larger value, e.g., +`30s`, might help improve indexing speed.]
