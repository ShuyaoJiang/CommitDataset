[+++ b/docs/reference/query-dsl/geo-bounding-box-query.asciidoc, +, +[float], +==== Notes on Precision, +, +Geopoints have limited precision and are always rounded down during index time., +During the query time, upper boundaries of the bounding boxes are rounded down,, +while lower boundaries are rounded up. As a result, the points along on the, +lower bounds (bottom and left edges of the bounding box) might not make it into, +the bounding box due to the rounding error. At the same time points alongside, +the upper bounds (top and right edges) might be selected by the query even if, +they are located slightly outside the edge. The rounding error should be less, +than 4.20e-8 degrees on the latitude and less than 8.39e-8 degrees on the, +longitude, which translates to less than 1cm error even at the equator.]
