[+++ b/CONTRIBUTING.md, +IDEA 2017.2 and above, it is required to disable the IDEA run launcher in order to avoid, +`idea_rt.jar` causing "jar hell". This can be achieved by adding the, +option](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/articles/206544869-Configuring-JVM-options-and-platform-properties)., +Alternatively, `idea.no.launcher=true` can be set in the, +file which can be accessed under Help > Edit Custom Properties (this will require a, +restart of IDEA). For IDEA 2017.3 and above, in addition to the JVM option, you will need to go to, +`Run->Edit Configurations...` and change the value for the `Shorten command line` setting from, +`user-local default: none` to `classpath file`. You may also need to [remove `ant-javafx.jar` from your, +reported as a source of jar hell.]
