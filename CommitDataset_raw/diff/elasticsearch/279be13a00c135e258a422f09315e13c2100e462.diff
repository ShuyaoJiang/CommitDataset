[+++ b/docs/reference/setup/bootstrap-checks.asciidoc, +By default, Elasticsearch binds to `localhost` for <<modules-http,HTTP>> and, +<<modules-transport,transport (internal)>> communication. This is fine for, +downloading and playing with Elasticsearch, and everyday development but it's, +useless for production systems. To join a cluster, an Elasticsearch node must be, +reachable via transport communication. To join a cluster over an external, +network interface, a node must bind transport to an external interface and not, +be using <<single-node-discovery,single-node discovery>>. Thus, we consider an, +Elasticsearch node to be in development mode if it can not form a cluster with, +another machine over an external network interface, and is otherwise in, +production mode if it can join a cluster over an external interface., +Note that HTTP and transport can be configured independently via, +<<modules-http,`http.host`>> and <<modules-transport,`transport.host`>>; this, +can be useful for configuring a single node to be reachable via HTTP for testing, +purposes without triggering production mode., +[[single-node-discovery]], +[float], +=== Single-node discovery, +We recognize that some users need to bind transport to an external interface for, +testing their usage of the transport client. For this situation, we provide the, +discovery type `single-node` (configure it by setting `discovery.type` to, +`single-node`); in this situation, a node will elect itself master and will not, +join a cluster with any other node., +, +[float], +=== Forcing the bootstrap checks, +If you are running a single node in production, it is possible to evade the, +bootstrap checks (either by not binding transport to an external interface, or, +by binding transport to an external interface and setting the discovery type to, +`single-node`). For this situation, you can force execution of the bootstrap, +checks by setting the system property `es.enforce.bootstrap.checks` to `true`, +(set this in <<jvm-options>>, or by adding `-Des.enforce.bootstrap.checks=true`, +to the environment variable `ES_JAVA_OPTS`). We strongly encourage you to do, +this if you are in this specific situation. This system property can be used to, +force execution of the bootstrap checks independent of the node configuration.]
