[+++ b/docs/resiliency/index.asciidoc, +[float], +=== Replicas can fall out of sync when a primary shard fails (STATUS: ONGOING), +, +When a primary shard fails, a replica shard will be promoted to be the, +primary shard. If there is more than one replica shard, it is possible, +for the remaining replicas to be out of sync with the new primary, +shard. This is caused by operations that were in-flight when the primary, +shard failed and may not have been processed on all replica, +shards. Currently, the discrepancies are not repaired on primary, +promotion but instead would be repaired if replica shards are relocated, +(e.g., from hot to cold nodes); this does mean that the length of time, +which replicas can be out of sync with the primary shard is, +unbounded. Sequence numbers {GIT}10708[#10708] will provide a mechanism, +for syncing the remaining replicas with the newly-promoted primary, +shard.]
