[+++ b/docs/reference/mapping/types/geo-shape.asciidoc, +|`tree` |deprecated[6.6, PrefixTrees no longer used] Name of the PrefixTree, +*IMPORTANT NOTES*, +, +The following features are not yet supported with the new indexing approach:, +, +* `geo_shape` query with `MultiPoint` geometry types - Elasticsearch currently prevents searching, +   geo_shape fields with a MultiPoint geometry type to avoid a brute force linear search, +   over each individual point. For now, if this is absolutely needed, this can be achieved, +   using a `bool` query with each individual point., +, +* `CONTAINS` relation query - when using the new default vector indexing strategy, `geo_shape`, +   queries with `relation` defined as `contains` are not yet supported. If this query relation, +   is an absolute necessity, it is recommended to set `strategy` to `quadtree` and use the, +   deprecated PrefixTree strategy indexing approach., +]
