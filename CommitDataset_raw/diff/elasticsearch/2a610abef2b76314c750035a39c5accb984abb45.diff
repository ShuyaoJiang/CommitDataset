[+++ b/docs/reference/docs/index_.asciidoc, +The index operation automatically creates an index if it does not already, +exist, and applies any <<indices-templates,index templates>> that are, +configured. The index operation also creates a dynamic mapping if one does not, +already exist. By default, new fields and objects will automatically be added, +to the mapping definition if needed. Check out the <<mapping,mapping>> section, +for more information on mapping definitions, and the the, +<<indices-put-mapping,put mapping>> API for information about updating mappings, +manually., +Automatic index creation is controlled by the `action.auto_create_index`, +setting. This setting defaults to `true`, meaning that indices are always, +automatically created. Automatic index creation can be permitted only for, +indices matching certain patterns by changing the value of this setting to a, +comma-separated list of these patterns. It can also be explicitly permitted and, +forbidden by prefixing patterns in the list with a `+` or `-`.  Finally it can, +be completely disabled by changing this setting to `false`., +[source,js], +--------------------------------------------------, +PUT _cluster/settings, +{, +    "persistent": {, +        "action.auto_create_index": "twitter,index10,-index1*,+ind*" <1>, +    }, +}, +PUT _cluster/settings, +{, +    "persistent": {, +        "action.auto_create_index": "false" <2>, +    }, +}, +PUT _cluster/settings, +{, +    "persistent": {, +        "action.auto_create_index": "true" <3>, +    }, +}, +--------------------------------------------------, +// CONSOLE, +, +<1> Permit only the auto-creation of indices called `twitter`, `index10`, no, +other index matching `index1*`, and any other index matching `ind*`.
