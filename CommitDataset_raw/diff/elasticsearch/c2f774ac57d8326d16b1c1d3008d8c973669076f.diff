[+++ b/docs/reference/aggregations/bucket/histogram-aggregation.asciidoc, +WARNING: Currently, values are cast to integers before being bucketed, which, +might cause negative floating-point values to fall into the wrong bucket. For, +instance, `-4.5` with an interval of `2` would be cast to `-4`, and so would, +end up in the `-4 <= val < -2` bucket instead of the `-6 <= val < -4` bucket., +]
