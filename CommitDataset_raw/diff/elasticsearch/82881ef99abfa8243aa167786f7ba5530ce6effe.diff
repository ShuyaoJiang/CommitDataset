[+++ b/docs/reference/getting-started.asciidoc, +Also from the above response, we can see a total of 1 node and that we have 0 shards since we have no data in it yet. Note that since we are using the default cluster name (elasticsearch) and since Elasticsearch uses unicast network discovery by default to find other nodes on the same machine, it is possible that you could accidentally start up more than one node on your computer and have them all join a single cluster. In this scenario, you may see more than 1 node in the above response.]
