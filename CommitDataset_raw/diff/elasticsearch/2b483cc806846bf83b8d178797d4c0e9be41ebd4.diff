Application developers should, +# consult the guide at <http://elasticsearch.org/guide>., +# The installation procedure is covered at, +# <http://elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup.html>., +# Elasticsearch comes with reasonable defaults for most settings,, +# so you can try it out without bothering with configuration., +# Most of the time, these defaults are just fine for running a production, +# cluster. If you're fine-tuning your cluster, or wondering about the, +# effect of certain configuration option, please _do ask_ on the, +# mailing list or IRC channel [http://elasticsearch.org/community]., +, +# Any element in the configuration can be replaced with environment variables, +# by placing them in ${...} notation. For example:, +#node.rack: ${RACK_ENV_VAR}, +, +# For information on supported formats and syntax for the config file, see, +# <http://elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-configuration.html>, +, +, +################################### Cluster ###################################, +, +# Cluster name identifies your cluster for auto-discovery. If you're running, +# multiple clusters on the same network, make sure you're using unique names., +#cluster.name: elasticsearch, +, +, +#################################### Node #####################################, +, +# Node names are generated dynamically on startup, so you're relieved, +# from configuring them manually. You can tie this node to a specific name:, +#node.name: "Franz Kafka", +, +# Every node can be configured to allow or deny being eligible as the master,, +# and to allow or deny to store the data., +# Allow this node to be eligible as a master node (enabled by default):, +#node.master: true, +# Allow this node to store data (enabled by default):, +#node.data: true, +, +# You can exploit these settings to design advanced cluster topologies., +# 1. You want this node to never become a master node, only to hold data., +#    This will be the "workhorse" of your cluster., +#node.master: false, +#node.data: true, +# 2. You want this node to only serve as a master: to not store any data and, +#    to have free resources. This will be the "coordinator" of your cluster., +#, +#node.master: true, +#node.data: false, +#, +# 3. You want this node to be neither master nor data node, but, +#    to act as a "search load balancer" (fetching data from nodes,, +#    aggregating results, etc.), +#, +#node.master: false, +#node.data: false, +, +# Use the Cluster Health API [http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health], the, +# Node Info API [http://localhost:9200/_nodes] or GUI tools, +# such as <http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/marvel/>,, +# <http://github.com/karmi/elasticsearch-paramedic>,, +# <http://github.com/lukas-vlcek/bigdesk> and, +# <http://mobz.github.com/elasticsearch-head> to inspect the cluster state., +, +# A node can have generic attributes associated with it, which can later be used, +# for customized shard allocation filtering, or allocation awareness. An attribute, +# is a simple key value pair, similar to node.key: value, here is an example:, +#, +#node.rack: rack314, +, +# By default, multiple nodes are allowed to start from the same installation location, +# to disable it, set the following:, +#node.max_local_storage_nodes: 1, +, +, +#################################### Index ####################################, +, +# You can set a number of options (such as shard/replica options, mapping, +# or analyzer definitions, translog settings, ...) for indices globally,, +# in this file., +#, +# Note, that it makes more sense to configure index settings specifically for, +# a certain index, either when creating it or by using the index templates API., +#, +# See <http://elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-modules.html> and, +# <http://elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-create-index.html>, +# for more information., +, +# Set the number of shards (splits) of an index (5 by default):, +#, +#index.number_of_shards: 5, +, +# Set the number of replicas (additional copies) of an index (1 by default):, +#]
