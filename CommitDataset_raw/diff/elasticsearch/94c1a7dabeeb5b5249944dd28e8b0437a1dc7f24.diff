[+++ b/docs/reference/mapping/dynamic-mapping.asciidoc, +Queries and filters can refer to fields that don't exist in a mapping. Whether this, +is allowed is controlled by the `index.query.parse.allow_unmapped_fields` setting., +This setting defaults to `true`. Setting it to `false` will disallow the usage of, +unmapped fields in queries., +When registering a new <<search-percolate,percolator query>> or creating, +a <<filtered,filtered alias>> then the `index.query.parse.allow_unmapped_fields` setting, +is forcefully overwritten to disallowed unmapped fields.]
