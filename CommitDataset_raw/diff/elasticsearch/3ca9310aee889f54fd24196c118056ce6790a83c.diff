[+++ b/docs/reference/mapping/types/geo-shape.asciidoc, +*IMPORTANT NOTE:* WKT does not enforce a specific order for vertices thus, +ambiguous polygons around the dateline and poles are possible., +https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.1.6[GeoJSON] mandates that the, +outer polygon must be counterclockwise and interior shapes must be clockwise,, +which agrees with the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), +http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfa[Simple Feature Access], +specification for vertex ordering., +Elasticsearch accepts both clockwise and counterclockwise polygons if they, +appear not to cross the dateline (i.e. they cross less than 180° of longitude),, +but for polygons that do cross the dateline (or for other polygons wider than, +180°) Elasticsearch requires the vertex ordering to comply with the OGC and, +GeoJSON specifications. Otherwise, an unintended polygon may be created and, +unexpected query/filter results will be returned., +The following provides an example of an ambiguous polygon.  Elasticsearch will, +apply the GeoJSON standard to eliminate ambiguity resulting in a polygon that, +crosses the dateline.]
