[+++ b/docs/reference/search/aggregations/bucket/significantterms-aggregation.asciidoc, +, +There are different mechanisms by which terms aggregations can be executed:, +, + - by using field values directly in order to aggregate data per-bucket (`map`), + - by using ordinals of the field and preemptively allocating one bucket per ordinal value (`global_ordinals`), + - by using ordinals of the field and dynamically allocating one bucket per ordinal value (`global_ordinals_hash`), + , +Elasticsearch tries to have sensible defaults so this is something that generally doesn't need to be configured., +, +`map` should only be considered when very few documents match a query. Otherwise the ordinals-based execution modes, +are significantly faster. By default, `map` is only used when running an aggregation on scripts, since they don't have, +ordinals., +, +`global_ordinals` is the second fastest option, but the fact that it preemptively allocates buckets can be memory-intensive,, +especially if you have one or more sub aggregations. It is used by default on top-level terms aggregations., +, +`global_ordinals_hash` on the contrary to `global_ordinals` and `global_ordinals_low_cardinality` allocates buckets dynamically, +so memory usage is linear to the number of values of the documents that are part of the aggregation scope. It is used by default, +in inner aggregations., +, +<1> the possible values are `map`, `global_ordinals` and `global_ordinals_hash`, +]
