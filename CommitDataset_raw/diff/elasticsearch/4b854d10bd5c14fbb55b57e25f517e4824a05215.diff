This can be useful to explore a dataset which, +you don't know much about. For example, this allows creating a histogram, +aggregation with meaningful intervals based on the min/max range of values., +The field stats api by defaults executes on all indices, but can execute on, +specific indices too., +`fields`::  A list of fields to compute stats for., +`level`::   Defines if field stats should be returned on a per index level or on a, +            cluster wide level. Valid values are `indices` and `cluster` (default)., +[float], +measurement isn't available on one or more shards., +Document frequency is the number of documents containing a particular term., +documents, or -1 if this measurement isn't available on one or more shards., +NOTE: Documents marked as deleted (but not yet removed by the merge process), +still affect all the mentioned statistics., +, +.Cluster level field statistics, +==================================================, +GET /_field_stats?fields=rating,answer_count,creation_date,display_name, +[source,json], +==================================================, +.Indices level field statistics, +==================================================, +GET /_field_stats?fields=rating,answer_count,creation_date,display_name&level=indices, +, +==================================================]
