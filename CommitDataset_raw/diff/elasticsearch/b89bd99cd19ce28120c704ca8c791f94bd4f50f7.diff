[+++ b/docs/resiliency/index.asciidoc, +Currently, the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index-modules-fielddata.html[circuit breaker] protects against loading too much field data by estimating how much memory the field data will take to load, then aborting the request if the memory requirements are too high. This feature was added in Elasticsearch version 1.0.0.]
