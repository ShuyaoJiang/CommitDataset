[+++ b/docs/plugins/plugin-script.asciidoc, +=== Batch mode, +, +Certain plugins require more privileges than those provided by default in core, +Elasticsearch. These plugins will list the required privileges and ask the, +user for confirmation before continuing with installation., +, +When running the plugin install script from another program (e.g. install, +automation scripts), the plugin script should detect that it is not being, +called from the console and skip the confirmation response, automatically, +granting all requested permissions.  If console detection fails, then batch, +mode can be forced by specifying `-b` or `--batch` as follows:, +, +[source,shell], +-----------------------------------, +sudo bin/elasticsearch-plugin install --batch [pluginname], +-----------------------------------, +, +[float]]
