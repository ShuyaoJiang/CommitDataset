[+++ b/docs/reference/search/request/script-fields.asciidoc, +Script fields can also access the actual `_source` document and, +extract specific elements to be returned from it by using `params._source`., +Here is an example:, +                "script" : "params['_source']['message']", +// TEST[setup:twitter], +`doc['my_field'].value` and `params['_source']['my_field']`. The first,, +using the doc keyword, will cause the terms for that field to be loaded to, +memory (cached), which will result in faster execution, but more memory, +non-analyzed or single term based fields.  However, using `doc` is, +still the recommended way to access values from the document, if at all, +possible, because `_source` must be loaded and parsed every time it's used., +Using `_source` is very slow.]
