See the <<java-rest-high-level-migration>>, +if you need to migrate an application from `TransportClient` to the new REST client., +The High Level Client is guaranteed to be able to communicate with any Elasticsearch, +node running on the same major version and greater or equal minor version. It, +doesn't need to be in the same minor version as the Elasticsearch nodes it, +communicates with, as it is forward compatible meaning that it supports, +communicating with later versions of Elasticsearch than the one it was developed for., +, +The 6.0 client is able to communicate with any 6.x Elasticsearch node, while the 6.1, +client is for sure able to communicate with 6.1, 6.2 and any later 6.x version, but, +there may be incompatibility issues when communicating with a previous Elasticsearch, +node version, for instance between 6.1 and 6.0, in case the 6.1 client supports new, +request body fields for some APIs that are not known by the 6.0 node(s)., +, +It is recommended to upgrade the High Level Client when upgrading the Elasticsearch, +cluster to a new major version, as REST API breaking changes may cause unexpected, +results depending on the node that is hit by the request, and newly added APIs will, +only be supported by the newer version of the client. The client should always be, +updated last, once all of the nodes in the cluster have been upgraded to the new, +major version.]
