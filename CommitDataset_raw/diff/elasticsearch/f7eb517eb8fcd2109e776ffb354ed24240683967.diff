[+++ b/docs/reference/indices/flush.asciidoc, +flush process of an index makes sure that any data that is currently only, +persisted in the <<index-modules-translog,transaction log>> is also permanently, +persisted in Lucene. This reduces recovery times as that data doesn't need to be, +reindexed from the transaction logs after the Lucene indexed is opened. By, +default, Elasticsearch uses heuristics in order to automatically, +trigger flushes as required. It is rare for users to need to call the API directly.]
