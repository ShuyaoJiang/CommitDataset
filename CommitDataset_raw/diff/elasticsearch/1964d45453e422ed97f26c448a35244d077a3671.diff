Imagine further that you are tasked with tweaking the, +Elasticsearch query that is being created to return specific results for a, +certain set of queries without breaking others. How should that be done?, +, +One possible solution is to gather a sample of user queries representative of, +how the search application is used, retrieve the search results that are being, +returned. As a next step these search results would be manually annotated for, +their relevancy to the original user query.
