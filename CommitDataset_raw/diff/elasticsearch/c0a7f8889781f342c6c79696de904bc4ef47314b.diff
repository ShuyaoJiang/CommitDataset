[+++ b/docs/reference/modules/node.asciidoc, +Any time that you start an instance of Elasticsearch, you are starting a, +_node_. A collection of connected nodes is  called a, +<<modules-cluster,cluster>>. If you are running a single node of Elasticsearch,, +then you have a cluster of one node., +Every node in the cluster can handle <<modules-http,HTTP>> and, +<<modules-transport,Transport>> traffic by default. The transport layer, +is used exclusively for communication between nodes and between nodes and the, +{javaclient}/transport-client.html[Java `TransportClient`]; the HTTP layer is, +used only by external REST clients., +All nodes know about all the other nodes in the cluster and can forward client, +requests to the appropriate node. Besides that, each node serves one or more, +purpose:, +<<master-node,Master-eligible node>>::, +A node that has `node.master` set to `true` (default), which makes it eligible, +to be <<modules-discovery-zen,elected as the _master_ node>>, which controls, +the cluster., +, +<<data-node,Data node>>::, +, +A node that has `node.data` set to `true` (default). Data nodes hold data and, +perform data related operations such as CRUD, search, and aggregations., +, +<<client-node,Client node>>::, +, +A client node has both `node.master` and `node.data` set to `false`. It can, +neither hold data nor become the master node.  It behaves as a ``smart, +router'' and is used to forward cluster-level requests to the master node and, +data-related requests (such as search) to the appropriate data nodes., +, +<<modules-tribe,Tribe node>>::, +, +A tribe node, configured via the `tribe.*` settings, is a special type  of, +client node that can connect to multiple clusters and perform search and other, +operations across all connected clusters., +, +By default a node is both a master-eligible node and a data node. This is very, +convenient for small clusters but, as the cluster grows, it becomes important, +to consider separating dedicated master-eligible nodes from dedicated data, +nodes., +, +[NOTE], +[[coordinating-node]], +.Coordinating node, +===============================================, +, +Requests like search requests or bulk-indexing requests may involve data held, +on different data nodes. A search request, for example, is executed in two, +phases which are coordinated by the node which receives the client request --, +the _coordinating node_., +, +In the _scatter_ phase, the coordinating node forwards the request to the data, +nodes which hold the data.  Each data node executes the request locally and, +returns its results to the coordinating node. In the _gather_  phase, the, +coordinating node reduces each data node's results into a single global, +resultset., +, +This means that a _client_ node needs to have enough memory and CPU in order to, +deal with the gather phase., +, +===============================================, +, +[float], +[[master-node]], +=== Master Eligible Node, +, +The master node is responsible for lightweight cluster-wide actions such as, +creating or deleting an index, tracking which nodes are part of the cluster,, +and deciding which shards to allocate to which nodes. It is important for, +cluster health to have a stable master node., +, +Any master-eligible node (all nodes by default) may be elected to become the, +master node by the <<modules-discovery-zen,master election process>>., +, +Indexing and searching your data is CPU-, memory-, and I/O-intensive work, +which can put pressure on a node's resources. To ensure that your master, +node is stable and not under pressure, it is a good idea in a bigger, +cluster to split the roles between dedicated master-eligible nodes and, +dedicated data nodes., +, +While master nodes can also behave as <<coordinating-node,coordinating nodes>>, +and route search and indexing requests from clients to data nodes, it is, +better _not_ to use dedicated master nodes for this purpose. It is important, +for the stability of the cluster that master-eligible nodes do as little work, +as possible., +, +To create a standalone master-eligible node, set:, +, +[source,yaml], +-------------------, +node.master: true <1>, +node.data: false <2>, +-------------------, +<1> The `node.master` role is enabled by default., +<2> Disable the `node.data` role (enabled by default)., +, +[float], +[[split-brain]], +==== Avoiding split brain with `minimum_master_nodes`, +]
