In the parent/child case parent document are returned based on matches in child, +documents or child document are returned based on matches in parent documents. In the nested case documents are returned, +based on matches in nested inner objects., +, +In both cases the actual matches in the different scopes that caused a document to be returned is hidden. In many cases, +it is very useful to know which inner nested objects in the case of nested or children or parent documents in the case, +of parent/child caused certain information to be returned. The inner hits feature can be used for this. This feature, +returns per search hit in the search response additional nested hits that caused a search hit to match in a different scope., +, +The following snippet explains the basic structure of inner hits:, +, +[source,js], +--------------------------------------------------, +"inner_hits" : {, +    "<inner_hits_name>" : {, +        "<path|type>" : {, +            "<path-to-nested-object-field|child-or-parent-type>" : {, +                <inner_hits_body>, +                [,"inner_hits" : { [<sub_inner_hits>]+ } ]?, +            }, +        }, +    }, +    [,"<inner_hits_name_2>" : { ... } ]*, +}, +--------------------------------------------------, +, +Inside the `inner_hits` definition, first the name if the inner hit is defined then whether the inner_hit, +is a nested by defining `path` or a parent/child based definition by defining `type`. The next object layer contains, +the name of the nested object field if the inner_hits is nested or the parent or child type if the inner_hit definition, +is parent/child based., +, +Multiple inner hit definitions can be defined in a single request. In the `<inner_hits_body>` any option for features, +that `inner_hits` support can be defined. Optionally another `inner_hits` definition can be defined in the `<inner_hits_body>`., +, +If `inner_hits` is defined each search will contain a `inner_hits` json object with the following structure:, +, +[source,js], +--------------------------------------------------, +"hits": [, +     {, +        "_index": ...,, +        "_type": ...,, +        "_id": ...,, +        "inner_hits": {, +           "<inner_hits_name>": {, +              "hits": {, +                 "total": ...,, +                 "hits": [, +                    {, +                       "_type": ...,, +                       "_id": ...,, +                       ..., +                    },, +                    ..., +                 ], +              }, +           }, +        },, +        ..., +     },, +     ..., +], +--------------------------------------------------, +, +==== Options, +, +Inner hits support the following options:, +, +[horizontal], +`path`:: Defines the nested scope where hits will be collected from., +`type`:: Defines the parent or child type score where hits will be collected from., +`query`:: Defines the query that will run in the defined nested, parent or child scope to collect and score hits. By default all document in the scope will be matched., +`from`:: The offset from where the first hit to fetch for each `inner_hits` in the returned regular search hits., +`size`:: The maximum number of hits to return per `inner_hits`. By default the top three matching hits are returned., +`sort`:: How the inner hits should be sorted per `inner_hits`. By default the hits are sorted by the score., +, +Either `path` or `type` must be defined. The `path` or `type` defines the scope from where hits are fetched and, +used as inner hits., +, +Inner hits also supports the following per document features:, +, +* <<search-request-highlighting,Highlighting>>, +* <<search-request-explain,Explain>>, +* <<search-request-source-filtering,Source filtering>>, +* <<search-request-script-fields,Script fields>>, +* <<search-request-fielddata-fields,Fielddata fields>>, +* <<search-request-version,Include versions>>, +, +[[nested-inner-hits]]]
