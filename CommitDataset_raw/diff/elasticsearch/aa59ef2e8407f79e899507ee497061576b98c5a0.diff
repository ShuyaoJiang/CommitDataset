[+++ b/docs/reference/common-options.asciidoc, +, +=== Human readable output, +, +Statistics are returned in a format suitable for humans, +(eg `"exists_time": "1h"` or `"size": "1kb"`) and for computers, +(eg `"exists_time_in_millis": 3600000`` or `"size_in_bytes": 1024`)., +The human readable values can be turned off by adding `?human=false`, +to the query string. This makes sense when the stats results are, +being consumed by a monitoring tool, rather than intended for human, +consumption.  The default for the `human` flag is, +`false`. added[1.00.Beta,Previously defaulted to `true`], +]
