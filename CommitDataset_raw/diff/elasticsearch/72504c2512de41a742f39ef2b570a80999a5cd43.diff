Otherwise the sort order for documents that have, +the same sort values would be undefined and could lead to missing or duplicate, +results. The <<mapping-id-field,`_id` field>> has a unique value per document, +but it is not recommended to use it as a tiebreaker directly., +<<doc-values,doc value>> are disabled on this field so sorting on it requires, +to load a lot of data in memory. Instead it is advised to duplicate (client side, + or with a <<ingest-processors,set ingest processor>>) the content, +of the <<mapping-id-field,`_id` field>> in another field that has, +<<doc-values,doc value>> enabled and to use this new field as the tiebreaker, +for the sort., +        {"tie_breaker_id": "asc"}, +// TEST[s/"tie_breaker_id": "asc"/"tie_breaker_id": {"unmapped_type": "keyword"}/]]
