If you use this feature, please let us know your experience with it!, +=====, +, +coming[1.1.0], +, +, +.Example use cases:, +* Suggesting "H5N1" when users search for "bird flu" in text, +* Identifying the merchant that is the "common point of compromise" from the transaction history of credit card owners reporting loss, +* Suggesting keywords relating to stock symbol $ATI for an automated news classifier, +* Spotting the fraudulent doctor who is diagnosing more than his fair share of whiplash injuries, +* Spotting the tire manufacturer who has a disproportionate number of blow-outs, +, +In all these cases the terms being selected are not simply the most popular terms in a set., +They are the terms that have undergone a significant change in popularity measured between a _foreground_ and _background_ set., +If the term "H5N1" only exists in 5 documents in a 10 million document index and yet is found in 4 of the 100 documents that make up a user's search results  , +that is significant and probably very relevant to their search. 5/10,000,000 vs 4/100 is a big swing in frequency., +, +==== Single-set analysis, +, +In the simplest case, the _foreground_ set of interest is the search results matched by a query and the _background_, +set used for statistical comparisons is the index or indices from which the results were gathered., +, +Example:, +, +[source,js], +--------------------------------------------------, +{, +    "query" : {, +        "terms" : {"force" : [ "British Transport Police" ]}, +    },, +    "aggregations" : {, +        "significantCrimeTypes" : {, +            "significant_terms" : { "field" : "crime_type" }, +        }, +    }, +}, +--------------------------------------------------, +, +Response:, +, +[source,js], +--------------------------------------------------, +{, +    ..., +, +    "aggregations" : {, +        "significantCrimeTypes" : {, +            "doc_count": 47347,, +            "buckets" : [, +                {, +                    "key": "Bicycle theft",, +                    "doc_count": 3640,, +                    "score": 0.371235374214817,, +                    "bg_count": 66799, +                }, +                ..., +            ], +        }, +    }, +}, +--------------------------------------------------, +, +When querying an index of all crimes from all police forces, what these results show is that the British Transport Police force , +stand out as a force dealing with a disproportionately large number of bicycle thefts. Ordinarily, bicycle thefts represent only 1% of crimes (66799/5064554) , +but for the British Transport Police, who handle crime on railways and stations, 7% of crimes (3640/47347) is, +a bike theft. This is a significant seven-fold increase in frequency and so this anomaly was highlighted as the top crime type., +, +The problem with using a query to spot anomalies is it only gives us one subset to use for comparisons., +To discover all the other police forces' anomalies we would have to repeat the query for each of the different forces., +, +This can be a tedious way to look for unusual patterns in an index  , +, +, +, +==== Multi-set analysis, +A simpler way to perform analysis across multiple categories is to use a parent-level aggregation to segment the data ready for analysis., +, +, +Example using a parent aggregation for segmentation:, +, +[source,js], +--------------------------------------------------, +{, +    "aggregations": {, +        "forces": {, +            "terms": {"field": "force"},, +            "aggregations": {, +                "significantCrimeTypes": {, +                    "significant_terms": {"field": "crime_type"}]
