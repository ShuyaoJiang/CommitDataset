[+++ b/docs/reference/migration/migrate_1_0.asciidoc, +, +== Percolator, +, +The percolator has been redesigned and because of this the dedicated `_percolator` index is no longer used by the percolator,, +but instead the percolator works with a dedicated `.percolator` type. Read the http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog/percolator-redesign-blog-post/[redesigned percolator], +blog post for the reasons why the percolator has been redesigned., +, +Elasticsearch will *not* delete the `_percolator` index when upgrading, only the percolate api will not use the queries, +stored in the `_percolator` index. In order to use the already stored queries, you can just re-index the queries from the, +`_percolator` index into any index under the reserved `.percolator` type. The format in which the percolate queries, +were stored has *not* been changed. So a simple script that does a scan search to retrieve all the percolator queries, +and then does a bulk request into another index should be sufficient.]
