[+++ b/docs/reference/mapping/fields/parent-field.asciidoc, +Global ordinals, by default, are built eagerly: if the index has changed,, +global ordinals for the `_parent` field will be rebuilt as part of the refresh., +This can add significant time the refresh. However most of the times this is the, +right trade-off, otherwise global ordinals are rebuilt when the first parent-child, +query or aggregation is used. This can introduce a significant latency spike for, +your users and usually this is worse as multiple global ordinals for the `_parent`, +field may be attempt rebuilt within a single refresh interval when many writes, +are occurring., +, +When the parent/child is used infrequently and writes occur frequently it may, +make sense to disable eager loading:, +        "eager_global_ordinals": false]
