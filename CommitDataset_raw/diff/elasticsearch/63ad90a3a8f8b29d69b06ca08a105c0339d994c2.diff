[+++ b/rest-api-spec/test/README.asciidoc, +Skipping tests:, +---------------, +If tests should be skipped on particular versions of Elasticsearch, the, +first entry in the list of tests should be called `skip`, and contain, +the range of versions to be skipped, and the reason why the tests are, +skipped.  For instance:, +, +    "Parent":, +     - skip:, +          version:     "0 - 0.90.2", +          reason:      Delete ignores the parent param, +, +     - do:, +       ... test definitions ..., +, +All tests in the file should be skipped if: `min <= current <= max`., +, +The `version` range should always have an upper bound. Versions should, +either have each version part compared numerically, or should be converted, +to a string with sufficient digits to allow string comparison, eg, +, +    0.90.2 -> 000-090-002, +, +Snapshot versions and versions of the form `1.0.0.Beta1` can be treated, +as the rounded down version, eg `1.0.0`.]
