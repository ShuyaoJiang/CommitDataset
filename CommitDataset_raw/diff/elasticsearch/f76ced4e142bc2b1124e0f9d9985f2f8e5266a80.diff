[+++ b/x-pack/docs/en/ilm/update-lifecycle-policy.asciidoc, +Updating existing ILM policies is useful to fix mistakes or change, +strategies for newly created indices. It is possible to update policy definitions, +and an index's `index.lifecycle.name` settings independently. To prevent the situation, +that phase definitions are modified while currently being executed on an index, each index, +will keep the version of the current phase definition it began execution with until it completes., +, +There are three scenarios for examining the behavior updating policies and, +their effects on policy execution on indices., +, +=== Updates to policies not managing indices, +, +Indices not referencing an existing policy that is updated will not be affected., +If an index is assigned to the policy, it will be assigned the latest version of that policy, +, +To show this, let's create a policy `my_policy`., +, +[source,js], +------------------------, +PUT _ilm/my_policy, +{, +  "policy": {, +    "phases": {, +      "hot": {, +        "actions": {, +          "rollover": {, +            "max_size": "25GB", +          }, +        }, +      },, +      "delete": {, +        "minimum_age": "30d",, +        "actions": {, +          "delete": {}, +        }, +      }, +    }, +  }, +}, +------------------------, +// CONSOLE, +, +This newly defined policy will be created and assigned to have a version equal, +to 1. Since we haven't assigned any indices to this policy, any updates that, +occur will be reflected completely on indices that are newly set to be managed, +by this policy., +, +Updating the Delete phase's minimum age can be done in an update request., +, +[source,js], +------------------------, +PUT _ilm/my_policy, +{, +  "policy": {, +    "phases": {, +      "hot": {, +        "actions": {, +          "rollover": {, +            "max_size": "25GB", +          }, +        }, +      },, +      "delete": {, +        "minimum_age": "10d", <1>, +        "actions": {, +          "delete": {}, +        }, +      }, +    }, +  }, +}, +------------------------, +// CONSOLE, +// TEST[continued], +<1> update `minimum_age` to 10 days, +, +//////////, +[source,js], +--------------------------------------------------, +GET _ilm, +--------------------------------------------------, +// CONSOLE, +// TEST[continued], +//////////, +, +When we get the policy, we will see it reflect our latest changes, but, +with its version bumped to 2., +, +[source,js], +--------------------------------------------------, +{, +  "my_policy": {, +    "version": 2, <1>, +    "modified_date": 82392349, <2>, +    "policy": {, +      "phases": {, +        "hot": {, +          "minimum_age": "0ms",, +          "actions": {, +            "rollover": {]
