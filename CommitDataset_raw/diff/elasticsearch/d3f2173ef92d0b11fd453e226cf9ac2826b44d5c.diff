For example, if the documents have a field, +that holds a price (numeric), we can configure this aggregation to dynamically build buckets with interval `5`, +(in case of price it may represent $5). When the aggregation executes, the price field of every document will be, +evaluated and will be rounded down to its closest bucket - for example, if the price is `32` and the bucket size is `5`, +then the rounding will yield `30` and thus the document will "fall" into the bucket that is associated withe the key `30`., +To make this more formal, here is the rounding function that is used:, +The response above shows that none of the aggregated products has a price that falls within the range of `[100 - 150)`., +By default, the response will only contain those buckets with a `doc_count` greater than 0. It is possible change that, +and request buckets with either a higher minimum count or even 0 (in which case elasticsearch will "fill in the gaps", +and create buckets with zero documents). This can be configured using the `min_doc_count` setting:, +                "min_doc_count" : 0, +                    "doc_count" : 0 <1>, +<1> No documents were found that belong in this bucket, yet it is still returned with zero `doc_count`., +, +By default the returned buckets are sorted by their `key` ascending, though the order behaviour can be controled, +using the `order` setting., +It is possible to only return buckets that have a document count that is greater than or equal to a configured, +limit through the `min_doc_count` option., +NOTE:   The special value `0` can be used to add empty buckets to the response between the minimum and the maximum buckets., +Here is an example of what the response could look like:, +By default, the buckets are returned as an ordered array. It is also possible to request the response as a hash, +instead keyed by the buckets keys:]
