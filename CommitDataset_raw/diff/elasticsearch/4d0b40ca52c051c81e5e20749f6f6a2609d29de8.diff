[+++ b/docs/reference/indices/seal.asciidoc, +The seal API flushes and adds a "seal" marker to the shards of one or more, +indices. The seal is used during recovery or restarts to skip the first and, +most costly phase of the process if all copies of the shard have the same seal., +No segment files need to be copied and the transaction log replay phase of the, +recovery can start immediately which makes recovery much faster., +There are two important points about seals:, +1. They are best effort in that if there are any outstanding write operations, +while the seal operation is being performed then the shards which those writes, +target won't be sealed but all others will be. See below for more., +2. The seal breaks as soon as the shard issues a new lucene commit. Uncommitted, +operations in the transaction log do not break the seal. That is because a seal, +marks a point in time snapshot of the segments, a low level lucene commit., +Practically that means that every write operation on the index will remove the, +seal., +[source,bash], +$ curl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/twitter/_seal', +The response contains details about which shards wrote the seal and the reason, +in case they failed to write the seal., +Here is what it looks like when all copies single shard index successfully, +wrote the seal:, +Here is what it looks like when one copy fails:, +Sometimes the failures can be shard wide and they'll look like this:]
