[+++ b/docs/reference/setup/upgrade.asciidoc, +[IMPORTANT], +====================================================, +During a rolling upgrade, primary shards assigned to a node with the higher, +version will never have their replicas assigned to a node with the lower, +version, because the newer version may have a different data format which is, +not understood by the older version., +, +If it is not possible to assign the replica shards to another node with the, +higher version -- e.g. if there is only one node with the higher version in, +the cluster -- then the replica shards will remain unassigned, i.e. the, +cluster health will be status `yellow`.  As soon as another node with the, +higher version joins the cluster, the replicas should be assigned and the, +cluster health will reach status `green`., +====================================================]
