[+++ b/docs/reference/query-dsl/percolate-query.asciidoc, +TIP: To provide a simple example, this documentation uses one index `my-index` for both the percolate queries and documents., +This set-up can work well when there are just a few percolate queries registered. However, with heavier usage it is recommended, +to store queries and documents in separate indices. Please see <<how-it-works, How it Works Under the Hood>> for more details., +, +[[how-it-works]], +, +Given the design of percolation, it often makes sense to use separate indices for the percolate queries and documents, +being percolated, as opposed to a single index as we do in examples. There are a few benefits to this approach:, +, +- Because percolate queries contain a different set of fields from the percolated documents, using two separate indices, +allows for fields to be stored in a denser, more efficient way., +- Percolate queries do not scale in the same way as other queries, so percolation performance may benefit from using, +a different index configuration, like the number of primary shards.]
