[+++ b/docs/reference/docs/termvectors.asciidoc, +==== Terms Filtering coming[2.0], +, +With the parameter `filter`, the terms returned could also be filtered based, +on their tf-idf scores. This could be useful in order find out a good, +characteristic vector of a document. This feature works in a similar manner to, +the <<mlt-query-term-selection,second phase>> of the, +<<query-dsl-mlt-query,More Like This Query>>. See <<docs-termvectors-terms-filtering,example 5>>, +for usage., +, +The following sub-parameters are supported:, +, +[horizontal], +`max_num_terms`::, +  Maximum number of terms that must be returned per field. Defaults to `25`., +`min_term_freq`::, +  Ignore words with less than this frequency in the source doc. Defaults to `1`., +`max_term_freq`::, +  Ignore words with more than this frequency in the source doc. Defaults to unbounded., +`min_doc_freq`::, +  Ignore terms which do not occur in at least this many docs. Defaults to `1`., +`max_doc_freq`::, +  Ignore words which occur in more than this many docs. Defaults to unbounded., +`min_word_length`::, +  The minimum word length below which words will be ignored. Defaults to `0`., +`max_word_length`::, +  The maximum word length above which words will be ignored. Defaults to unbounded (`0`)., +, +[float], +, +[float], +[[docs-termvectors-terms-filtering]], +=== Example 5, +, +Finally, the terms returned could be filtered based on their tf-idf scores. In, +the example below we obtain the three most "interesting" keywords from the, +artificial document having the given "plot" field value. Additionally, we are, +asking for distributed frequencies to obtain more accurate results. Notice, +that the keyword "Tony" or any stop words are not part of the response, as, +their tf-idf must be too low., +, +[source,js], +--------------------------------------------------, +GET /imdb/movies/_termvectors, +{, +    "doc": {, +      "plot": "When wealthy industrialist Tony Stark is forced to build an armored suit after a life-threatening incident, he ultimately decides to use its technology to fight against evil.", +    },, +    "term_statistics" : true,, +    "field_statistics" : true,, +    "dfs": true,, +    "positions": false,, +    "offsets": false,, +    "filter" : {, +      "max_num_terms" : 3,, +      "min_term_freq" : 1,, +      "min_doc_freq" : 1, +    }, +}, +--------------------------------------------------, +, +Response:, +, +[source,js], +--------------------------------------------------, +{, +   "_index": "imdb",, +   "_type": "movies",, +   "_version": 0,, +   "found": true,, +   "term_vectors": {, +      "plot": {, +         "field_statistics": {, +            "sum_doc_freq": 3384269,, +            "doc_count": 176214,, +            "sum_ttf": 3753460, +         },, +         "terms": {, +            "armored": {, +               "doc_freq": 27,, +               "ttf": 27,, +               "term_freq": 1,, +               "score": 9.74725, +            },, +            "industrialist": {, +               "doc_freq": 88,, +               "ttf": 88,, +               "term_freq": 1,, +               "score": 8.590818, +            },, +            "stark": {, +               "doc_freq": 44,, +               "ttf": 47,, +               "term_freq": 1,, +               "score": 9.272792, +            }, +         }, +      }, +   }, +}]
