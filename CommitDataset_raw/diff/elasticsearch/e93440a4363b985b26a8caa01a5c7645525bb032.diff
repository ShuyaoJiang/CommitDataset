[+++ b/docs/reference/upgrade/rolling_upgrade.asciidoc, +Similarly, if you run a testing/development environment with only one master, +node, the master node should be upgraded last. Restarting a single master node, +forces the cluster to be reformed. The new cluster will initially only have the, +upgraded master node and will thus reject the older nodes when they re-join the, +cluster. Nodes that have already been upgraded will successfully re-join the , +upgraded master. ]
