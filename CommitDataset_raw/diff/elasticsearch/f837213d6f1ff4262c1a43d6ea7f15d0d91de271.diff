[+++ b/config/elasticsearch.yml, +##################### ElasticSearch Configuration Example #####################, +, +# This file contains an overview of various configuration settings,, +# targeted at operations staff. Application developers should, +# consult the guide at <http://elasticsearch.org/guide>., +#, +# The installation procedure is covered at, +# <http://elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/setup/installation.html>., +#, +# ElasticSearch comes with reasonable defaults for most settings,, +# so you can try it out without bothering with configuration., +#, +# Most of the time, these defaults are just fine for running a production, +# cluster. If you're fine-tuning your cluster, or wondering about the, +# effect of certain configuration option, please _do ask_ on the, +# mailing list or IRC channel [http://elasticsearch.org/community]., +, +# See <http://elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/setup/configuration.html>, +# for information on supported formats and syntax for the configuration file., +, +, +################################### Cluster ###################################, +, +# Cluster name identifies your cluster for auto-discovery. If you're running, +# multiple clusters on the same network, make sure you're using unique names., +#, +, +#################################### Node #####################################, +, +# Node names are generated dynamically on startup, so you're relieved, +# from configuring them manually. You can tie this node to a specific name:, +#, +# node.name: "Franz Kafka", +, +# Every node can be configured to allow or deny being eligible as the master,, +# and to allow or deny to store the data., +#, +# Allow this node to be eligible as a master node (enabled by default):, +#, +# node.master: true, +#, +# Allow this node to store data (enabled by default):, +#, +# node.data: true, +, +# You can exploit these settings to design advanced cluster topologies., +#, +# 1. You want this node to never become a master node, only to hold data., +#    This will be the "workhorse" of your cluster., +#, +# node.master: false, +# node.data: true, +#, +# 2. You want this node to only serve as a master: to not store any data and, +#    to have free resources. This will be the "coordinator" of your cluster., +#, +# node.master: true, +# node.data: false, +#, +# 3. You want this node to be neither master nor data node, but, +#    to act as a "search load balancer" (fetching data from nodes,, +#    aggregating results, etc.), +#, +# node.master: false, +# node.data: false, +, +# Use the Cluster Health API [http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health], the, +# Node Info API [http://localhost:9200/_cluster/nodes] or GUI tools, +# such as <http://github.com/lukas-vlcek/bigdesk> and, +# <http://mobz.github.com/elasticsearch-head> to inspect the cluster state., +, +, +#################################### Index ####################################, +, +# You can set a number of options (such as shard/replica options, mapping, +# or analyzer definitions, translog settings, ...) for indices globally,, +# in this file., +#, +# Note, that it makes more sense to configure index settings specifically for, +# a certain index, either when creating it or by using the index templates API., +#, +# See <http://elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/index-modules/> and, +# <http://elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/admin-indices-create-index.html>, +# for more information., +, +# Set the number of shards (splits) of an index (5 by default):, +#, +# index.number_of_shards: 5, +, +# Set the number of replicas (additional copies) of an index (1 by default):, +#, +# index.number_of_replicas: 1, +, +# Note, that for development on a local machine, with small indices, it usually, +# makes sense to "disable" the distributed features:, +#, +# index.number_of_shards: 1, +# index.number_of_replicas: 0, +]
