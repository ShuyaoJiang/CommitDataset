+=== Moving Average Aggregation, +, +Given an ordered series of data, the Moving Average aggregation will slide a window across the data and emit the average, +value of that window.  For example, given the data `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, we can calculate a simple moving, +average with windows size of `5` as follows:, +, +- (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) / 5  = 3, +- (2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) / 5  = 4, +- (3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) / 5 = 5, +- etc, +, +Moving averages are a simple method to smooth sequential data.  Moving averages are typically applied to time-based data,, +such as stock prices or server metrics.  The smoothing can be used to eliminate high frequency fluctuations or random noise,, +which allows the lower frequency trends to be more easily visualized, such as seasonality., +, +==== Syntax, +, +A `moving_avg` aggregation looks like this in isolation:, +, +[source,js], +--------------------------------------------------]
