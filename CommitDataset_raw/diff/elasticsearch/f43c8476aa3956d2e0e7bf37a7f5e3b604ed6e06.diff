This is sufficient for you, +to run a local development server (or even a development cluster, if you start, +multiple nodes on the same machine), but you will need to configure some, +<<common-network-settings,basic network settings>> in order to run a real, +production cluster across multiple servers., +[WARNING], +.Be careful with the network configuration!, +=============================, +Never expose an unprotected node to the public internet., +=============================, +[[common-network-settings]], +=== Commonly Used Network Settings, +, +`network.host`::, +, +The node will bind to this hostname or IP address and _publish_ (advertise), +this host to other nodes in the cluster. Accepts an IP address, hostname, or a, +<<network-interface-values,special value>>., ++, +Defaults to `_local_`., +, +`discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts`::, +, +In order to join a cluster, a node needs to know the hostname or IP address of, +at least some of the other nodes in the cluster.  This settting provides the, +initial list of other nodes that this node will try to contact. Accepts IP, +addresses or hostnames., ++, +Defaults to `["127.0.0.1", "[::1]"]`., +, +`http.port`::, +, +Port to bind to for incoming HTTP requests. Accepts a single value or a range., +If a range is specified, the node will bind to the first available port in the, +range., ++, +Defaults to `9200-9300`., +, +`transport.tcp.port`::, +, +Port to bind for communication between nodes. Accepts a single value or a, +range. If a range is specified, the node will bind to the first available port, +in the range., ++, +Defaults to `9300-9400`., +, +[float], +[[network-interface-values]], +The following special values may be passed to `network.host`:, +[horizontal], +`_[networkInterface]_`::, +  Addresses of a network interface, for example `_en0_`., +`_local_`::, +  Any loopback addresses on the system, for example `127.0.0.1`., +`_site_`::, +  Any site-local addresses on the system, for example `192.168.0.1`., +, +`_global_`::, +, +  Any globally-scoped addresses on the system, for example `8.8.8.8`., +, +==== IPv4 vs IPv6, +, +These special values will work over both IPv4 and IPv6 by default, but you can, +also limit this with the use of `:ipv4` of `:ipv6` specifiers. For example,, +`_en0:ipv4_` would only bind to the IPv4 addresses of interface `en0`., +, +[TIP], +.Discovery in the cloud, +================================, +, +More special settings are available when running in the cloud with either the, +{plugins}/discovery-ec2-discovery.html#discovery-ec2-network-host[EC2 discovery plugin] or the, +{plugins}/discovery-gce-network-host.html#discovery-gce-network-host[Google Compute Engine discovery plugin], +installed., +, +================================, +, +[float], +[[advanced-network-settings]], +The `network.host` setting explained in <<common-network-settings,Commonly used network settings>>, +is a shortcut which sets the _bind host_ and the _publish host_ at the same, +time. In advanced used cases, such as when running behind a proxy server, you, +may need to set these settings to different values:, +`network.bind_host`::, +This specifies which network interface(s) a node should bind to in order to, +listen for incoming requests.  A node can bind to multiple interfaces, e.g., +two network cards, or a site-local address and a local address. Defaults to, +`network.host`., +`network.publish_host`::, +, +The publish host is the single interface that the node advertises to other, +nodes in the cluster, so that those nodes can connect to it.   Currently an, +elasticsearch node may be bound to multiple addresses, but only publishes one.]
