The available values are: `us-east` (`us-east-1`), `us-west` (`us-west-1`), `us-west-1`, `us-west-2` `ap-southeast` (`ap-southeast-1`), `ap-northeast` (`ap-northeast-1`) `eu-west` (`eu-west-1`)., +, +, +## EC2 Discovery, +, +ec2 discovery allows to use the ec2 APIs to perform automatic discovery (similar to multicast in non hostile multicast environments). Here is a simple sample configuration:, +, +    cloud:, +        aws:, +            access_key: AKVAIQBF2RECL7FJWGJQ, +            secret_key: vExyMThREXeRMm/b/LRzEB8jWwvzQeXgjqMX+6br, +    , +    discovery:, +        type: ec2, +, +The following are a list of settings (prefixed with `discovery.ec2`) that can further control the discovery:, +, +* `groups`: Either a comma separated list or array based list of (security) groups. Only instances with the provided security groups will be used in the cluster discovery., +* `host_type`: The type of host type to use to communicate with other instances. Can be one of `private_ip`, `public_ip`, `private_dns`, `public_dns`. Defaults to `private_ip`., +* `availability_zones`: Either a comma separated list or array based list of availability zones. Only instances within the provided availability zones will be used in the cluster discovery., +* `any_group`: If set to `false`, will require all security groups to be present for the instance to be used for the discovery. Defaults to `true`., +* `ping_timeout`: How long to wait for existing EC2 nodes to reply during discovery. Defaults to 3s., +, +### Filtering by Tags, +, +The ec2 discovery can also filter machines to include in the cluster based on tags (and not just groups). The settings to use include the `discovery.ec2.tag.` prefix. For example, setting `discovery.ec2.tag.stage` to `dev` will only filter instances with a tag key set to `stage`, and a value of `dev`. Several tags set will require all of those tags to be set for the instance to be included., +, +One practical use for tag filtering is when an ec2 cluster contains many nodes that are not running elasticsearch. In this case (particularly with high `ping_timeout` values) there is a risk that a new node's discovery phase will end before it has found the cluster (which will result in it declaring itself master of a new cluster with the same name - highly undesirable). Tagging elasticsearch ec2 nodes and then filtering by that tag will resolve this issue.]
