For example, when updating the mappings for only a subset of the, +indices in the cluster state, only the updates for those indices need to be, +published to the nodes in the cluster, as long as those nodes have the previous, +cluster state. If a node is missing the previous cluster state, for example, +when rejoining a cluster, the master will publish the full cluster state to, +that node so that it can receive future updates as diffs., +]
