To test just the docs from a single page,, +use e.g. `gradle :docs:check -Dtests.method=*rollover*`., +By default each `// CONSOLE` snippet runs as its own isolated test. You can, +manipulate the test execution in the following ways:, +are tests even if they don't have `// CONSOLE` but usually `// TEST` is used, +for its modifiers:, +  * `// TEST[s/foo/bar/]`: Replace `foo` with `bar` in the generated test. This, +  should be used sparingly because it makes the snippet "lie". Sometimes,, +  though, you can use it to make the snippet more clear more clear. Keep in, +  mind the that if there are multiple substitutions then they are applied in, +  the order that they are defined., +  tests the nodes are cleaned: indexes are removed, etc. This prevents that, +  from happening between snippets because the two snippets are a single test., +  This is most useful when you have text and snippets that work together to, +  in the same test, allowing you to interleave requests with responses to check., +  * `// TESTRESPONSE[s/foo/bar/]`: Substitutions. See `// TEST[s/foo/bar]` for, +  how it works. These are much more common than `// TEST[s/foo/bar]` because, +  they are useful for eliding portions of the response that are not pertinent, +  to the documentation.]
