[+++ b/docs/plugins/discovery-file.asciidoc, +[[discovery-file]], +=== File-Based Discovery Plugin, +, +The file-based discovery plugin uses a list of hosts/ports in a `unicast_hosts.txt` file , +in the `config/discovery-file` directory for unicast discovery., +, +[[discovery-file-install]], +[float], +==== Installation, +, +This plugin can be installed using the plugin manager:, +, +[source,sh], +----------------------------------------------------------------, +sudo bin/elasticsearch-plugin install discovery-file, +----------------------------------------------------------------, +, +The plugin must be installed on every node in the cluster, and each node must, +be restarted after installation. Note that installing the plugin will add a, +`discovery-file` directory to the `config` folder, and a default `unicast_hosts.txt`, +file that must be edited with the correct unicast hosts list before starting the node., +, +[[discovery-file-remove]], +[float], +==== Removal, +, +The plugin can be removed with the following command:, +, +[source,sh], +----------------------------------------------------------------, +sudo bin/elasticsearch-plugin remove discovery-file, +----------------------------------------------------------------, +, +The node must be stopped before removing the plugin., +, +[[discovery-file-usage]], +[float], +==== Using the file-based discovery plugin, +, +The file-based discovery plugin provides the ability to specify the , +unicast hosts list through a simple `unicast_hosts.txt` file that can, +be dynamically updated at any time.  The discovery type for this plugin, +is still the default `zen` plugin, so no changes are required to the , +`elasticsearch.yml` config file.  This plugin simply provides a facility, +to supply the unicast hosts list for zen discovery through an external, +file that can be updated at any time by a side process.  , +, +For example, this gives a convenient mechanism for an Elasticsearch instance , +that is  run in docker containers to be dynamically supplied a list of IP , +addresses to connect to for zen discovery when those IP addresses may not be , +known at node startup.  , +, +Note that the file-based discovery plugin is meant to augment the unicast, +hosts list in `elasticsearch.yml` (if specified), not replace it.  Therefore,, +if there are valid unicast host entries in `discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts`,, +they will be used in addition to those supplied in `unicast_hosts.txt`., +, +Anytime a change is made to the `unicast_hosts.txt` file, even as Elasticsearch, +continues to run, the new changes will be picked up by the plugin and the, +new hosts list will be used for the next pinging round for master election., +, +Upon installation of the plugin, a default `unicast_hosts.txt` file will, +be found in the `$CONFIG_DIR/discovery-file` directory.  This default file, +will contain some comments about what the file should contain.  All comments, +for this file must appear on their lines starting with `#` (i.e. comments, +cannot start in the middle of a line)., +, +[[discovery-file-format]], +[float], +==== unicast_hosts.txt file format, +, +The format of the file is to specify one unicast host entry per line.  , +Each unicast host entry consists of the host (host name or IP address) and, +an optional transport port number.  If the port number is specified, is must , +come immediately after the host (on the same line) separated by a `:`. , +If the port number is not specified, a default value of 9300 is used.  , +, +For example, this is an example of `unicast_hosts.txt` for a cluster with, +four nodes that participate in unicast discovery, some of which are not, +running on the default port:, +, +[source,txt], +----------------------------------------------------------------, +10.10.10.5, +10.10.10.6:9305, +10.10.10.5:10005, +# an IPv6 address, +[2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334]:9301, +----------------------------------------------------------------, +, +Host names are allowed instead of IP addresses (similar to , +`discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts`), and IPv6 addresses must be , +specified in brackets with the port coming after the brackets. , +++ b/docs/plugins/discovery-file.asciidoc, +[[discovery-file]], +=== File-Based Discovery Plugin, +, +The file-based discovery plugin uses a list of hosts/ports in a `unicast_hosts.txt` file , +in the `config/discovery-file` directory for unicast discovery.]
