This means any changes made to them after the installation will not be picked up unless, +the service is reinstalled., +, +Based on the architecture of the available JDK/JRE (set through `JAVA_HOME`), the appropriate 64-bit(x64) or 32-bit(x86), +service will be installed. This information is made available during install:, +, +[source,sh], +--------------------------------------------------, +c:\elasticsearch-0.90.5\bin>service install, +Installing service      :  "elasticsearch-service-x64", +Using JAVA_HOME (64-bit):  "c:\jvm\jdk1.7", +The service 'elasticsearch-service-x64' has been installed., +--------------------------------------------------, +, +NOTE: While a JRE can be used for the Elasticsearch service, due to its use of a client VM (as oppose to a server JVM which, +offers better performance for long-running applications) its usage is discouraged and a warning will be issued., +, +=== Customizing service settings, +, +There are two ways to customize the service settings:, +, +Manager GUI:: accessible through `manager` command, the GUI offers insight into the installed service including its status, startup type,, +JVM, start and stop settings among other things. Simply invoking `service.bat` from the command-line with the aforementioned option, +will open up the manager window:, +, +image::images/service-manager-win.png["Windows Service Manager GUI",align="center"], +, +Customizing `service.bat`:: at its core, `service.bat` relies on http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-daemon/[Apache Commons Daemon] project, +to install the services. For full flexibility such as customizing the user under which the service runs, one can modify the installation, +parameters to tweak all the parameters accordingly. Do note that this requires reinstalling the service for the new settings to be applied.]
