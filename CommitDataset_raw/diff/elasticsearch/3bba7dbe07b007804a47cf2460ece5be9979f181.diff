[+++ b/docs/reference/modules/snapshots.asciidoc, +The snapshot and restore module allows to create snapshots of individual, +indices or an entire cluster into a remote repository like shared file system,, +S3, or HDFS. These snapshots are great for backups because they can be restored, +relatively quickly but they are not archival because they can only be restored, +to versions of Elasticsearch that can read the index. That means that:, +, +* A snapshot of an index created in 2.x can be restored to 5.x., +* A snapshot of an index created in 1.x can be restored to 2.x., +* A snapshot of an index created in 1.x can **not** be restored to 5.x., +, +To restore a snapshot of an index created in 1.x to 5.x you can restore it to, +a 2.x cluster and use <<reindex-from-remote,reindex-from-remote>> to rebuild, +the index in a 5.x cluster. This is as time consuming as restoring from, +archival copies of the original data.]
