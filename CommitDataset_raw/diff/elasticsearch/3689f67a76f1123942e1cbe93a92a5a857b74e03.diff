[+++ b/docs/reference/search/aggregations/bucket/geodistance-aggregation.asciidoc, +There are three distance calculation modes: `sloppy_arc` (the default), `arc` (most accurate) and `plane` (fastest). The `arc` calculation is the most accurate one but also the more expensive one in terms of performance. The `sloppy_arc` is faster but less accurate. The `plane` is the fastest but least accurate distance function. Consider using `plane` when your search context is "narrow" and spans smaller geographical areas (like cities or even countries). `plane` may return higher error mergins for searches across very large areas (e.g. cross continent search). The distance calculation type can be set using the `distance_type` parameter:]
