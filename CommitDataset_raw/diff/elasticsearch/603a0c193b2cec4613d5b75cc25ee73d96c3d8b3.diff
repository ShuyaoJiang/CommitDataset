[+++ b/docs/reference/index-modules/translog.asciidoc, +Changes to Lucene are only persisted to disk during a Lucene commit,, +index or delete operation. Changes that happen after one commit and before another, +will be lost in the event of process exit or HW failure., +log associated with it. Any index or delete operation is written to the, +translog after being processed by the internal Lucene index., +An Elasticsearch flush is the process of performing a Lucene commit and, +starting a new translog. It is done automatically in the background in order, +to make sure the transaction log doesn't grow too large, which would make, +replaying its operations take a considerable amount of time during recovery., +It is also exposed through an API, though its rarely needed to be performed, +manually., +, +, +How often the translog is ++fsync++ed to disk. Defaults to `5s`. Can be set to, +`0` to sync after each operation., +whenever a `sync` is triggered by the `sync_interval`., +to be completed on the replicas before returning success to the client., +We are constantly monitoring the perfromance implications of better default, +translog sync semantics, so the default might change as time passes and HW,, +virtualization, and other aspects improve., +]
