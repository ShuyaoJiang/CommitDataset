[+++ b/docs/reference/setup/as-a-service.asciidoc, +`RESTART_ON_UPGRADE`::    Configure restart on package upgrade, defaults to `false`. This means you will have to restart your elasticsearch instance after installing a package manually. The reason for this is to ensure, that upgrades in a cluster do not result in a continuous shard reallocation resulting in high network traffic and reducing the response times of your cluster.]
