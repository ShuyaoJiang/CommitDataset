[+++ b/README.textile, +Maan, that twitter index might get big (in this case, index size == valuation). Let's see if we can structure our twitter system a bit differently in order to support such large amounts of data., +Elasticsearch supports multiple indices, as well as multiple types per index. In the previous example we used an index called @twitter@, with two types, @user@ and @tweet@., +Another way to define our simple twitter system is to have a different index per user (note, though that each index has an overhead).

You can easily search on multiple twitter users (indices), with different boost levels per user (index), making social search so much simpler (results from my friends rank higher than results from friends of my friends)., +In order to play with the distributed nature of Elasticsearch, simply bring more nodes up and shut down nodes.
