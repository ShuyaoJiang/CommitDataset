The available values are:, +, +* `us-east` (`us-east-1`), +* `us-west` (`us-west-1`), +* `us-west-1`, +* `us-west-2`, +* `ap-southeast` (`ap-southeast-1`), +* `ap-southeast-1`, +* `ap-southeast-2`, +* `ap-northeast` (`ap-northeast-1`), +* `eu-west` (`eu-west-1`), +* `sa-east` (`sa-east-1`)., +, +, +## EC2 Discovery, +, +ec2 discovery allows to use the ec2 APIs to perform automatic discovery (similar to multicast in non hostile multicast environments). Here is a simple sample configuration:, +, +```, +    type: ec2, +The ec2 discovery is using the same credentials as the rest of the AWS services provided by this plugin (`repositories`)., +See [Generic Configuration](#generic-configuration) for details., +The following are a list of settings (prefixed with `discovery.ec2`) that can further control the discovery:, +* `groups`: Either a comma separated list or array based list of (security) groups. Only instances with the provided security groups will be used in the cluster discovery. (NOTE: You could provide either group NAME or group ID.), +* `host_type`: The type of host type to use to communicate with other instances. Can be one of `private_ip`, `public_ip`, `private_dns`, `public_dns`. Defaults to `private_ip`., +* `availability_zones`: Either a comma separated list or array based list of availability zones. Only instances within the provided availability zones will be used in the cluster discovery., +* `any_group`: If set to `false`, will require all security groups to be present for the instance to be used for the discovery. Defaults to `true`., +* `ping_timeout`: How long to wait for existing EC2 nodes to reply during discovery. Defaults to `3s`. If no unit like `ms`, `s` or `m` is specified, milliseconds are used., +### Filtering by Tags, +The ec2 discovery can also filter machines to include in the cluster based on tags (and not just groups). The settings to use include the `discovery.ec2.tag.` prefix. For example, setting `discovery.ec2.tag.stage` to `dev` will only filter instances with a tag key set to `stage`, and a value of `dev`. Several tags set will require all of those tags to be set for the instance to be included., +One practical use for tag filtering is when an ec2 cluster contains many nodes that are not running elasticsearch. In this case (particularly with high `ping_timeout` values) there is a risk that a new node's discovery phase will end before it has found the cluster (which will result in it declaring itself master of a new cluster with the same name - highly undesirable). Tagging elasticsearch ec2 nodes and then filtering by that tag will resolve this issue., +### Automatic Node Attributes, +Though not dependent on actually using `ec2` as discovery (but still requires the cloud aws plugin installed), the plugin can automatically add node attributes relating to ec2 (for example, availability zone, that can be used with the awareness allocation feature). In order to enable it, set `cloud.node.auto_attributes` to `true` in the settings., +## S3 Repository, +, +The S3 repository is using S3 to store snapshots. The S3 repository can be created using the following command:, +$ curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/_snapshot/my_s3_repository' -d '{, +    "type": "s3",, +        "bucket": "my_bucket_name",, +        "region": "us-west", +The following settings are supported:, +* `bucket`: The name of the bucket to be used for snapshots. (Mandatory), +* `region`: The region where bucket is located. Defaults to US Standard, +* `base_path`: Specifies the path within bucket to repository data. Defaults to root directory., +* `access_key`: The access key to use for authentication. Defaults to value of `cloud.aws.access_key`., +* `secret_key`: The secret key to use for authentication. Defaults to value of `cloud.aws.secret_key`., +* `chunk_size`: Big files can be broken down into chunks during snapshotting if needed. The chunk size can be specified in bytes or by using size value notation, i.e. `1g`, `10m`, `5k`. Defaults to `100m`., +* `compress`: When set to `true` metadata files are stored in compressed format. This setting doesn't affect index files that are already compressed by default. Defaults to `false`., +* `server_side_encryption`: When set to `true` files are encrypted on server side using AES256 algorithm. Defaults to `false`., +, +The S3 repositories are using the same credentials as the rest of the AWS services provided by this plugin (`discovery`)., +See [Generic Configuration](#generic-configuration) for details., +, +Multiple S3 repositories can be created. If the buckets require different credentials, then define them as part of the repository settings., +, +## Recommended S3 Permissions, +]
