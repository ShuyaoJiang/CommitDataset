[+++ b/docs/reference/getting-started.asciidoc, +, +The number of shards and replicas can be defined per index at the time the index is created. After the index is created, you may also change the number of replicas dynamically anytime. You can change the number of shards for an existing index using the {ref}/indices-shrink-index.html[`_shrink`] and {ref}/indices-split-index.html[`_split`] APIs, however this is not a trivial task and pre-planning for the correct number of shards is the optimal approach.]
