[+++ b/docs/reference/aggregations/pipeline.asciidoc, +Data in the real world is often noisy and sometimes contains *gaps* -- places where data simply doesn't exist.  This can, +occur for a variety of reasons, the most common being:, +* Documents falling into a bucket do not contain a required field, +* There are no documents matching the query for one or more buckets, +* The metric being calculated is unable to generate a value, likely because another dependent bucket is missing a value., +Some pipeline aggregations have specific requirements that must be met (e.g. a derivative cannot calculate a metric for the, +first value because there is no previous value, HoltWinters moving average need "warmup" data to begin calculating, etc), +Gap policies are a mechanism to inform the pipeline aggregation about the desired behavior when "gappy" or missing, +data is encountered.  All pipeline aggregations accept the `gap_policy` parameter.  There are currently two gap policies, +to choose from:, +                This option treats missing data as if the bucket does not exist.  It will skip the bucket and continue, +                calculating using the next available value., +                This option will replace missing values with a zero (`0`) and pipeline aggregation computation will, +                proceed as normal.]
