Note: This parameter is only relevant for `term` and, +`recursive` strategies., +| `quadtree`, +|`precision` |deprecated[6.6, PrefixTrees no longer used] This parameter may, +be used instead of `tree_levels` to set an appropriate value for the, +`tree_levels` parameter. The value specifies the desired precision and, +Elasticsearch will calculate the best tree_levels value to honor this, +precision. The value should be a number followed by an optional distance, +unit. Valid distance units include: `in`, `inch`, `yd`, `yard`, `mi`,, +`miles`, `km`, `kilometers`, `m`,`meters`, `cm`,`centimeters`, `mm`,, +`millimeters`. Note: This parameter is only relevant for `term` and, +`recursive` strategies., +|`tree_levels` |deprecated[6.6, PrefixTrees no longer used] Maximum number, +of layers to be used by the PrefixTree. This can be used to control the, +precision of shape representations andtherefore how many terms are, +indexed. Defaults to the default value of the chosen PrefixTree, +implementation. Since this parameter requires a certain level of, +understanding of the underlying implementation, users may use the, +`precision` parameter instead. However, Elasticsearch only uses the, +tree_levels parameter internally and this is what is returned via the, +mapping API even if you use the precision parameter. Note: This parameter, +is only relevant for `term` and `recursive` strategies., +|`strategy` |deprecated[6.6, PrefixTrees no longer used] The strategy, +parameter defines the approach for how to represent shapes at indexing, +and search time. It also influences the capabilities available so it, +is recommended to let Elasticsearch set this parameter automatically., +There are two strategies available: `recursive`, and `term`., +Recursive and Term strategies are deprecated and will be removed in a, +future version. While they are still available, the Term strategy, +supports point types only (the `points_only` parameter will be, +automatically set to true) while Recursive strategy supports all, +shape types. (IMPORTANT: see <<prefix-trees, Prefix trees>> for more, +detailed information about these strategies), +|`distance_error_pct` |deprecated[6.6, PrefixTrees no longer used] Used as a, +hint to the PrefixTree about how precise it should be. Defaults to 0.025 (2.5%), +with 0.5 as the maximum supported value. PERFORMANCE NOTE: This value will, +default to 0 if a `precision` or `tree_level` definition is explicitly defined., +This guarantees spatial precision at the level defined in the mapping. This can, +lead to significant memory usage for high resolution shapes with low error, +(e.g., large shapes at 1m with < 0.001 error). To improve indexing performance, +(at the cost of query accuracy) explicitly define `tree_level` or `precision`, +along with a reasonable `distance_error_pct`, noting that large shapes will have, +greater false positives. Note: This parameter is only relevant for `term` and, +`recursive` strategies., +|`points_only` |deprecated[6.6, PrefixTrees no longer used] Setting this option to, +`true` (defaults to `false`) configures the `geo_shape` field type for point, +shapes only (NOTE: Multi-Points are not yet supported). This optimizes index and, +search performance for the `geohash` and `quadtree` when it is known that only points, +will be indexed. At present geo_shape queries can not be executed on `geo_point`, +field types. This option bridges the gap by improving point performance on a, +`geo_shape` field so that `geo_shape` queries are optimal on a point only field., +, +[[geoshape-indexing-approach]], +[float], +==== Indexing approach, +GeoShape types are indexed by decomposing the shape into a triangular mesh and, +indexing each triangle as a 7 dimension point in a BKD tree. This provides, +near perfect spatial resolution (down to 1e-7 decimal degree precision) since all, +spatial relations are computed using an encoded vector representation of the, +original shape instead of a raster-grid representation as used by the, +<<prefix-trees>> indexing approach. Performance of the tessellator primarily, +depends on the number of vertices that define the polygon/multi-polyogn. While, +this is the default indexing technique prefix trees can still be used by setting, +the `tree` or `strategy` parameters according to the appropriate, +<<geo-shape-mapping-options>>. Note that these parameters are now deprecated, +and will be removed in a future version., +, +deprecated[6.6, PrefixTrees no longer used] To efficiently represent shapes in, +an inverted index, Shapes are converted into a series of hashes representing, +grid squares (commonly referred to as "rasters") using implementations of a, +PrefixTree. The tree notion comes from the fact that the PrefixTree uses multiple, +grid layers, each with an increasing level of precision to represent the Earth., +This can be thought of as increasing the level of detail of a map or image at higher, +zoom levels. Since this approach causes precision issues with indexed shape, it has, +been deprecated in favor of a vector indexing approach that indexes the shapes as a, +triangular mesh (see <<geoshape-indexing-approach>>)., +deprecated[6.6, PrefixTrees no longer used]  The indexing implementation, +selected relies on a  SpatialStrategy for choosing how to decompose the shapes, +(either as grid  squares or a tessellated triangular mesh). Each strategy, +answers the following:, +`Recursive` and `Term` strategies do not provide 100% accuracy and depending on, +how they are configured it may return some false positives for `INTERSECTS`,, +`WITHIN` and `CONTAINS` queries, and some false negatives for `DISJOINT` queries.]
