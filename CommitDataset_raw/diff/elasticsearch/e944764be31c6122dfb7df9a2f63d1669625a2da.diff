[+++ b/docs/reference/ilm/policy-definitions.asciidoc, +=== Phase Execution, +, +beta[], +, +The current phase definition, of an index's policy being executed, is stored, +in the index's metadata. The phase and its actions are compiled into a series, +of discrete steps that are executed sequentially. Since some {ILM} actions are, +more complex and involve multiple operations against an index, each of these, +operations are done in isolation in a unit called a "step". The, +<<ilm-explain-lifecycle,Explain Lifecycle API>> exposes this information to us, +to see which step our index is either to execute next, or is currently, +executing., +]
