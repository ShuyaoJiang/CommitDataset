[+++ b/docs/reference/migration/migrate_2_2.asciidoc, +[float], +=== Default logging using systemd, +, +In previous versions of Elasticsearch using systemd, the default logging, +configuration routed standard output to `/dev/null` and standard error to, +the journal. However, there are often critical error messages at, +startup that are logged to standard output rather than standard error, +and these error messages would be lost to the ether. The default has, +changed to now route standard output to the journal and standard error, +to inherit this setting (these are the defaults for systemd). These, +settings can be modified by editing the `elasticsearch.service` file., +, +[float], +=== Cloud AWS Plugin, +, +Proxy settings have been deprecated and renamed:, +, +* from `cloud.aws.proxy_host` to `cloud.aws.proxy.host`, +* from `cloud.aws.ec2.proxy_host` to `cloud.aws.ec2.proxy.host`, +* from `cloud.aws.s3.proxy_host` to `cloud.aws.s3.proxy.host`, +* from `cloud.aws.proxy_port` to `cloud.aws.proxy.port`, +* from `cloud.aws.ec2.proxy_port` to `cloud.aws.ec2.proxy.port`, +* from `cloud.aws.s3.proxy_port` to `cloud.aws.s3.proxy.port`, +, +If you are using proxy settings, update your settings as deprecated ones will, +be removed in next major version., +]
