+, +++ b/build-spring-framework/resources/readme.txt, +SPRING FRAMEWORK 3.0 M4 (August 2009), +-------------------------------------, +This is the fourth milestone of Spring 3.0 which is scheduled for final release in Q3 2009., +It is nearly feature complete, with only very specific areas still being worked on for RC1., +This release comes with complete reference documentation already. Consult the provided, +javadoc for technical details of specific packages and classes., +this release does not contain a 'spring.jar' file anymore, in contrast to previous Spring, +generations. Furthermore, the jar file names follow bundle repository conventions now., +A Getting Started guide is to be provided in time for Spring 3.0 GA. For the time being,, +please consult the blog examples at http://blog.springsource.com as well as the sections, +of interest in the reference documentation.]
