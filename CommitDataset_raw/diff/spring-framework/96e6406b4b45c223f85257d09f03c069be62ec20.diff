This is, + * analogous to the behavior in Spring XML: if the {@code profile} attribute of the, + * {@code beans} element will not be parsed unless at least profile 'p1' or 'p2' has been, + * with {@code @Profile({"p1", "p2"})}, that class will not be registered or processed unless, + * at least profile 'p1' or 'p2' has been activated., + * component will be registered if the profile is <em>not</em> active &mdash; for example,, + * given {@code @Profile({"p1", "!p2"})}, registration will occur if profile 'p1' is active or, + * if profile 'p2' is <em>not</em> active., + * <p>If the {@code @Profile} annotation is omitted, registration will occur regardless, + * {@code <beans>} element may be used.
