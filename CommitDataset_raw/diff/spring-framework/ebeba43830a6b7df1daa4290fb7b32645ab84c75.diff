[+++ b/src/asciidoc/testing.adoc, +Since Spring Framework 4.3, the size of the context cache is bounded with a default, +maximum size of 32. Whenever the maximum size is reached, a _least recently used_ (LRU), +eviction policy is used to evict and close stale contexts. The maximum size can be, +configured from the command line or a build script by setting a JVM system property named, +`spring.test.context.cache.maxSize`. As an alternative, the same property can be set, +programmatically via the `SpringProperties` API., +]
