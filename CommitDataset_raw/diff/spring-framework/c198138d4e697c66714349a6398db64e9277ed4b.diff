[+++ b/src/docs/asciidoc/web/web-uris.adoc, +. Each URI component (path, query, etc) is encoded individually., +The rules for encoding are as follows: within a URI component, apply percent encoding to, +all illegal characters, including non-US-ASCII characters, and all other characters that, +are illegal within the URI component, as defined in RFC 3986., +The above default encoding strategy *does not* encode all characters with reserved, +meaning, but only the ones that are illegal within a given URI component. If this is not, +what you expect, you can use the alternative strategy described next., +When using <<web-uribuilder,DefaultUriBuilderFactory>> -- plugged into the `WebClient`,, +`RestTemplate`, or used directly, you can switch to an alternative encoding strategy as, +shown below:, +This alternative encoding strategy applies `UriUtils.encode(String, Charset)` to each URI, +variable value prior to expanding it, effectively encoding all non-US-ASCII characters,, +and *all* characters with reserved meaning in a URI, which ensures that the expanded URI, +variables do not have any impact on the structure or meaning of the URI.]
