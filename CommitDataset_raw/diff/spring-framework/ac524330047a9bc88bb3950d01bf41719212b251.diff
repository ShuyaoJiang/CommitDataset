[+++ b/spring-framework-reference/src/cache.xml, +		<para>One can also indicate whether the eviction should occur after (the default) or before the method executes (the default) through the <literal>afterInvocation</literal> attribute., +		The former provides the same semantics as the rest of the annotations - once the method completes successfully, an action (in this case eviction) on the cache is executed. If the method does not, +		execute (as it might be cached) or an exception is thrown, the eviction does not occur. The latter (<literal>afterInvocation=false</literal>) causes the eviction to occur always, before the method, +		is invoked - this is useful in cases where the eviction does not need to be tied to the method outcome.</para>, +		]
