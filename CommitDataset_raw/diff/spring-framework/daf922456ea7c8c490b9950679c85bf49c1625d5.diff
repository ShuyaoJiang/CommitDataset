[+++ b/org.springframework.expression/readme.txt, +- Need to agree on a standard date format for 'default' processing of dates.  Currently it is:, +  formatter = new SimpleDateFormat("EEE, d MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss z", Locale.UK);, +  // this is something of this format: "Wed, 4 Jul 2001 12:08:56 GMT", +  // http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html, +- See LiteralTests for Date (4,5,6) - should date take an expression rather than be hardcoded in the grammar, +  to take 2 strings only?, +- when doing arithmetic, eg. 8.4 / 4  and the user asks for an Integer return type - do we silently coerce or, +  say we cannot as it won't fit into an int? (see EvaluationTests.testMathOperatorDivide04), +- Is $index within projection/selection useful or just cute?, +  ]
