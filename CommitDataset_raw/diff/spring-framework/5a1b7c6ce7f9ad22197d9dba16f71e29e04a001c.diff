[+++ b/import-into-idea.md, +The following has been tested against Intellij IDEA 13.1, +1. Pre-compile `spring-oxm` with `./gradlew cleanIdea :spring-oxm:compileTestJava`, +2. Import into IDEA (File->import project->import from external model->Gradle), +3. Set the Project JDK as appropriate (1.8+), +4. Exclude the `spring-aspects` module (Go to File->Project Structure->Modules), +1. `spring-oxm` should be pre-compiled since it's using repackaged dependencies (see *RepackJar tasks), +should be excluded from the overall project to avoid compilation errors.]
