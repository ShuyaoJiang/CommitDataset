[+++ b/src/asciidoc/web-mvc.adoc, +[NOTE], +====, +Sometimes it's convenient to have a `LocalValidatorFactoryBean` injected into a controller, +or another class. The easiest way to do that is to declare your own `@Bean` and also mark it, +with `@Primary` in order to avoid a conflict with the one provided with the MVC Java config., +, +If you prefer to use the one from the MVC Java config, you'll need to override the, +`mvcValidator` method from `WebMvcConfigurationSupport` and declare the method to explicitly, +return `LocalValidatorFactory` rather than `Validator`. See <<mvc-config-advanced-java>>, +for information on how to switch to extend the provided configuration., +====, +]
