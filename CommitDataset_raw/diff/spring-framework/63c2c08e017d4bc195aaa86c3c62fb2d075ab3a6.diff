[+++ b/src/docs/asciidoc/web/webmvc.adoc, +The file extension is then used to interpret the requested content type to use for, +the response (i.e. instead of the "Accept" header), e.g. `/person.pdf`,, +`/person.xml`, etc., +Using file extensions like this was necessary when browsers used to send Accept headers, +that were hard to interpret consistently. At present that is no longer a necessity and, +using the "Accept" header should be the preferred choice., +Over time the use of file name extensions has proven problematic in a variety of ways., +It can cause ambiguity when overlayed with the use of URI variables, path parameters,, +URI encoding, and it also makes it difficult to reason about URL-based authorization, +and security (see next section for more details)., +To completely disable the use of file extensions, you must set both of these:, +, +* `useSuffixPatternMatching(false)`, see <<mvc-config-path-matching,PathMatchConfigurer>>, +* `favorPathExtension(false)`, see <<mvc-config-content-negotiation,ContentNeogiationConfigurer>>, +, +URL-based content negotiation can still be useful, for example when typing a URL in a, +browser. To enable that we recommend a query parameter based strategy to avoid most of, +the issues that come with file extensions. Or if you must use file extensions, consider, +restricting them to a list of explicitly registered extensions through the, +`mediaTypes` property of <<mvc-config-content-negotiation,ContentNeogiationConfigurer>>.]
