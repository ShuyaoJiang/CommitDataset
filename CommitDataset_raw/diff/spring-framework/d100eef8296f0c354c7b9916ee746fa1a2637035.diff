[+++ b/src/asciidoc/index.adoc, +[IMPORTANT], +====, +The caching abstraction has no special handling of multi-threaded and multi-process, +environments as such features are handled by the cache implementation. ., +====, +, +If you have a multi-process environment (i.e. an application deployed on several nodes),, +you will need to configure your cache provider accordingly. Depending on your use cases,, +a copy of the same data on several nodes may be enough but if you change the data during, +the course of the application, you may need to enable other propagation mechanisms., +, +Caching a particular item is a direct equivalent of the typical get-if-not-found-then-, +proceed-and-put-eventually code blocks found with programmatic cache interaction: no locks, +are applied and several threads may try to load the same item concurrently. The same applies, +to eviction: if several threads are trying to update or evict data concurrently, you may, +use stale data. Certain cache providers offer advanced features in that area, refer to, +the documentation of the cache provider that you are using for more details., +]
