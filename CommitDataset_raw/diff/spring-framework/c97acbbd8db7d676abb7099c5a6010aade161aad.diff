Methods with `@SubscribeMapping` support the same, +<<websocket-stomp-message-mapping,method arguments>> as `@MessageMapping` methods do., +The main difference is that for the return value, in the absence of `@SendTo` and, +"clientOutboundChannel" channel. Effectively in this case the subscription is used as, +a one-time, request-reply message exchange with the subscription never stored., +This is useful for loading data on startup and for initializing a front-end UI.]
