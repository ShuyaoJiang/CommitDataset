[+++ b/spring-beans/src/main/java/org/springframework/beans/BeanInfoFactory.java, + * <p>BeanInfoFactories are are instantiated by the {@link CachedIntrospectionResults},, + * which looks for {@code META-INF/spring.beanInfoFactories} files on the class path., + * These files contain one or more {@code BeanInfoFactory} class names, each of a single, + * line. When a {@link BeanInfo} is to be created, the {@code CachedIntrospectionResults}, + * will iterate through the discovered factories, asking each one if it {@linkplain, + * #supports(Class) supports} the given bean class. If it does, {@link, + * #getBeanInfo(Class)} will be called; if not, the next factory will be queried. If none, + * of the factories support the class, an standard {@link BeanInfo} is created as a, + * default., + *, + * <p>Note that the {@link CachedIntrospectionResults} sorts the {@code BeanInfoFactory}, + * instances by {@link org.springframework.core.annotation.Order Order}, so that ones with, + * a higher precedence come first., + *]
