Note that this behavior is semantically, +equivalent to how you configure your application in production: in production, +configuration you will define either a set of XML or Groovy resource locations or a set, +of `@Configuration` classes that your production `ApplicationContext` will be loaded, +from, but you still have the freedom to include or import the other type of configuration., +It is also possible to omit the declaration of XML configuration files, Groovy scripts,, +or annotated classes in `@ContextConfiguration` entirely and instead declare only]
