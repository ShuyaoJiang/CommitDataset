[+++ b/src/asciidoc/testing.adoc, +Many times when writing tests, it's useful to _dump_ the results of the performed request., +As long as request processing does not cause an unhandled exception, the `print()` method, +will print all the available result data to `System.out`. Spring Framework 4.2 introduces, +a new `log()` method and two additional variants of the `print()` method: one that accepts, +an `OutputStream` and one that accepts a `Writer`. For example, invoking, +`print(System.err)` will print the result data to `System.err`; while invoking, +`print(myWriter)` will print the result data to a custom writer. If you would like to, +have the result data _logged_ instead of printed, simply invoke the `log()` method which, +will log the result data as a single `DEBUG` message under the, +`org.springframework.test.web.servlet.result` logging category.]
