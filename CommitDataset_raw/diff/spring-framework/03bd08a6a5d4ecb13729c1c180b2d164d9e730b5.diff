[+++ b/src/asciidoc/index.adoc, +The `<exclude-unlisted-classes/>` shortcut indicates that __no__ scanning for, +annotated entity classes is supposed to occur. An explicit 'true' value specified -, +`<exclude-unlisted-classes>true</exclude-unlisted-classes/>` - also means no scan., +`<exclude-unlisted-classes>false</exclude-unlisted-classes/>` does trigger a scan;, +however, it is recommended to simply omit the `exclude-unlisted-classes` element, +if you want entity class scanning to occur.]
