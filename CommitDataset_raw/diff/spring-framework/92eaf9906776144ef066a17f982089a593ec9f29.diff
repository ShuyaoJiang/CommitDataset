[+++ b/spring-web/src/main/java/org/springframework/web/server/adapter/WebHttpHandlerBuilder.java, + * This builder has two purposes:, + * <p>One is to assemble a processing chain that consists of a target {@link WebHandler},, + * then decorated with a set of {@link WebFilter WebFilters}, then further decorated with, + * a set of {@link WebExceptionHandler WebExceptionHandlers}., + * <p>The second purpose is to adapt the resulting processing chain to an {@link HttpHandler}:, + * the lowest-level reactive HTTP handling abstraction which can then be used with any of the, + * supported runtimes. The adaptation is done with the help of {@link HttpWebHandlerAdapter}., + * <p>The processing chain can be assembled manually via builder methods, or detected from, + * a Spring {@link ApplicationContext} via {@link #applicationContext}, or a mix of both., +	 * Whether a {@code WebSessionManager} is configured or not, either detected from an, +	 * {@code ApplicationContext} or explicitly configured via {@link #sessionManager}., +		return (this.sessionManager != null);, +	 * Whether a {@code ServerCodecConfigurer} is configured or not, either detected from an, +	 * {@code ApplicationContext} or explicitly configured via {@link #codecConfigurer}., +		return (this.codecConfigurer != null);, +	 * Whether a {@code LocaleContextResolver} is configured or not, either detected from an, +	 * {@code ApplicationContext} or explicitly configured via {@link #localeContextResolver}., +		return (this.localeContextResolver != null);]
