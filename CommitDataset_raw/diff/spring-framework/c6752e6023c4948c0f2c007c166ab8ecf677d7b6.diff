[+++ b/src/asciidoc/core-beans.adoc, +the declared type being irrelevant for the matching process. `@Autowired` has rather, +different semantics: After selecting candidate beans by type, the specified String, +qualifier value will be considered within those type-selected candidates only, e.g., +matching an "account" qualifier against beans marked with the same qualifier label., +In this case, qualifier values can be used to select among same-typed collections,, +as outlined in the previous paragraph., +, +As of 4.3, `@Autowired` also considers self references for injection, i.e. references, +back to the bean that is currently injected. Note that self injection is a fallback;, +regular dependencies on other components always have precedence. In that sense, self, +references do not participate in regular candidate selection and are therefore in, +particular never primary; on the contrary, they always end up as lowest precedence., +In practice, use self references as a last resort only, e.g. for calling other methods, +on the same instance through the bean's transactional proxy: Consider factoring out, +the affected methods to a separate delegate bean in such a scenario. Alternatively,, +use `@Resource` which may obtain a proxy back to the current bean by its unique name.]
