[+++ b/src/asciidoc/web-mvc.adoc, +[[mvc-ann-rest-exceptions]], +=== REST Controller Exception Handling, +, +An `@RestController` may use `@ExceptionHandler` methods that return a, +`ResponseEntity` to provide both a response status and error details in the body, +of the response. Such methods may also be added to `@ControllerAdvice`, +classes for exception handling across a subset or all controllers., +, +A common requirement is to include error details in the body of the response., +Spring does not automatically do this (although Spring Boot does) because the, +representation of error details in the response body is application specific., +, +Applications that wish to implement a global exception handling strategy with, +error details in the response body should consider extending the abstract base, +class `ResponseEntityExceptionHandler` which provides handling for the exceptions, +that Spring MVC raises and provides hooks to customize the response body as, +well as to handle other exceptions. Simply declare the extension class as a, +Spring bean and annotate it with `@ControllerAdvice`. For more details see, +See `ResponseEntityExceptionHandler`., +, +, +, +]
