[+++ b/src/asciidoc/testing.adoc, +When you test application code that manipulates the state of a Hibernate session or JPA, +persistence context, make sure to __flush__ the underlying unit of work within test, +methods that execute that code. Failing to flush the underlying unit of work can produce, +__false positives__: your test may pass, but the same code throws an exception in a live,, +production environment. In the following Hibernate-based example test case, one method, +demonstrates a false positive, and the other method correctly exposes the results of, +flushing the session. Note that this applies to any ORM frameworks that maintain an, +in-memory __unit of work__., +	SessionFactory sessionFactory;, +	@Transactional, +	@Transactional, +	@PersistenceContext, +	EntityManager entityManager;, +	@Transactional, +		updateEntityInJpaPersistenceContext();, +	@Transactional, +		updateEntityInJpaPersistenceContext();]
