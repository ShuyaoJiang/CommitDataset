The following example shows how to do so:, +For example, the configuration metadata for subsystem A may refer to a DataSource by the, +name of `subsystemA-dataSource`. The configuration metadata for subsystem B may refer to, +name of `myApp-dataSource`. To have all three names refer to the same object, you can, +add the following alias definitions to the configuration metadata:, +	<alias name="myApp-dataSource" alias="subsystemA-dataSource"/>, +	<alias name="myApp-dataSource" alias="subsystemB-dataSource"/>, +		@Bean({"dataSource", "subsystemA-dataSource", "subsystemB-dataSource"})]
