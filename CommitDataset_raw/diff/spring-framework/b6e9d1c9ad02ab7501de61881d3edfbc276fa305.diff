In several places an `Inventor` and Inventor's `Society` classes are used as the, +`org.springframework.expression` and its sub packages such as `spel.support`., +`prop1.prop2.prop3` and the setting of property values, +properties, methods, or fields and to help perform type conversion. There are two, +configuration options. You may use it to specify a default root object and to configure, +It _excludes_ Java type references, constructors, and bean references.
