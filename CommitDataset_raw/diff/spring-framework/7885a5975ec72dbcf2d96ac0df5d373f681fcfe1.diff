For example, the method `getFoo` in class, +`FooController` is assigned the name "FC#getFoo". This naming strategy is pluggable, +by implementing `HandlerMethodMappingNamingStrategy` and configuring it on your, +`RequestMappingHandlerMapping`. Furthermore the `@RequestMapping` annotation includes, +a name attribute that can be used to override the default strategy., +, +[NOTE], +====, +The assigned request mapping names are logged at TRACE level on startup., +====, +, +The Spring JSP tag library provides a function called `mvcUrl` that can be used to, +prepare links to controller methods based on this mechanism., +, +For example given:, +, +[source,java,indent=0], +[subs="verbatim,quotes"], +----, +    @RequestMapping("/people/{id}/addresses"), +    public class MyController {, +, +        @RequestMapping("/{country}"), +        public HttpEntity getAddress(@PathVariable String country) { ... }, +    }, +----, +, +The following JSP code can prepare a link:, +, +[source,jsp,indent=0], +[subs="verbatim,quotes"], +----, +<%@ taglib uri="http://www.springframework.org/tags" prefix="s" %>, +..., +<a href="${s:mvcUrl('PC#getPerson').arg(0,'123').build()}">Get Person</a>, +----, +, +, +, +]
