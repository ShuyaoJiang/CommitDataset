[+++ b/src/asciidoc/core-aop.adoc, +* As of Spring 4.0, the constructor of your proxied object will NOT be called twice, +  anymore since the CGLIB proxy instance will be created via Objenesis. Only if your, +  JVM does not allow for constructor bypassing, you might see double invocations and, +  corresponding debug log entries from Spring's AOP support.]
