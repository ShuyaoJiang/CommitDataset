[+++ b/src/asciidoc/index.adoc, +==== Using the JobDetailFactoryBean, +Quartz `JobDetail` objects contain all information needed to run a job. Spring provides a, +`JobDetailFactoryBean` which provides bean-style properties for XML configuration purposes., +Let's have a look at an example:, +	<bean name="exampleJob" class="org.springframework.scheduling.quartz.JobDetailFactoryBean">, +The job detail configuration has all information it needs to run the job (`ExampleJob`)., +The timeout is specified in the job data map. The job data map is available through the, +`JobExecutionContext` (passed to you at execution time), but the `JobDetail` also gets, +its properties from the job data mapped to properties of the job instance. So in this, +case, if the `ExampleJob` contains a bean property named `timeout`, the `JobDetail`, +will have it applied automatically:, +		 * with the value from the JobDetailFactoryBean (5), +All additional properties from the job data map are of course available to you as well., +of the job, respectively. By default, the name of the job matches the bean name, +of the `JobDetailFactoryBean` (in the example above, this is `exampleJob`).]
