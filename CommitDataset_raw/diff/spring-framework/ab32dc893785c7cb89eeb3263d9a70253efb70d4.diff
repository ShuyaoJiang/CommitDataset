[+++ b/src/docs/asciidoc/languages/kotlin.adoc, +=== Checked Exceptions, +, +Java and https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/exceptions.html[Kotlin exception handling] are pretty close, with the main, +difference being that Kotlin treats all exceptions as unchecked exceptions. However, when using proxied objects, +(for example classes or methods annotated with `@Transactional`), checked exceptions thrown will be wrapped by default in, +an `UndeclaredThrowableException`., +, +To get the original exception thrown like in Java, methods should be annotated with https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.jvm/-throws/index.html[`@Throws`], +to specify explicitly the checked exceptions thrown (for example `@Throws(IOException::class)`)., +]
