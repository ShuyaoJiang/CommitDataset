The, +          sample class would then have to look as follows:</para>, +, +          <programlisting language="java">package examples;, +, +public class ExampleBean {, +, +  <lineannotation>// </lineannotation>Fields omitted, +, +  @ConstructorProperties({"years", "ultimateAnswer"}), +  public ExampleBean(int years, String ultimateAnswer) {, +      this.years = years;, +      this.ultimateAnswer = ultimateAnswer;, +  }, +}</programlisting>]
