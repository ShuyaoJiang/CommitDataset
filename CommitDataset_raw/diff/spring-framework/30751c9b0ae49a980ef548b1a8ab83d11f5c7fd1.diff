[+++ b/spring-framework-reference/src/beans-extension-points.xml, +      <para>As with <interfacename>BeanPostProcessors</interfacename>, you typically, +        do not want <interfacename>BeanFactoryPostProcessors</interfacename> marked as, +        lazy-initialized. If no other bean references a <interfacename>Bean(Factory)PostProcessor, +        </interfacename> those wouldn't get instantiated at all. Thus, marking them as, +        lazy-initialized will be ignored and the <interfacename>Bean(Factory)PostProcessor, +        </interfacename> will be instantied eagerly even if you use the <literal>default-lazy-init, +        </literal> attribute set to <literal>true</literal>on the declaration of your, +        <code><beans /></code> element.</para>]
