[+++ b/src/asciidoc/index.adoc, +If you are just getting started with Spring, you may want to begin using Spring Framework, +by creating a http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[Spring Boot] based application., +Spring Boot provides a quick (and opinionated) way to create production-ready Spring based, +application. It is based on Spring Framework, favors convention over configuration and is, +designed to get you up and running as quickly as possible., +You can use http://start.spring.io[start.spring.io] to generate a basic project, or follow, +one of the https://spring.io/guides["Getting Started" guides] like the, +one. As well as being easier to digest, these guides are very __task focused__ and most of, +them are based on Spring Boot. They also cover other projects from the Spring portfolio, +that you might want to consider when solving a particular problem., +Java applications -- a loose term that runs the gamut from constrained embedded to n-tier, +[[background-ioc]], +.Background, +****, +"__The question is, what aspect of control are [they] inverting?__" Martin Fowler posed, +this question about Inversion of Control (IoC), +http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html[on his site] in 2004. Fowler suggested, +renaming the principle to make it more self-explanatory and came up with __Dependency, +Injection__., +****, +, +`spring-beans`, `spring-context`, `spring-context-support`, and `spring-expression`, +(Spring Expression Language) modules., +`spring-context-support` provides support for integrating common third-party libraries, +into a Spring application context for caching (EhCache, Guava, JCache), mailing, +(JavaMail), scheduling (CommonJ, Quartz) and template engines (FreeMarker, JasperReports,, +Velocity)., +, +implementations to be used in certain application servers. The `spring-instrument-tomcat`, +module contains the Spring's instrumentation agent for Tomcat., +Servlet listeners and a web-oriented application context. It also contains an HTTP client, +and the web-related parts of Spring's remoting support., +model-view-controller (<<mvc-introduction,__MVC__>>) and REST Webservices implementation, +for web applications. Spring's MVC framework provides a clean separation between domain, +model code and web forms and integrates with all of the other features of the Spring, +Framework., +from embedded applications that run on resource-constrained devices to full-fledged, +enterprise applications that use Spring's transaction management functionality and web, +framework integration., +it manually by downloading all the jars yourself., +, +, +As from Spring Framework 4.0, it is now possible to define external bean configuration, +using a Groovy DSL. This is similar in concept to using XML bean definitions, but allows, +for a more concise syntax. Using Groovy also allows you to easily embed bean definitions, +generally recommended over the `BeanFactory`, except for a few situations such as in, +embedded applications running on resource-constrained devices where memory consumption, +might be critical and a few extra kilobytes might make a difference. However, for, +most typical enterprise applications and systems, the `ApplicationContext` is what you, +will want to use. Spring makes __heavy__ use of the <<beans-factory-extension-bpp,, +`BeanPostProcessor` extension point>> (to effect proxying and so on). If you use only a, +plain `BeanFactory`, a fair amount of support such as transactions and AOP will not take, +effect, at least not without some extra steps on your part. This situation could be, +confusing because nothing is actually wrong with the configuration.]
