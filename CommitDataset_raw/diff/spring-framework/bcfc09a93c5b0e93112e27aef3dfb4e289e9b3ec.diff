[+++ b/src/asciidoc/integration.adoc, +[[cache-annotations-cacheable-synchronized]], +===== Synchronized caching, +In a multi-threaded environment, certain operations might be concurrently invoked for, +the same argument (typically on startup). By default, the cache abstraction does not, +lock anything and the same value may be computed several times, defeating the purpose, +of caching., +, +For those particular cases, the `sync` attribute can be used to instruct the underlying, +cache provider to _lock_ the cache entry while the value is being computed. As a result,, +only one thread will be busy computing the value while the others are blocked until the, +entry is updated in the cache., +, +[source,java,indent=0], +[subs="verbatim,quotes"], +----, +	@Cacheable(cacheNames="foos", **sync="true"**), +	public Foo executeExpensiveOperation(String id) {...}, +----, +, +[NOTE], +====, +This is an optional feature and your favorite cache library may not support it. All, +`CacheManager` implementations provided by the core framework support it. Check the, +documentation of your cache provider for more details., +====, +, +]
