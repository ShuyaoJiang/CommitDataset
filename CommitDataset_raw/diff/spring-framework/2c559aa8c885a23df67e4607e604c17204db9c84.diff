[+++ b/spring-framework-reference/src/mvc.xml, +, +      <para>A common pitfall when working with annotated controller classes is, +      a scenario where you want apply functionality to it that involves, +      creating a proxy for the controller object (transactional controllers, +      e.g.). Usually you will introduce an interface for the controller then, +      to use JDK dynamic proxies. To make this work you have to move the, +      <interfacename>@RequestMapping</interfacename> annotations to the, +      interface as well as the mapping lookup only "sees" the interface, +      exposed by the proxy then. An alternative might be to activate, +      <code>proxy-target-class="true"</code> in the configuration for the, +      functionality applied to the controller (in our transaction scenario in, +      <code>&lt;tx:annotation-driven /&gt;</code>). For more information on, +      various proxying mechanisms see <xref linkend="aop-proxying" />.</para>]
