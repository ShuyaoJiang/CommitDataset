[+++ b/src/asciidoc/index.adoc, +The `destroy-method` attribute of a `<bean>` element can be assigned a special, +`(inferred)` value which instructs Spring to automatically detect a public `close` or, +`shutdown` method on the specific bean class. This special `(inferred)` value can also be, +set on the `default-destroy-method` attribute of a `<beans>` element to apply this, +behavior to an entire set of beans (see, +By default, beans defined using Java config that have a public `close` or `shutdown`, +method are automatically enlisted with a destruction callback. If you have a public, +`close` or `shutdown` method and you do not wish for it to be called when the container, +shuts down, simply add `@Bean(destroyMethod="")` to your bean definition to disable the, +default `(inferred)` mode.]
