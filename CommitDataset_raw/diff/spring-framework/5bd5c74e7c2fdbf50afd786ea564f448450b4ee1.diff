[+++ b/src/asciidoc/testing.adoc, +The core of the framework consists of the `TestContextManager` class and the, +`TestContext`, `TestExecutionListener`, and `SmartContextLoader` interfaces. A, +`TestContextManager` is created per test class (e.g., for the execution of all test, +methods within a single test class in JUnit). The `TestContextManager` in turn manages a, +`TestContext` that holds the context of the current test. The `TestContextManager` also, +updates the state of the `TestContext` as the test progresses and delegates to, +++TestExecutionListener++s, which instrument the actual test execution by providing, +dependency injection, managing transactions, and so on. A `SmartContextLoader` is, +responsible for loading an `ApplicationContext` for a given test class. Consult the, +javadocs and the Spring test suite for further information and examples of various, +implementations., +  for the test instance for which it is responsible. The `TestContext` also delegates to a, +  `SmartContextLoader` to load an `ApplicationContext` if requested., +** prior to any __before class__ or __before all__ methods of a particular testing framework, +** test instance post-processing, +** prior to any __before__ or __before each__ methods of a particular testing framework, +** after any __after__ or __after each__ methods of a particular testing framework, +** after any __after class__ or __after all__ methods of a particular testing framework]
