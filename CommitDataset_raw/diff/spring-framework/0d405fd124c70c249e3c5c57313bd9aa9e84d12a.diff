[+++ b/spring-framework-reference/src/beans.xml, +      <title>Are annotations better than XML for configuring Spring?</title>, +      <para>The introduction of annotation-based configurations raised the, +      question of whether this approach is 'better' than XML. The short, +      answer is <emphasis>it depends</emphasis>. The long answer is that each, +      approach has its pros and cons, and usually it is up to the developer to, +      annotations provide a lot of context in their declaration, leading to, +      shorter and more concise configuration. However, XML excels at wiring up, +      components without touching their source code or recompiling them. Some, +      developers prefer having the wiring close to the source while others, +      argue that annotated classes are no longer POJOs and, furthermore, that, +      the configuration becomes decentralized and harder to control.</para>]
