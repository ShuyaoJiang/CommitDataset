[+++ b/spring-framework-reference/src/mvc.xml, +        <caption><para>The request processing workflow in Spring Web MVC, +  Owner owner = ownerService.findOwner(ownerId);  , +      <interfacename>Set</interfacename> or a <interfacename>List</interfacename>, +      is to peek into the collection, take the short class name of the first object, +      in the collection, and use that with <literal>List</literal> appended to the, +      name. The same applies to arrays although with arrays it is not necessary to , +      peek into the array contents. A few examples will make the semantics of name, +      generation for collections clearer:</para>, +          <para>An <classname>x.y.User[]</classname> array with zero or more, +          <para>An <classname>x.y.Foo[]</classname> array with zero or more]
