[+++ b/src/asciidoc/core-validation.adoc, +Sometimes you only want a `Converter` to execute if a specific condition holds true. For, +example, you might only want to execute a `Converter` if a specific annotation is present, +on the target field. Or you might only want to execute a `Converter` if a specific method,, +such as a `static valueOf` method, is defined on the target class., +`ConditionalGenericConverter` is the union of the `GenericConverter` and, +`ConditionalConverter` interfaces that allows you to define such custom matching criteria:, +	public interface ConditionalGenericConverter, +	        extends GenericConverter, ConditionalConverter {, +A good example of a `ConditionalGenericConverter` is an EntityConverter that converts, +`findAccount(Long)`. You would perform such a finder method check in the implementation of, +`matches(TypeDescriptor, TypeDescriptor)`.]
