[+++ b/src/asciidoc/core-beans.adoc, +[NOTE], +====, +Bean metadata and manually supplied singleton instances need to be registered as early, +as possible, in order for the container to properly reason about them during autowiring, +and other introspection steps. While overriding of existing metadata and existing, +singleton instances is supported to some degree, the registration of new beans at, +runtime (concurrently with live access to factory) is not officially supported and may, +lead to concurrent access exceptions and/or inconsistent state in the bean container., +====, +, +ultimately just another bean in the container: This means that they can take advantage of, +`@Autowired` and `@Value` injection etc just like any other bean!, +classes are processed quite early during the initialization of the context and forcing a dependency, +to be injected this way may lead to unexpected early initialization. Whenever possible, resort to, +parameter-based injection as in the example above., +, +Also, be particularly careful with `BeanPostProcessor` and `BeanFactoryPostProcessor` definitions, +via `@Bean`. Those should usually be declared as `static @Bean` methods, not triggering the, +instantiation of their containing configuration class. Otherwise, `@Autowired` and `@Value` won't, +work on the configuration class itself since it is being created as a bean instance too early.]
