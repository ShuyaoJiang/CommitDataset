[+++ b/src/asciidoc/index.adoc, +The Spring container validates the configuration of each bean as the container is created., +However, the bean properties themselves are not set until the bean __is actually created__., +Beans that are singleton-scoped and set to be pre-instantiated (the default) are created, +when the container is created. Scopes are defined in <<beans-factory-scopes>>. Otherwise,, +the bean is created only when it is requested. Creation of a bean potentially causes a, +graph of beans to be created, as the bean's dependencies and its dependencies', +dependencies (and so on) are created and assigned. Note that resolution mismatches among, +those dependencies may show up late, i.e. on first creation of the affected bean.]
