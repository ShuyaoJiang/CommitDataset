[+++ b/CONTRIBUTING.md, +_Have something you'd like to contribute to the framework?  We welcome pull, +requests, but ask that you carefully read this document first to understand how, +best to submit them; what kind of changes are likely to be accepted; and what, +to expect from the Spring team when evaluating your submission._, +, +_Please refer back to this document as a checklist before issuing any pull, +request; this will save time for everyone!_, +, +## Understand the basics, +, +Not sure what a pull request is, or how to submit one?  Take a look at GitHub's, +excellent [help documentation][] first., +, +, +## Search JIRA first; create an issue if necessary, +, +Is there already an issue that addresses your concern?  Do a bit of searching, +in our [JIRA issue tracker][] to see if you can find something similar. If not,, +please create a new issue before submitting a pull request unless the change is, +truly trivial, e.g. typo fixes, removing compiler warnings, etc., +, +## Discuss non-trivial contribution ideas with committers, +, +If you're considering anything more than correcting a typo or fixing a minor, +bug, please discuss it on the [spring-framework-contrib][] mailing list before, +submitting a pull request. We're happy to provide guidance but please spend an, +hour or two researching the subject on your own including searching the mailing, +list for prior discussions., +, +## Sign the Contributor License Agreement, +, +If you have not previously done so, please fill out and submit the, +[SpringSource CLA form][]. You'll receive a token when this process is complete., +Keep track of this, you may be asked for it later!, +, +Note that emailing/postal mailing a signed copy is _not_ necessary. Submission, +of the web form is all that is required., +, +When you've completed the web form, simply add the following in a comment on, +your pull request:, +, +    I have signed and agree to the terms of the SpringSource Individual, +    Contributor License Agreement., +, +You do not need to include your token/id. Please add the statement above to all, +future pull requests as well, simply so the Spring Framework team knows, +immediately that this process is complete., +, +, +## Create your branch from `master`, +, +At any given time, Spring Framework's `master` branch represents the version, +currently under development. For example, if 3.1.1 was the latest Spring, +Framework release, `master` represents 3.2.0 development, and the `3.1.x`, +branch represents 3.1.2 development., +, +Create your topic branch to be submitted as a pull request from `master`. The, +Spring team will consider your pull request for backporting to maintenance, +versions (e.g. 3.1.2) on a case-by-case basis; you don't need to worry about, +submitting anything for backporting., +, +, +## Use short branch names, +, +Branches used when submitting pull requests should preferably be named, +according to JIRA issues, e.g. 'SPR-1234'. Otherwise, use succinct, lower-case,, +dash (-) delimited names, such as 'fix-warnings', 'fix-typo', etc. In, +[fork-and-edit][] cases, the GitHub default 'patch-1' is fine as well. This is, +important, because branch names show up in the merge commits that result from, +accepting pull requests, and should be as expressive and concise as possible., +, +, +## Mind the whitespace, +, +Please carefully follow the whitespace and formatting conventions already, +present in the framework., +, +1. Tabs, not spaces, +1. Unix (LF), not dos (CRLF) line endings, +1. Eliminate all trailing whitespace, +1. Wrap Javadoc at 90 characters, +1. Aim to wrap code at 90 characters, but favor readability over wrapping, +1. Preserve existing formatting; i.e. do not reformat code for its own sake, +1. Search the codebase using `git grep` and other tools to discover common, +   naming conventions, etc., +1. Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) encoding for Java sources; use `native2ascii` to convert, +   if necessary, +, +, +## Add Apache license header to all new classes, +, +```java, +/*, + * Copyright 2002-2012 the original author or authors., + *, + * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");, + * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License., + * You may obtain a copy of the License at, + *]
