Furthermore, the Servlet, + * container will typically write an HTML error page therefore making the, + * use of a {@code reason} unsuitable for REST APIs. For such cases it is, + * preferable to use a {@link org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity} as, + * a return type and avoid the use of {@code @ResponseStatus} altogether.]
