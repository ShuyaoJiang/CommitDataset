[+++ b/spring-framework-reference/src/beans.xml, +        allows you to specify exactly one id.  Conventionally these names are, +        alphanumeric ('myBean', 'fooService', etc), but may special characters, +        as well.  If you want to introduce other aliases to the bean, you can, +        also specify them in the <literal>name</literal> attribute, separated by, +        a comma (<literal>,</literal>), semicolon (<literal>;</literal>), or, +        white space.  As a historical note, in versions prior to Spring 3.1, the, +        <literal>id</literal> attribute was typed as an, +        <literal>xsd:ID</literal>, which constrained possible characters.  As of, +        3.1, it is now <literal>xsd:string</literal>.  Note that bean id, +        uniqueness is still enforced by the container, though no longer by XML, +        parsers.</para>]
