[+++ b/src/docs/asciidoc/web/websocket.adoc, +When messages are routed to `@MessageMapping` methods, they're matched with, +`AntPathMatcher` and by default patterns are expected to use slash "/" as separator., +This is a good convention in a web applications and similar to HTTP URLs. However if, +you are more used to messaging conventions, you can switch to using dot "." as separator., +			registry.setPathMatcher(**new AntPathMatcher("."));**, +			registry.enableStompBrokerRelay("/queue", "/topic");, +In XML:, +		<websocket:message-broker application-destination-prefix="/app" path-matcher="**pathMatcher**">, +			<websocket:stomp-broker-relay prefix="/topic,/queue" />, +		**, +		**, +After that a controller may use dot "." as separator in `@MessageMapping` methods:, +The client can now send a message to `"/app/foo.bar.baz123"`., +, +In the example above we did not change the prefixes on the "broker relay" because those, +depend entirely on the external message broker. Check the STOMP documentation pages of, +the broker you're using to see what conventions it supports for the destination header., +, +The "simple broker" on the other hand does rely on the configured `PathMatcher` so if, +you switch the separator that will also apply to the broker and the way matches, +destinations from a message to patterns in subscriptions.]
