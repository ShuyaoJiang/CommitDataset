On the other, +hand, suite-level and class-level lifecycle methods — for example, methods annotated with, +JUnit Jupiter's `@BeforeAll` or `@AfterAll` and methods annotated with TestNG's, +`@BeforeSuite`, `@AfterSuite`, `@BeforeClass`, or `@AfterClass` — are _not_ run within a, +test-managed transaction., +, +If you need to execute code in a suite-level or class-level lifecycle method within a, +transaction, you may wish to inject a corresponding `PlatformTransactionManager` into, +your test class and then use that with a `TransactionTemplate` for programmatic, +transaction management.]
