The `RedirectView` in turn calls `HttpServletResponse.sendRedirect()`, +to send an HTTP redirect to the client browser., +If you use `RedirectView` and the view is created by the controller itself, it is, +recommended that you configure the redirect URL to be injected into the controller so, +that it is not baked into the controller but configured in the context along with the, +view names. The <<mvc-redirecting-redirect-prefix>> facilitates this decoupling., +, +[[mvc-redirecting-passing-data]], +===== Passing Data To the Redirect Target, +, +By default all model attributes are considered to be exposed as URI template variables in, +the redirect URL. Of the remaining attributes those that are primitive types or, +collections/arrays of primitive types are automatically appended as query parameters., +controllers the model may contain additional attributes added for rendering purposes (e.g., +drop-down field values). To avoid the possibility of having such attributes appear in the, +URL, an `@RequestMapping` method can declare an argument of type `RedirectAttributes` and, +use it to specify the exact attributes to make available to `RedirectView`. If the method, +does redirect, the content of `RedirectAttributes` is used.  Otherwise the content of the, +model is used., +, +The `RequestMappingHandlerAdapter` provides a flag called, +`"ignoreDefaultModelOnRedirect"` that can be used to indicate the content of the default, +`Model` should never be used if a controller method redirects. Instead the controller, +method should declare an attribute of type `RedirectAttributes` or if it doesn't do so, +no attributes should be passed on to `RedirectView`. Both the MVC namespace and the MVC, +Java config keep this flag set to `false` in order to maintain backwards compatibility., +However, for new applications we recommend setting it to `true`, +Another way of passing data to the redirect target is via __Flash Attributes__. Unlike, +other redirect attributes, flash attributes are saved in the HTTP session (and hence do, +not appear in the URL). See <<mvc-flash-attributes>> for more information., +`RedirectAttributes` are automatically propagated to the "output" FlashMap. Similarly,, +after the redirect, attributes from the "input" `FlashMap` are automatically added to the]
