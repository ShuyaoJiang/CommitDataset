[+++ b/src/asciidoc/index.adoc, +* The existing support for resource handling based on the `ResourceHttpRequestHandler`, +  has been expanded with new abstractions `ResourceResolver`, `ResourceTransformer`,, +  and `ResourceUrlProvider`. A number of built-in implementations provide support, +  for versioned resource URLs (for effective HTTP caching), locating gzipped resources,, +  generating an HTML 5 AppCache manifests, and more., +  and `@MatrixVariable` controller method arguments., +* `ListenableFuture` is supported as a return value alternative to `DeferredResult`, +  where an underlying service (or perhaps a call to `AsyncRestTemplate`) already, +  returns `ListenableFuture`., +* `@ModelAttribute` methods are now invoked in an order that respects inter-dependencies., +  See jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-6299[SPR-6299]., +  controller methods for serializing different amounts of detail for the same POJO (e.g., +  summary vs. detail page). This is also supported with View-based rendering by, +* A new lifecycle option is available for intercepting `@ResponseBody` and `ResponseEntity`, +  methods just after the controller method returns and before the response is written., +  To take advantage declare an `@ControllerAdvice` bean that implements `ResponseBodyAdvice`., +  The built-in support for `@JsonView` and JSONP take advantage of this., +* There are three new `HttpMessageConverter` options:, +** Jackson based XML serialization is now supported through the, +  https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml[jackson-dataformat-xml] extension., +  When using `@EnableWebMvc` or `<mvc:annotation-driven/>`, this is used by default, +  instead of JAXB2 if `jackson-dataformat-xml` is in the classpath., +* Views such as JSPs can now build links to controllers by referring to controller mappings, +  by name. A default name is assigned to every `@RequestMapping`. For example `FooController`, +  with method `handleFoo` is named "FC#handleFoo". The naming strategy is pluggable., +  It is also possible to name an `@RequestMapping` explicitly through its name attribute., +  A new `mvcUrl` function in the Spring JSP tag library makes this easy to use in JSP pages., +* `ResponseEntity` provides a builder-style API to guide controller methods, +* `RequestEntity` is a new type that provides a builder-style API to guide client-side REST, +  code towards the preparation of HTTP requests., +** View resolvers can now be configured including support for content, +   negotiation, see <<mvc-config-view-resolvers>>., +** View controllers now have built-in support for redirects and for setting the response, +   status. An application can use this to configure redirect URLs, render 404 responses, +   with a view, send "no content" responses, etc., +   Some use cases are, +   https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-11543?focusedCommentId=100308&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-100308[listed here]., +** Path matching customizations are frequently used and now built-in., +   See <<mvc-config-path-matching>>., +  support (based on Groovy 2.3). See the `GroovyMarkupConfigurer` and respecitve, +  `ViewResolver` and `View' implementations., +, +=== WebSocket STOMP Messaging Improvements, +, +* SockJS (Java) client-side support. See `SockJsClient` and classes in same package., +* New application context events `SessionSubscribeEvent` and `SessionUnubscribeEvent` published, +  when STOMP clients subscribe and unsubscribe., +* New "websocket" scope. See <<websocket-stomp-websocket-scope>>., +* `@SendToUser` can target only a single session and does not require an authenticated user., +* `@MessageMapping` methods can use dot "." instead of slash "/" as path separator., +  See https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-11660[SPR-11660]., +* STOMP/WebSocket monitoring info collected and logged. See <<websocket-stomp-stats>>., +* Significantly optimized and improved logging that should remain very readable, +  and compact even at DEBUG level., +* Optimized message creation including support for temporary message mutability, +  and avoiding automatic message id and timestamp creation. See Javadoc of, +  `MessageHeaderAccessor`., +* STOMP/WebSocket connections that have not activity 60 seconds after the WebSocket, +  session is established.
