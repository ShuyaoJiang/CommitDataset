[+++ b/src/docs/asciidoc/web/websocket.adoc, +The above events reflect points in the lifecycle of a STOMP connection. They're not meant, +to provide notification for every message sent from the client. Instead an application, +can register a `ChannelInterceptor` to intercept every incoming and outgoing STOMP message., +For example to intercept inbound messages:, +A custom `ChannelInterceptor` can use `StompHeaderAccessor` or `SimpMessageHeaderAccessor`, +Note that just like with the `SesionDisconnectEvent` above, a DISCONNECT message, +may have been sent from the client, or it may also be automatically generated when, +the WebSocket session is closed. In some cases an interceptor may intercept this, +message more than once per session. Components should be idempotent with regard to, +multiple disconnect events., +]
