[+++ b/src/asciidoc/index.adoc, +Note that when declaring a ++BeanPostProcessor++ using an `@Bean` factory method on a, +configuration class, the return type of the factory method should be the implementation, +class itself or at least the `org.springframework.beans.factory.config.BeanPostProcessor`, +interface, clearly indicating the post-processor nature of that bean. Otherwise, the, +`ApplicationContext` won't be able to autodetect it by type before fully creating it., +Since a ++BeanPostProcessor++ needs to be instantiated early in order to apply to the, +initialization of other beans in the context, this early type detection is critical., +]
