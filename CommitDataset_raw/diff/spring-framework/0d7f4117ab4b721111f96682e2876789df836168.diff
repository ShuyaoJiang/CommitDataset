[+++ b/spring-framework-reference/src/validation.xml, +				Beginning with Spring 3, Spring MVC has the ability to automatically validate @Controller inputs., +				In previous versions it was up to the developer to manually invoke validation logic., +					To trigger validation of a @Controller input, simply annotate the input argument as @Valid:, +					With this configuration, anytime a @Valid @Controller input is encountered, it will be validated by the JSR-303 provider., +					JSR-303, in turn, will enforce any constraints declared against the input.]
