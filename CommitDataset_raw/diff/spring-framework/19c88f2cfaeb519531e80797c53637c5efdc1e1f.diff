[+++ b/src/docs/asciidoc/core/core-beans.adoc, +=== Generating an index of candidate components, +While classpath scanning is very fast, it is possible to improve the startup performance, +of large applications by creating a static list of candidates at compilation time. In this, +mode, _all modules_ of the application must use this mechanism as, when the, +`ApplicationContext` detects such index, it will automatically use it rather than scanning, +the classpath., +[NOTE], +====, +When working with this mode in your IDE, the `spring-context-indexer` must be registered, +as an annotation processor to make sure the index is up to date when candidate components, +are updated., +====, +]
