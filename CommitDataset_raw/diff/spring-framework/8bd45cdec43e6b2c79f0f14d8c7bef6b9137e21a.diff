This, +document describes how to contribute documentation updates., +You can build the documentation using Gradle using the `asciidoctor` task. For example,, +from the project root execute the following command:, +[indent=0], +----, +----, +[indent=0], +* If you are using LiveReload, make sure to select _Allow access to file URLs_ in the, +LiveEdit plugin options of your browser., +* The icon used to enable _LiveReload_ can be a bit confusing. The dot is empty when it, +is disabled and full when the plugin is active. Make sure to enable it on the tab, +displaying the `index.html` file., +* Ensure you are _not_ running `guard start` at all as two instances could not run at the, +same time. To exit a current session in a clean way, type `e` in the shell.]
