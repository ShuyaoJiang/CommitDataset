[+++ b/src/asciidoc/whats-new.adoc, +* Spring Framework 4.2 introduces first-class support for declaring and, +  looking up aliases for annotation attributes. The new `@AliasFor`, +  annotation can be used to declare a pair of aliased attributes within, +  a single annotation or to declare an alias from one attribute in a, +  custom composed annotation to an attribute in a meta-annotation., +** The following annotations have been retrofitted with `@AliasFor`, +   support: `@ManagedResource`, `@ContextConfiguration`,, +   `@ActiveProfiles`, `@TestExecutionListeners`, `@TestPropertySource`,, +   `@Sql`, `@ControllerAdvice`, `@RequestMapping`., +** For example, `@ContextConfiguration` from the `spring-test` module, +   is now declared as follows:, +[source,java,indent=0], +[subs="verbatim,quotes"], +----, +public @interface ContextConfiguration {, + , +    @AliasFor(attribute = "locations"), +    String[] value() default {};, + , +    @AliasFor(attribute = "value"), +    String[] locations() default {};, + , +    // ..., +}, +----, +** Similarly, _composed annotations_ that override attributes from, +   meta-annotations can now use `@AliasFor` for fine-grained control, +   over exactly which attributes are overridden within an annotation, +   hierarchy. In fact, it is now possible to declare an alias for the, +   `value` attribute of a meta-annotation., +** For example, one can now develop a composed annotation with a custom , +   attribute override as follows., +[source,java,indent=0], +[subs="verbatim,quotes"], +----, +@ContextConfiguration, +public @interface MyTestConfig {, + , +    @AliasFor(annotation = ContextConfiguration.class, attribute = "locations"), +    String[] xmlFiles();, + , +    // ..., +}, +----, +* Numerous improvements to Spring's search algorithms used for finding, +  meta-annotations. For example, locally declared _composed annotations_, +  are now favored over inherited annotations., +* _Composed annotations_ that override attributes from meta-annotations, +  can now be discovered on interfaces and on abstract, bridge, & interface, +  methods as well as on classes, standard methods, constructors, and , +  fields., +* Apache `commons-pool2` is now supported., +* `@NumberFormat` can now be used as a meta-annotation.]
