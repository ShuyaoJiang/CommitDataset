We have, +    done our best to still keep the code backwards compatible. We now have, +    consistent use of generic Collections and Maps, consistent use of generic, +    FactoryBeans, and also consistent resolution of bridge methods in the, +    Spring AOP API. Generic ApplicationListeners automatically receive, +    specific event types only. All callback interfaces such as, +    TransactionCallback and HibernateCallback declare a generic result value, +    now. Overall, the Spring core codebase is now freshly revised and, +    optimized for Java 5.</para>, +, +    <para>Spring's TaskExecutor abstraction has been updated for close, +    integration with Java 5's java.util.concurrent facilities. We provide, +    first-class support for Callables and Futures now, as well as, +    ExecutorService adapters, ThreadFactory integration, etc. This has been, +    aligned with JSR-236 (Concurrency Utilities for Java EE 6) as far as, +    possible.
