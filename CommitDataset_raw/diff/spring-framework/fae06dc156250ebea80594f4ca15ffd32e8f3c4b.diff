[+++ b/spring-framework-reference/src/testing.xml, +      <para>The Spring Framework provides first class support for, +      integration testing in, +      the <filename class="libraryfile">spring-test</filename> module., +      The name of the actual jar file might include the the release, +      version and might also be in the, +      long <filename>org.springframework.test</filename> form,, +      depending on where you got it from (see, +      the <link linkend="dependency-management">section on Dependency, +      Management</link> for an explanation). This library includes, +      the <literal>org.springframework.test</literal> package, which, +      contains valuable classes for integration testing with a Spring, +      container. This testing does not rely on an application server, +      or other deployment environment. Such tests are slower to run, +      than unit tests but much faster to than the equivalent Cactus, +      tests or remote tests that rely on deployment to an application, +      server.</para>]
