[+++ b/src/asciidoc/core-expressions.adoc, +, +The types of literal expressions supported are strings, numeric values (int, real, hex),, +boolean and null. Strings are delimited by single quotes. To put a single quote itself, +in a string, use two single quote characters., +, +The following listing shows simple usage of literals. Typically they would not be used, +in isolation like this but rather as part of a more complex expression, for example, +using a literal on one side of a logical comparison operator., +[NOTE], +====, +Greater/less-than comparisons against `null` follow a simple rule: `null` is treated as, +nothing here (i.e. NOT as zero). As a consequence, any other value is always greater, +than `null` (`X > null` is always `true`) and no other value is ever less than nothing, +(`X < null` is always `false`)., +, +If you prefer numeric comparisons instead, please avoid number-based `null` comparisons, +in favor of comparisons against zero (e.g. `X > 0` or `X < 0`)., +====, +]
