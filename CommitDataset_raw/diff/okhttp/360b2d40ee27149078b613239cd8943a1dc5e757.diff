[+++ b/CHANGELOG.md, +## Version 3.9.0, +, +_2017-09-03_, +, + *  **Interceptors are more capable.** The `Chain` interface now offers access, +    to the call and can adjust all call timeouts. Note that this change is, +    source-incompatible for code that implements the `Chain` interface., +    We don't expect this to be a problem in practice., +, + *  **OkHttp has an experimental new API for tracking metrics.** The new, +    `EventListener` API is designed to help developers monitor HTTP requests', +    size and duration. This feature is an API preview: the API is subject to, +    change, and the implementation is incomplete. Please try out the API and, +    provide feedback to us. Because this is a big new API we are unlikely to, +    get all of the details right and we're eager for feedback., +, + *  New: Support ALPN via Google Play Services' Dynamic Security Provider. This, +    expands HTTP/2 support to older Android devices that have Google Play, +    Services., + *  New: Consider all routes when looking for candidate coalesced connections., +    This increases the likelihood that HTTP/2 connections will be shared., + *  New: Authentication challenges and credentials now use a charset. Use this in, +    your authenticator to support user names and passwords with non-ASCII, +    characters., + *  New: Accept a charset in `FormBody.Builder`. Previously form bodies were, +    always UTF-8., + *  New: Support the `immutable` cache-control directive., + *  Fix: Don't crash when an HTTP/2 call is redirected while the connection is, +    being shut down., + *  Fix: Don't drop headers of healthy streams that raced with `GOAWAY` frames., +    This bug would cause HTTP/2 streams to occasional hang when the connection, +    was shutting down., + *  Fix: Honor `OkHttpClient.retryOnConnectionFailure()` when the response is a, +    HTTP 408 Request Timeout. If retries are enabled, OkHttp will retry exactly, +    once in response to a 408., + *  Fix: Don't crash when reading the empty `HEAD` response body if it specifies, +    a `Content-Length`., + *  Fix: Don't crash if the thread is interrupted while reading the public, +    suffix database., + *  Fix: Use relative resource path when loading the public suffix database., +    Loading the resource using a path relative to the class prevents conflicts, +    when the OkHttp classes are relocated (shaded) by allowing multiple private, +    copies of the database., + *  Fix: Accept cookies for URLs that have an IPv6 address for a host., + *  Fix: Don't log the protocol (HTTP/1.1, h2) in HttpLoggingInterceptor if the, +    protocol isn't negotiated yet! Previously we'd log HTTP/1.1 by default, and, +    this was confusing., + *  Fix: Omit the message from MockWebServer's HTTP/2 `:status` header., + *  Fix: Handle 'Expect: 100 Continue' properly in MockWebServer., +, +]
