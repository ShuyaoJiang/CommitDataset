[+++ b/CHANGELOG.md, +## Version 3.13.0, +, +_2018-02-02_, +, + *  **This release bumps our minimum requirements to Java 8+ or Android 5+.** Cutting off old, +    devices is a serious change and we don't do it lightly! [This post][require_android_5] explains, +    why we're doing this and how to upgrade., +, +    The OkHttp 3.12.x branch will be our long-term branch for Android 2.3+ (API level 9+) and Java, +    7+. These platforms lack support for TLS 1.2 and should not be used. But because upgrading is, +    difficult we will backport critical fixes to the 3.12.x branch through December 31, 2020., +, + *  **TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 are no longer enabled by default.** Major web browsers are working towards, +    removing these versions altogether in early 2020. If your servers aren't ready yet you can, +    configure OkHttp 3.13 to allow TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 connections:, +, +    ```, +    OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient.Builder(), +        .connectionSpecs(Arrays.asList(ConnectionSpec.COMPATIBLE_TLS)), +        .build();, +    ```, +, + *  New: You can now access HTTP trailers with `Response.trailers()`. This method may only be called, +    after the entire HTTP response body has been read., +, + *  New: Upgrade to Okio 1.17.3. If you're on Kotlin-friendly Okio 2.x this release requires 2.2.2, +    or newer., +, +    ```kotlin, +    implementation("com.squareup.okio:okio:1.17.3"), +    ```, +, + *  Fix: Don't miss cancels when sending HTTP/2 request headers., + *  Fix: Don't miss whole operation timeouts when calls redirect., + *  Fix: Don't leak connections if web sockets have malformed responses or if `onOpen()` throws., + *  Fix: Don't retry when request bodies fail due to `FileNotFoundException`., + *  Fix: Don't crash when URLs have IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses., + *  Fix: Don't crash when building `HandshakeCertificates` on Android API 28., + *  Fix: Permit multipart file names to contain non-ASCII characters., + *  New: API to get MockWebServer's dispatcher., + *  New: API to access headers as `java.time.Instant`., + *  New: Fail fast if a `SSLSocketFactory` is used as a `SocketFactory`., + *  New: Log the TLS handshake in `LoggingEventListener`., +, +, + [require_android_5]: https://medium.com/square-corner-blog/okhttp-3-13-requires-android-5-XXXXXXXXXXXX]
