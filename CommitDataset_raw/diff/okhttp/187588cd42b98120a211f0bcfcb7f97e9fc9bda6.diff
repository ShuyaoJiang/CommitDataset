[+++ b/CHANGELOG.md, +## VERSION 2.1.0-RC1, +, +_2014-11-04_, +, + *  **OkHttp now caches private responses**. We've changed from a shared cache, +    to a private cache, and will now store responses that use an `Authorization`, +    header. This means OkHttp's cache shouldn't be used on middleboxes that sit, +    between user agents and the origin server., +, + *  **TLS configuration updated.** OkHttp now explicitly enables TLSv1.2,, +    TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.0 where they are supported. It will continue to perform, +    only one fallback, to SSLv3. Applications can now configure this with the, +    `ConnectionConfiguration` class., +, +    To disable TLS fallback:, +, +    ```, +    client.setConnectionConfigurations(Arrays.asList(, +        ConnectionConfiguration.MODERN_TLS, ConnectionConfiguration.CLEARTEXT));, +    ```, +, +    To disable cleartext connections, permitting `https` URLs only:, +, +    ```, +    client.setConnectionConfigurations(Arrays.asList(, +        ConnectionConfiguration.MODERN_TLS, ConnectionConfiguration.COMPATIBLE_TLS));, +    ```, +, + *  **New cipher suites.** Please confirm that your webservers are reachable, +    with this limited set of cipher suites., +, +    ```, +                                             Android, +    Name                                     Version, +, +    TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256  5.0, +    TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256    5.0, +    TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256      5.0, +    TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA     4.0, +    TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA     4.0, +    TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA       4.0, +    TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA       4.0, +    TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA         4.0, +    TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA           4.0, +    TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA         2.3, +    TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA         2.3, +    TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA         2.3, +    TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256          5.0, +    TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA             2.3, +    TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA             2.3, +    SSL_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA            2.3  (Deprecated in 5.0), +    SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA                 2.3, +    SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5                 2.3  (Deprecated in 5.0), +    ```, +, + *  **Okio updated to 1.0.1.**, +, +    ```, +    <dependency>, +      <groupId>com.squareup.okio</groupId>, +      <artifactId>okio</artifactId>, +      <version>1.0.1</version>, +    </dependency>, +    ```, +, + *  **New APIs to permit easy certificate pinning.** Be warned, certificate, +    pinning is dangerous and could prevent your application from trusting your, +    server!, +, + *  **Cache improvements.** This release fixes some severe cache problems, +    including a bug where the cache could be corrupted upon certain access, +    patterns. We also fixed a bug where the cache was being cleared due to a, +    corrupted journal. We've added APIs to configure a request's `Cache-Control`, +    headers, and to manually clear the cache., +, + *  **Request cancellation fixes.** This update fixes a bug where synchronous, +    requests couldn't be canceled by tag. This update avoids crashing when, +    `onResponse()` throws an `IOException`. That failure will now be logged, +    instead of notifying the thread's uncaught exception handler. We've added a, +    new API, `Call.isCanceled()` to check if a call has been canceled., +, + *  New: Update `MultipartBuilder` to support content length., + *  New: Make it possible to mock `OkHttpClient` and `Call`., + *  New: Update to h2-14 and hpack-9., + *  New: OkHttp includes a user-agent by default, like `okhttp/2.1.0-RC1`., + *  Fix: Handle response code `308 Permanent Redirect`., + *  Fix: Don't skip the callback if a call is canceled., + *  Fix: Permit hostnames with underscores., + *  Fix: Permit overriding the content-type in `OkApacheClient`., + *  Fix: Use the socket factory for direct connections., + *  Fix: Honor `OkUrlFactory` APIs that disable redirects., + *  Fix: Don't crash on concurrent modification of `SPDY` SPDY settings., +, +++ b/CHANGELOG.md, +## VERSION 2.1.0-RC1, +, +_2014-11-04_, +, + *  **OkHttp now caches private responses**.
