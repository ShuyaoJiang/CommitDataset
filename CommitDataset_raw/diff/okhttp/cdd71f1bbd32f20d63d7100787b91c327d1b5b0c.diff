[+++ b/CHANGELOG.md, +## Version 2.0.0-RC2, +, +_2014-06-11_, +, +This update fixes problems in 2.0.0-RC1. Read the 2.0.0-RC1 changes for, +advice on upgrading from 1.x to 2.x., +, + *  Fix: Don't leak connections! There was a regression in 2.0.0-RC1 where, +    connections were neither closed nor pooled., + *  Fix: Revert builder-style return types from OkHttpClient's timeout methods, +    for binary compatibility with OkHttp 1.x., + *  Fix: Don't skip client stream 1 on SPDY/3.1. This fixes SPDY connectivity to, +    `https://google.com`, which doesn't follow the SPDY/3.1 spec!, + *  Fix: Always configure NPN headers. This fixes connectivity to, +    `https://facebook.com` when SPDY and HTTP/2 are both disabled. Otherwise an, +    unexpected NPN response is received and OkHttp crashes., + *  Fix: Write continuation frames when HPACK data is larger than 16383 bytes., + *  Fix: Don't drop uncaught exceptions thrown in async calls., + *  Fix: Throw an exception eagerly when a request body is not legal. Previously, +    we ignored the problem at request-building time, only to crash later with a, +    `NullPointerException`., + *  Fix: Include a backwards-compatible `OkHttp-Response-Source` header with, +    `OkUrlFactory `responses., + *  Fix: Don't include a default User-Agent header in requests made with the Call, +    API. Requests made with OkUrlFactory will continue to have a default user, +    agent., + *  New: Guava-like API to create headers:, +, +    ```, +    Headers headers = Headers.of(name1, value1, name2, value2, ...)., +    ```, +, + *  New: Make the content-type header optional for request bodies., + *  New: `Response.isSuccessful()` is a convenient API to check response codes., + *  New: The response body can now be read outside of the callback. Response, +    bodies must always be closed, otherwise they will leak connections!, + *  New: APIs to create multipart request bodies (`MultipartBuilder`) and form, +    encoding bodies (`FormEncodingBuilder`)., +, +++ b/CHANGELOG.md, +## Version 2.0.0-RC2, +, +_2014-06-11_, +, +This update fixes problems in 2.0.0-RC1.
