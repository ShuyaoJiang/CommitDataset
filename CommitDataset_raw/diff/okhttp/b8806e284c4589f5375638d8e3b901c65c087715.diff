[+++ b/CHANGELOG.md, +## Version 3.10.0, +, +_2018-02-24_, +, + *  **The pingInterval() feature now aggressively checks connectivity for web, +    sockets and HTTP/2 connections.**, +, +    Previously if you configured a ping interval that would cause OkHttp to send, +    pings, but it did not track whether the reply pongs were received. With this, +    update OkHttp requires that every ping receive a response: if it does not, +    the connection will be closed and the listener's `onFailure()` method will, +    be called., +, +    Web sockets have always been had pings, but pings on HTTP/2 connections is, +    new in this release. Pings are used for connections that are busy carrying, +    calls and for idle connections in the connection pool. (Pings do not impact, +    when pooled connections are evicted)., +, +    If you have a configured ping interval, you should confirm that it is long, +    enough for a roundtrip from client to server. If your ping interval is too, +    short, slow connections may be misinterpreted as failed connections. A ping, +    interval of 30 seconds is reasonable for most use cases., +, + *  **OkHttp now supports [Conscrypt][conscrypt].** Conscrypt is a Java Security, +    Provider that integrates BoringSSL into the Java platform., +, +    OkHttp will use Conscrypt if you set the `okhttp.platform` system property, +    to `conscrypt`., +, +    Alternatively, OkHttp will also use Conscrypt if you install it as your, +    preferred security provider. To do so, add the following code to execute, +    before you create your `OkHttpClient`., +, +    ```, +    Security.insertProviderAt(, +        new org.conscrypt.OpenSSLProvider(), 1);, +    ```, +, +    Conscrypt is the bundled security provider on Android so it is not necessary, +    to configure it on that platform., +, + *  New: `HttpUrl.addQueryParameter()` percent-escapes more characters., +    Previously several ASCII punctuation characters were not percent-escaped, +    when used with this method. This does not impact already-encoded query, +    parameters in APIs like `HttpUrl.parse()` and, +    `HttpUrl.Builder.addEncodedQueryParameter()`., + *  New: CBC-mode ECDSA cipher suites have been removed from OkHttp's default, +    configuration: `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA` and, +    `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA`. This tracks a [Chromium, +    change][remove_cbc_ecdsa] to remove these cipher suites because they are, +    fragile and rarely-used., + *  New: Don't fall back to common name (CN) verification for hostnames. This, +    behavior was deprecated with RFC 2818 in May 2000 and was recently dropped, +    from major web browsers., + *  New: Honor the `Retry-After` response header. HTTP 503 (Unavailable), +    responses are retried automatically if this header is present and its delay, +    is 0 seconds. HTTP 408 (Client Timeout) responses are retried automatically, +    if the header is absent or its delay is 0 seconds., + *  New: Allow request bodies for all HTTP methods except GET and HEAD., + *  New: Automatic module name of `okhttp3` for use with the Java Platform, +    Module System., + *  New: Log gzipped bodies when `HttpLoggingInterceptor` is used as a network, +    interceptor., + *  New: `Protocol.QUIC` constant. This protocol is not supported but this, +    constant is included for completeness., + *  New: Upgrade to Okio 1.14.0., +, +     ```xml, +     <dependency>, +       <groupId>com.squareup.okio</groupId>, +       <artifactId>okio</artifactId>, +       <version>1.14.0</version>, +     </dependency>, +, +     com.squareup.okio:okio:1.14.0, +     ```, +, + *  Fix: Handle `HTTP/1.1 100 Continue` status lines, even on requests that did, +    not send the `Expect: continue` request header., + *  Fix: Do not count web sockets toward the dispatcher's per-host connection, +    limit., + *  Fix: Avoid using invalid HTTPS sessions. This prevents OkHttp from crashing, +    with the error, `Unexpected TLS version: NONE`., + *  Fix: Don't corrupt the response cache when a 304 (Not Modified) response, +    overrides the stored "Content-Encoding" header., + *  Fix: Gracefully shut down the HTTP/2 connection before it exhausts the, +    namespace of stream IDs (~536 million streams)., + *  Fix: Never pass a null `Route` to `Authenticator`. There was a bug where, +    routes were omitted for eagerly-closed connections., +, + [remove_cbc_ecdsa]: https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/12/chrome-56-deprecations#remove_cbc-mode_ecdsa_ciphers_in_tls, + [conscrypt]: https://github.com/google/conscrypt/]
