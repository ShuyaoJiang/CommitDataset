[+++ b/CHANGELOG.md, +## Version 3.1.0, +, +_2016-02-06_, +, + *  New: WebSockets now defer some writes. This should improve performance for, +    some applications., + *  New: Override `equals()` and `hashCode()` in our new cookie class. This, +    class now defines equality by value rather than by reference., + *  New: Handle 408 responses by retrying the request. This allows servers to, +    direct clients to retry rather than failing permanently., + *  New: Expose the framed protocol in `Connection`. Previously this would, +    return the application-layer protocol (HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/1.0); now it always, +    returns the wire-layer protocol (HTTP/2, SPDY/3.1, or HTTP/1.1)., + *  Fix: Permit the trusted CA root to be pinned by `CertificatePinner`., + *  Fix: Silently ignore unknown HTTP/2 settings. Previously this would cause, +    the entire connection to fail., + *  Fix: Don’t crash on unexpected charsets in the logging interceptor., + *  Fix: `OkHttpClient` is now non-final for the benefit of mocking frameworks., +    Mocking sophisticated classes like `OkHttpClient` is fragile and you, +    shouldn’t do it. But if that’s how you want to live your life we won’t stand, +    in your way!, +, +]
