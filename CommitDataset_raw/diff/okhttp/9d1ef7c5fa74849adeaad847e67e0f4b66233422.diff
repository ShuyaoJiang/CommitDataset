Each response body is supported by an active connection to the webserver. This, + * imposes both obligations and limits on the client application., + *, + * <h3>The response body must be closed.</h3>, + *, + * <p>Each response body is backed by a limited resource like a socket (live network responses) or, + * an open file (for cached responses). Failing to close the response body will leak these resources, + * and may ultimately cause the application to slow down or crash. Close the response body by, + * calling either {@link ResponseBody#close close()}, {@link InputStream#close(), + * byteStream().close()}, or {@link Reader#close() reader().close()}. The {@link #bytes()} and, + * {@link #string()} methods both close the response body automatically., + *, + * <h3>The response body can be consumed only once.</h3>, + *, + * <p>This class may be used to stream very large responses. For example, it is possible to use this, + * class to read a response that is larger than the entire memory allocated to the current process., + * It can even stream a response larger than the total storage on the current device, which is a, + * common requirement for video streaming applications., + *, + * <p>Because this class does not buffer the full response in memory, the application may not, + * re-read the bytes of the response. Use this one shot to read the entire response into memory with, + * {@link #bytes()} or {@link #string()}. Or stream the response with either {@link #source()},, + * {@link #byteStream()}, or {@link #charStream()}., + */]
