[+++ b/CHANGELOG.md, +## VERSION 2.2.0, +, +_2014-12-30_, +, + *  **`RequestBody.contentLength()` now throws `IOException`.**, +    This is a source-incompatible change. If you have code that calls, +    `RequestBody.contentLength()`, your compile will break with this, +    update. The change is binary-compatible, however: code compiled, +    for OkHttp 2.0 and 2.1 will continue work with this update., +, + *  **`COMPATIBLE_TLS` no longer supports SSLv3.** In response to the, +    [POODLE](http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.ca/2014/10/this-poodle-bites-exploiting-ssl-30.html), +    vulnerability, OkHttp no longer offers SSLv3 when negotiation an, +    HTTPS connection. If you continue to need to connect to webservers, +    running SSLv3, you must manually configure your own `ConnectionSpec`., +, + *  **OkHttp now offers interceptors.** Interceptors are a powerful mechanism, +    that can monitor, rewrite, and retry calls. The [project, +    wiki](https://github.com/square/okhttp/wiki/Interceptors) has a full, +    introduction to this new API., +, + *  New: APIs to iterate and selectively clear the response cache., + *  New: Support for SOCKS proxies., + *  New: Support for `TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV`., + *  New: Update HTTP/2 support to to `h2-16` and `hpack-10`., + *  New: APIs to prevent retrying non-idempotent requests., + *  Fix: Drop NPN support. Going forward we support ALPN only., + *  Fix: The hostname verifier is now strict. This is consistent with the hostname, +    verifier in modern browsers., + *  Fix: Improve `CONNECT` handling for misbehaving HTTP proxies., + *  Fix: Don't retry requests that failed due to timeouts., + *  Fix: Cache 302s and 308s that include appropriate response headers., + *  Fix: Improve pooling of connections that use proxy selectors., + *  Fix: Don't leak connections when using ALPN on the desktop., + *  Fix: Update Jetty ALPN to `7.1.2.v20141202` (Java 7) and 8.1.2.v20141202 (Java 8)., +    This fixes a bug in resumed TLS sessions where the wrong protocol could be, +    selected., + *  Fix: Don't crash in SPDY and HTTP/2 when disconnecting before connecting., + *  Fix: Avoid a reverse DNS-lookup for a numeric proxy address, + *  Fix: Resurrect http/2 frame logging., + *  Fix: Limit to 20 authorization attempts., +]
