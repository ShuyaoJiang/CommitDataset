[+++ b/README.md, +An HTTP & HTTP/2 client for Android and Java applications. For more information see [the, +website][website] and [the wiki][wiki]., +, +, +Requirements, +------------, +, +OkHttp works on Android 5.0+ (API level 21+) and on Java 8+., +, +OkHttp has one library dependency on [Okio][okio], a small library for high-performance I/O. It, +works with either Okio 1.x (implemented in Java) or Okio 2.x (upgraded to Kotlin)., +, +We highly recommend you keep OkHttp up-to-date. As with auto-updating web browsers, staying current, +with HTTPS clients is an important defense against potential security problems. [We, +track][tls_history] the dynamic TLS ecosystem and adjust OkHttp to improve connectivity and, +security., +, +OkHttp uses your platform's built-in TLS implementation. On Java platforms OkHttp also supports, +[Conscrypt][conscrypt], which integrates BoringSSL with Java. OkHttp will use Conscrypt if it is, +the first security provider:, +, +```java, +Security.insertProviderAt(Conscrypt.newProvider(), 1);, +```, +, +The OkHttp 3.12.x branch supports Android 2.3+ (API level 9+) and Java 7+. These platforms lack, +support for TLS 1.2 and should not be used. But because upgrading is difficult we will backport, +critical fixes to the [3.12.x branch][okhttp_312x] through December 31, 2020., +Download [the latest JAR][okhttp_latest_jar] or configure this dependency:, +Download [the latest JAR][mockwebserver_latest_jar] or configure this dependency:, +If you are using R8 or ProGuard add the options from [`okhttp3.pro`][okhttp3_pro]., + [conscrypt]: https://github.com/google/conscrypt/, + [mockwebserver_latest_jar]: https://search.maven.org/remote_content?g=com.squareup.okhttp3&a=mockwebserver&v=LATEST, + [okhttp_312x]: https://github.com/square/okhttp/tree/okhttp_3.12.x, + [okhttp_latest_jar]: https://search.maven.org/remote_content?g=com.squareup.okhttp3&a=okhttp&v=LATEST, + [okio]: https://github.com/square/okio/, + [tls_history]: https://github.com/square/okhttp/wiki/TLS-Configuration-History, + [website]: https://square.github.io/okhttp, + [wiki]: https://github.com/square/okhttp/wiki, + [okhttp3_pro]: https://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/master/okhttp/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/okhttp3.pro]
