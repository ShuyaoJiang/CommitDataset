[+++ b/okhttp/src/main/java/okhttp3/Connection.java, + * <p>Each connection can carry a varying number of streams, depending on the underlying protocol, + * being used. HTTP/1.x connections can carry either zero or one streams. HTTP/2 connections can, + * carry any number of streams, dynamically configured with {@code SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS}., + * A connection currently carrying zero streams is an idle stream. We keep it alive because reusing, + * an existing connection is typically faster than establishing a new one.]
