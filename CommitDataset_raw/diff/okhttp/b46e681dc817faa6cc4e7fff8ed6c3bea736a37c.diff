[+++ b/CHANGELOG.md, +## Version 2.3.0, +, +_2015-03-16_, +, + *  **HTTP/2 support.** We've done interop testing and haven't seen any, +    problems. HTTP/2 support has been a big effort and we're particularly, +    thankful to Adrian Cole who has helped us to reach this milestone., +, + *  **RC4 cipher suites are no longer supported by default.** To connect to, +    old, obsolete servers relying on these cipher suites, you must create a, +    custom `ConnectionSpec`., +, + *  **Beta WebSockets support.**. The `okhttp-ws` subproject offers a new, +    websockets client. Please try it out! When it's ready we intend to include, +    it with the core OkHttp library., +, + *  **Okio updated to 1.3.0.**, +, +    ```, +    <dependency>, +      <groupId>com.squareup.okio</groupId>, +      <artifactId>okio</artifactId>, +      <version>1.3.0</version>, +    </dependency>, +    ```, +, + *  **Fix: improve parallelism of async requests.** OkHttp's Dispatcher had a, +    misconfigured `ExecutorService` that limited the number of worker threads., +    If you're using `Call.enqueue()` this update should significantly improve, +    request concurrency., +, + *  **Fix: Lazily initialize the response cache.** This avoids strict mode, +    warnings when initializing OkHttp on Androidâ€˜s main thread., +, + *  **Fix: Disable ALPN on Android 4.4.** That release of the feature was, +    unstable and prone to native crashes in the underlying OpenSSL code., + *  Fix: Don't send both `If-None-Match` and `If-Modified-Since` cache headers, +    when both are applicable., + *  Fix: Fail early when a port is out of range., + *  Fix: Offer `Content-Length` headers for multipart request bodies., + *  Fix: Throw `UnknownServiceException` if a cleartext connection is attempted, +    when explicitly forbidden., + *  Fix: Throw a `SSLPeerUnverifiedException` when host verification fails., + *  Fix: MockWebServer explicitly closes sockets. (On some Android releases,, +    closing the input stream and output stream of a socket is not sufficient., + *  Fix: Buffer outgoing HTTP/2 frames to limit how many outgoing frames are, +    created., + *  Fix: Avoid crashing when cache writing fails due to a full disk., + *  Fix: Improve caching of private responses., + *  Fix: Update cache-by-default response codes., + *  Fix: Reused `Request.Builder` instances no longer hold stale URL fields., + *  New: ConnectionSpec can now be configured to use the SSL socket's default, +    cipher suites. To use, set the cipher suites to `null`., + *  New: Support `DELETE` with a request body., + *  New: `Headers.of(Map)` creates headers from a Map., +, +, +## Version 2.2.0, +## Version 2.1.0, +## Version 2.1.0-RC1]
