[+++ b/CHANGELOG.md, +## Version 3.14.0, +, +_RELEASE TBD_, +, + *  **This release deletes the long-deprecated `OkUrlFactory` and `OkApacheClient` APIs.** These, +    facades hide OkHttp's implementation behind another client's API. If you still need this please, +    copy and paste [ObsoleteUrlFactory.java][obsolete_url_factory] or, +    [ObsoleteApacheClient.java][obsolete_apache_client] into your project., +, + *  **OkHttp now supports duplex calls over HTTP/2.** With normal HTTP calls the request must finish, +    before the response starts. With duplex, request and response bodies are transmitted, +    simultaneously. This can be used to implement interactive conversations within a single HTTP, +    call., +, +    Create duplex calls by overriding the new `RequestBody.isDuplex()` method to return true., +    This simple option dramatically changes the behavior of the request body and of the entire, +    call., +, +    The `RequestBody.writeTo()` method may now retain a reference to the provided sink and, +    hand it off to another thread to write to it after `writeTo` returns., +, +    The `EventListener` may now see requests and responses interleaved in ways not previously, +    permitted. For example, a listener may receive `responseHeadersStart()` followed by, +    `requestBodyEnd()`, both on the same call. Such events may be triggered by different threads, +    even for a single call., +, +    Interceptors that rewrite or replace the request body may now inadvertently interfere with, +    duplex request bodies. Such interceptors should check `RequestBody.isDuplex()` and avoid, +    accessing the request body when it is., +, +    Duplex calls require HTTP/2. If HTTP/1 is established instead the duplex call will fail. The, +    most common use of duplex calls is [gRPC][grpc_http2]., +, + *  New: Prevent OkHttp from retransmitting a request body by overriding `RequestBody.isOneShot()`., +    This is most useful when writing the request body is destructive., +, + *  New: We've added `requestFailed()` and `responseFailed()` methods to `EventListener`. These, +    are called instead of `requestBodyEnd()` and `responseBodyEnd()` in some failure situations., +    They may also be fired in cases where no event was published previously. In this release we did, +    an internal rewrite of our event code to fix problems where events were lost or unbalanced., +, + *  Fix: Don't leak a connection when a call is canceled immediately preceding the `onFailure()`, +    callback., +, + *  Fix: Apply call timeouts when connecting duplex calls, web sockets, and server-sent events., +    Once the streams are established no further timeout is enforced., +, + *  Fix: Retain the `Route` when a connection is reused on a redirect or other follow-up. This was, +    causing some `Authenticator` calls to see a null route when non-null was expected., +, + *  Fix: Use the correct key size in the name of `TLS_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256` which is a TLS 1.3, +    cipher suite. We accidentally specified a key size of 256, preventing that cipher suite from, +    being selected for any TLS handshakes. We didn't notice because this cipher suite isn't, +    supported on Android, Java, or Conscrypt., +, +    We removed this cipher suite and `TLS_AES_128_CCM_SHA256` from the restricted, modern, and, +    compatible sets of cipher suites. These two cipher suites aren't enabled by default in either, +    Firefox or Chrome., +, +    See our [TLS Configuration History][tls_configuration_history] tracker for a log of all changes, +    to OkHttp's default TLS options., +, + *  New: Upgrade to Conscrypt 2.0.0. OkHttp works with other versions of Conscrypt but this is the, +    version we're testing against., +, +    ```kotlin, +    implementation("org.conscrypt:conscrypt-openjdk-uber:2.0.0"), +    ```, +, + *  New: Update the embedded public suffixes list., +, +, + [obsolete_apache_client]: https://gist.github.com/swankjesse/09721f72039e3a46cf50f94323deb82d, + [obsolete_url_factory]: https://gist.github.com/swankjesse/dd91c0a8854e1559b00f5fc9c7bfae70, + [tls_configuration_history]: https://github.com/square/okhttp/wiki/TLS-Configuration-History, + [grpc_http2]: https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/PROTOCOL-HTTP2.md]
