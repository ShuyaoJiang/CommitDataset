It causes pain for developers who use OkHttp and sometimes runtime errors.</li>, +                <li>Favour a working external library if appropriate. There are many examples of OkHttp libraries that can sit on top or hook in via existing APIs.</li>, +                <li>Get working code on a personal branch with tests before you submit a PR.</li>, +                <li>OkHttp is a small and light dependency. Don't introduce new dependencies or major new functionality.</li>, +                <li>OkHttp targets the intersection of RFC correct and widely implemented. Incorrect implementations that are very widely implemented e.g. a bug in Apache, Nginx, Google, Firefox should also be handled.</li>, +            </ul>, +            ]
