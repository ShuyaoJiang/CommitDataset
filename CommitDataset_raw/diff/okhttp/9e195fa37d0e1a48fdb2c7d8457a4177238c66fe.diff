[+++ b/CHANGELOG.md, +## Version 3.12.0, +, +_2018-11-16_, +, + *  **OkHttp now supports TLS 1.3.** This requires either Conscrypt or Java 11+., +, + *  **Proxy authenticators are now asked for preemptive authentication.** OkHttp will now request, +    authentication credentials before creating TLS tunnels through HTTP proxies (HTTP `CONNECT`)., +    Authenticators should identify preemptive authentications by the presence of a challenge whose, +    scheme is "OkHttp-Preemptive"., +, + *  **OkHttp now offers full-operation timeouts.** This sets a limit on how long the entire call may, +    take and covers resolving DNS, connecting, writing the request body, server processing, and, +    reading the full response body. If a call requires redirects or retries all must complete within, +    one timeout period., +, +    Use `OkHttpClient.Builder.callTimeout()` to specify the default duration and `Call.timeout()` to, +    specify the timeout of an individual call., +, + *  New: Return values and fields are now non-null unless otherwise annotated., + *  New: `LoggingEventListener` makes it easy to get basic visibility into a call's performance., +    This class is in the `logging-interceptor` artifact., + *  New: `Headers.Builder.addUnsafeNonAscii()` allows non-ASCII values to be added without an, +    immediate exception., + *  New: Headers can be redacted in `HttpLoggingInterceptor`., + *  New: `Headers.Builder` now accepts dates., + *  New: OkHttp now accepts `java.time.Duration` for timeouts on Java 8+ and Android 26+., + *  New: `Challenge` includes all authentication parameters., + *  New: Upgrade to BouncyCastle 1.60, Conscrypt 1.4.0, and Okio 1.15.0.
