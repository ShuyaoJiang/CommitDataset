[+++ b/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md, +Some general advice, +, +- Donâ€™t change public API lightly, avoid if possible, and include your reasoning in the PR if essential.  It causes pain for developers who use OkHttp and sometimes runtime errors., +- Favour a working external library if appropriate.  There are many examples of OkHttp libraries that can sit on top or hook in via existing APIs., +- Get working code on a personal branch with tests before you submit a PR., +- OkHttp is a small and light dependency.  Don't introduce new dependencies or major new functionality., +- OkHttp targets the intersection of RFC correct *and* widely implemented.  Incorrect implementations that are very widely implemented e.g. a bug in Apache, Nginx, Google, Firefox should also be handled., +]
