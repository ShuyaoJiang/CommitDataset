[+++ b/CHANGELOG.md, +## Version 3.4.0-RC1, +, +_2016-07-02_, +, + *  **We’ve rewritten HttpURLConnection and HttpsURLConnection.** Previously we, +    shared a single HTTP engine between two frontend APIs: `HttpURLConnection`, +    and `Call`. With this release we’ve rearranged things so that the, +    `HttpURLConnection` frontend now delegates to the `Call` APIs internally., +    This has enabled substantial simplifications and optimizations in the OkHttp, +    core for both frontends., +, +    For most HTTP requests the consequences of this change will be negligible., +    If your application uses `HttpURLConnection.connect()`,, +    `setFixedLengthStreamingMode()`, or `setChunkedStreamingMode()`, OkHttp will, +    now use a async dispatcher thread to establish the HTTP connection., +, +    We don’t expect this change to have any behavior or performance, +    consequences. Regardless, please exercise your `OkUrlFactory` and, +    `HttpURLConnection` code when applying this update., +, + *  **Cipher suites may now have arbitrary names.** Previously `CipherSuite` was, +    a Java enum and it was impossible to define new cipher suites without first, +    upgrading OkHttp. With this change it is now a regular Java class with, +    enum-like constants. Application code that uses enum methods on cipher, +    suites (`ordinal()`, `name()`, etc.) will break with this change., +, + *  Fix: `CertificatePinner` now matches canonicalized hostnames. Previously, +    this was case sensitive. This change should also make it easier to configure, +    certificate pinning for internationalized domain names., + *  Fix: Don’t crash on non-ASCII `ETag` headers. Previously OkHttp would reject, +    these headers when validating a cached response., + *  Fix: Don’t allow remote peer to arbitrarily size the HPACK decoder dynamic, +    table., + *  Fix: Honor per-host configuration in Android’s network security config., +    Previously disabling cleartext for any host would disable cleartext for all, +    hosts. Note that this setting is only available on Android 24+., + *  New: HPACK compression is now dynamic. This should improve performance when, +    transmitting request headers over HTTP/2., + *  New: `Dispatcher.setIdleCallback()` can be used to signal when there are no, +    calls in flight.
