For example, we often use an open source, +      HTTP client library to retrieve information from an open source web, +      server and to invoke a remote procedure call via web services., +    </para>, +    <para>, +      However, a general purpose protocol or its implementation sometimes , +      doesn't scale very well.  It's like we don't use a general purpose, +      HTTP server to exchange huge files, e-mail messages, and near-realtime, +      messages such as financial information and multiplayer game data., +      What's required is a highly optimized protocol implementation which is, +      dedicated to a special purpose.  For example, you might want to, +      implement an HTTP server which is optimized for AJAX-based chat, +      application.  You could even want to design and implement a whole new, +      protocol which is precisely tailored to your need., +    </para>, +    <para>, +      Another inevitable case is when you have to deal with a legacy, +      proprietary protocol to ensure the interoperability with an old system., +      What matters in this case is how quickly we can implement that protocol, +      while not sacrificing the stability and performance of the resulting, +      application., +    </para>, +  </section>, +  , +  <section>, +    <title>The Solution</title>, +    <para>, +      <firstterm>The Netty project</firstterm> is an effort to provide an, +      asynchronous &middot; event-driven network application framework and, +      tooling for rapid development of maintainable high-performance &middot;, +      high-scalability protocol servers and clients.  To simplify, Netty, +      helps you to write your own network application very easily -- it's, +      often called <firstterm>rapid network application development</firstterm>., +    </para>, +    <para>, +      Rapid network application development doesn't mean that a resulting, +      application will suffer from a maintainability or a performance issue., +      Netty has been designed carefully with the experiences earned from , +      the implementation of a lot of protocols such as FTP, SMTP, HTTP, and, +      various binary and text-based legacy protocols.  As a result, Netty, +      has succeeded to find a way to achieve ease of development,, +      performance, stability, and flexibility without a compromise., +    </para>, +    <para>, +      Some of you might already have found other network application, +      framework that claims to have the same advantage, and you might want, +      to ask what makes Netty so different from them.  The answer is the, +      philosophy where it is built on.  It's designed to give you the most, +      comfortable experience both in terms of the API and the implementation, +      from the day one.  It's not something tangible but you will get to, +      realize that this philosophy will make your life much easier as you, +      read this guide and play with Netty. , +    </para>, +  </section>, +++ b/src/docbook/master.xml, +  <xi:include href="module/state-mgmt.xml", +              xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" />, +              , +++ b/src/docbook/module/architecture.xml, +  <title>Architecture</title>, +++ b/src/docbook/module/preface.xml, +  <para>, +    The most fundamental question, <quote>What is Netty and why should I, +    care?</quote>, will be answered here., +  </para>, +  , +  <section>, +    <title>The Problem</title>, +    <para>, +      We are using a general purpose application or library to communicate, +      with each other nowadays.
