[+++ b/src/main/java/org/jboss/netty/channel/ChannelFuture.java, + * The result of an asynchronous {@link Channel} I/O operation., + * <p>, + * All I/O operations in Netty are asynchronous.  It means any I/O calls will, + * return immediately with no guarantee that the requested I/O operation has, + * been completed at the end of the call.  Instead, you will be returned with, + * a {@link ChannelFuture} instance which tells you when the requested I/O, + * operation has succeeded, failed, or canceled., + * <p>, + * Various methods are provided to let you check if the I/O operation has been, + * completed, wait for the completion, and retrieve the result of the I/O, + * operation. It also allows you to add more than one {@link ChannelFutureListener}, + * so you can get notified when the I/O operation has been completed.]
