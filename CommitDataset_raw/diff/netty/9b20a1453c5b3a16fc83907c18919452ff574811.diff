[+++ b/src/main/java/org/jboss/netty/channel/Channel.java, +import java.nio.channels.SelectionKey;, +import org.jboss.netty.channel.socket.nio.NioSocketChannelConfig;, + * <h3>InterestOps</h3>, + * <p>, + * A {@link Channel} has a property called {@link #getInterestOps() interestOps}, + * which is similar to that of {@link SelectionKey#interestOps()}.  It is, + * represented as an integer value which is composed of two flags by bitwise-OR, + * operation., + * <ul>, + * <li>{@link #OP_READ} - If set, a message sent by a remote peer will be read, + *     immediately.  If unset, the message from the remote peer will not be read, + *     until the {@link #OP_READ} flag is set again (i.e. read suspension).</li>, + * <li>{@link #OP_WRITE} - If set, a write request will not be sent to a remote, + *     peer until the {@link #OP_WRITE} flag is cleared and the write request, + *     will be pending in a queue.  If unset, the write request will be flushed, + *     out as soon as possible from the queue.</li>, + * <li>{@link #OP_READ_WRITE} - This is a combination of {@link #OP_READ} and, + *     {@link #OP_WRITE}, which means only write requests are suspended.</li>, + * <li>{@link #OP_NONE} - This is a combination of (NOT {@link #OP_READ}) and, + *     (NOT {@link #OP_WRITE}), which means only read operation is suspended.</li>, + * </ul>, + * </p><p>, + * You can set or clear the {@link #OP_READ} flag to suspend and resume read, + * operation via {@link #setReadable(boolean)}., + * </p><p>, + * Please note that you cannot suspend or resume write operation just like you, + * can set or clear {@link #OP_READ}. The {@link #OP_WRITE} flag is read only, + * and provided simply as a mean to tell you if the size of pending write, + * requests exceeded a certain threshold or not so that you don't issue too many, + * pending writes that lead to an {@link OutOfMemoryError}.  For example, the, + * NIO socket transport uses the {@code writeBufferLowWaterMark} and, + * {@code writeBufferHighWaterMark} properties in {@link NioSocketChannelConfig}, + * to determine when to set or clear the {@link #OP_WRITE} flag., + * </p>, + *, +     * The {@link #getInterestOps() interestOps} value which tells that only, +     * read operation has been suspended., +     * The {@link #getInterestOps() interestOps} value which tells that neither, +     * read nor write operation has been suspended., +     * The {@link #getInterestOps() interestOps} value which tells that both, +     * read and write operation has been suspended., +     * The {@link #getInterestOps() interestOps} value which tells that only, +     * write operation has been suspended.]
