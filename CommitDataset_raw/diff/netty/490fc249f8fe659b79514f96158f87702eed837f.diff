[+++ b/src/docbook/en-US/module/architecture.xml, +      A well-defined and extensible event model is a must for an event-driven, +      application.  Netty has a well-defined event model focused on I/O.  It, +      also allows you to implement your own event type without breaking the, +      existing code because each event type is distinguished from another by, +      a strict type hierarchy.  This is another differentiator against other, +      frameworks.  Many NIO frameworks have no or a very limited notion of an, +      event model. If they offer extension at all, they often break the, +      existing code when you try to add custom event types, +      you can define what to do when data is read from a socket:, +      You can also define what to do when a handler receives a write request:, +      For more information on the event model, please refer to the]
