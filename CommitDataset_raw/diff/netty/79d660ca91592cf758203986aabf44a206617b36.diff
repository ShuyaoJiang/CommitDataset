Some, +        that generates maintainable user codecs., +        Netty provides a number of basic and advanced codecs to address most, +        issues you will encounter when you write a protocol codec regardless, +        if it is simple or not, binary or text - simply whatever., +        as SSL itself.  You have to manage all possible states such as cipher, +        suite and encryption key negotiation (or re-negotiation), certificate, +        exchange, and validation.

It also, +        allows you to implement advanced features like, +        It gives you complete control over how HTTP messages are exchanged at a, +        low level.  Because it is basically the combination of an HTTP codec and, +        HTTP message classes, there is no restriction such as an enforced thread, +        exactly the way you want.  You have full control over everything that's, +        in the HTTP specification, including the thread model, connection life, +        cycle, and chunked encoding., +              until the whole media is streamed (e.g. 2 hours of video), +              File server that allows the uploading of large files without, +              memory pressure (e.g. uploading 1GB per request), +              Scalable mash-up client that connects to tens of thousands of 3rd, +        binary protocols that evolve over time.  With &ProtobufEncoder; and, +        &ProtobufDecoder;, you can turn the message classes generated by the, +        Google Protocol Buffers Compiler (protoc) into Netty codec.
