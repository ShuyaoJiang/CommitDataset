Primitive arrays, iterables and iterators of any kind of, + *     {@code Number}, and primitive varargs are supported., + * <li>Or, to avoid storing up all the data first, create a {@link StatsAccumulator} instance, feed, + *     values to it as you get them, then call {@link StatsAccumulator#snapshot}., + * </ul>, + *, + * <p>Static convenience methods called {@code meanOf} are also provided for users who wish to, + * calculate <i>only</i> the mean., + *, + * <p><b>Java 8 users:</b> If you are not using any of the variance statistics, you may wish to use, + * built-in JDK libraries instead of this class.]
