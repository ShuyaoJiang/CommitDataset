[+++ b/guava/src/com/google/common/hash/Funnel.java, + * <p>Note that serialization of {@linkplain BloomFilter bloom filters} requires the proper, + * serialization of funnels. When possible, it is recommended that funnels be implemented as a, + * single-element enum to maintain serialization guarantees. See Effective Java (2nd Edition),, + * Item 3: "Enforce the singleton property with a private constructor or an enum type". For example:, + * <pre>   {@code, + *   public enum PersonFunnel implements Funnel<Person> {, + *     INSTANCE;, + *     public void funnel(Person person, PrimitiveSink into) {, + *       into.putString(person.getFirstName()), + *           .putString(person.getLastName()), + *           .putInt(person.getAge());, + *     }, + *   }</pre>, + * , +   * @since 12.0 (in Guava 11.0, {@code PrimitiveSink} was named {@code Sink})]
