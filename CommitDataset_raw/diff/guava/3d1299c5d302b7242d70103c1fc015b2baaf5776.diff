[+++ b/guava/src/com/google/common/collect/MapMaker.java, + * <p>If {@link #weakKeys}, {@link #weakValues}, or {@link #softValues} are requested, it is, + * possible for a key or value present in the map to be reclaimed by the garbage collector. Entries, + * with reclaimed keys or values may be removed from the map on each map modification or on, + * occasional map accesses; such entries may be counted by {@link Map#size}, but will never be, + * visible to read or write operations. A partially-reclaimed entry is never exposed to the user., + * Any {@link java.util.Map.Entry} instance retrieved from the map's, + * {@linkplain Map#entrySet entry set} is a snapshot of that entry's state at the time of, + * retrieval; such entries do, however, support {@link java.util.Map.Entry#setValue}, which simply, + * calls {@link Map#put} on the entry's key.]
