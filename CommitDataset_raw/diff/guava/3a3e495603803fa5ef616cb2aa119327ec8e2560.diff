[+++ b/README.md, +2. APIs without `@Beta` will remain binary-compatible for the indefinite, +future. (Previously, we sometimes removed such APIs after a deprecation period., +The last release to remove non-`@Beta` APIs was Guava 21.0.) Even `@Deprecated`, +APIs will remain (again, unless they are `@Beta`). We have no plans to start, +removing things again, but officially, we're leaving our options open in case, +of surprises (like, say, a serious security problem).]
