[+++ b/guava/src/com/google/common/io/Closeables.java, +   * @deprecated This method has few valid use cases and encourages misuse by, +   *     making it easy to do the wrong thing. Among other things, it may, +   *     swallow exceptions that really should be thrown, such as exceptions, +   *     thrown when closing an output stream: this often involves flushing, +   *     buffered data to the final output destination and as such it is just, +   *     as important to throw the exception thrown when closing as it is to, +   *     throw an exception thrown by a call to a write method. This method, +   *     is scheduled to be removed in Guava 16.0., +  @Deprecated]
