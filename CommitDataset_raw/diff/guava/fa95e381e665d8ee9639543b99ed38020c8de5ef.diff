APIs marked with the `@Beta` annotation at the class or method level, +are subject to change. They can be modified in any way, or even, +removed, at any time. If your code is a library itself (i.e. it is, +used on the CLASSPATH of users outside your own control), you should, +not use beta APIs, unless you repackage them (e.g. using ProGuard)., +, +2. Deprecated non-beta APIs will be removed two years after the, +release in which they are first deprecated. You must fix your, +references before this time. If you don't, any manner of breakage, +could result (you are not guaranteed a compilation error)., +, +3. Serialized forms of ALL objects are subject to change unless noted, +otherwise. Do not persist these and assume they can be read by a, +future version of the library., +, +4. Our classes are not designed to protect against a malicious caller., +You should not use them for communication between trusted and, +untrusted code., +, +5. We unit-test and benchmark the libraries using only OpenJDK 1.7 on, +Linux. Some features, especially in `com.google.common.io`, may not work, +correctly in other environments.]
