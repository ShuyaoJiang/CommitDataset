[+++ b/guava/src/com/google/common/util/concurrent/ListenableFuture.java, + * <p><b>Test doubles</b>: If you need a {@code ListenableFuture} for your test, try a {@link, + * SettableFuture} or one of the methods in the {@link Futures#immediateFuture Futures.immediate*}, + * family. <b>Avoid</b> creating a mock or stub {@code Future}. Mock and stub implementations are, + * fragile because they assume that only certain methods will be called and because they often, + * implement subtleties of the API improperly., + *, + * <p><b>Custom implementation</b>: Avoid implementing {@code ListenableFuture} from scratch.
