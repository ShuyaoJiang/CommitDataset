[+++ b/README.md, +* Event methods define for themselves in which thread they get called. This is done by providing "modifiers" to the method name, e.g. onEventMainThread is called by the main thread without further configuration. Have a look at the JavaDoc of the enum ThreadMode for all available thread modes., +* New "BackgroundThread" modifier for onEvent handler methods ensures that event handler methods are called in a background thread. If an event is posted from a non-main thread, handler methods will be called directly. If posted from the main thread, EventBus will use a background thread to call the handler methods., +* New "Async" modifier for onEvent handler methods ensures that each event handler method is called completely asynchronously., +* Better performace: Delivery of multiple events in the main thread got significantly faster., +* Added sticky events, which are inspired by sticky broadcasts of the Android system. EventBus keeps the most recent sticky events in memory. Subscribers registering with the new method registerSticky, will receive sticky events right away. You can also query and remove sticky events (methods getStickyEvent and removeStickyEvent)., +* Bug fixes, +* Internal refactorings, moved inner classes of EventBus to separate files to keep the code more managable.]
