[+++ b/README.md, +*Example:* Consider your subscriber updates the UI, but the triggering event is posted by a background thread (using `eventBus.post(event)`). The name of the event handling method should be `onEventMainThread`. EventBus takes care of calling the method in the main thread without any further code required, +API-wise events are made sticky by using `postSticky(Object event)` instead of `post(Object event)`. Subscribers that want to get previously posted sticky events, use `registerSticky(...)` instead of `register(...)`. Alternatively, the last sticky event of a certain event type can be queried by using `getStickyEvent(Class<?> eventType)`.]
