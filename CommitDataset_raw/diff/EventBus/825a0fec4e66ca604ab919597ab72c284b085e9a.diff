[+++ b/README.md, +### V2.0.0 (2012-0X-XX), +* Event methods define for themselves in which thread they get called. This is done by providing "modifiers" to the method name, e.g. onEvent is still called in the same thread as it was posted, but onEventMainThread will be called by the main thread without further configuration., +* The event method modifiers replace registerForMainThread methods. Moving this information to the method itself should make things clearer., +* Using event method modifiers, subscribers can receive the same event type in different threads if they choose to., +* New "BackgroundThread" modifier for onEvent handler methods are called in a background thread. If an event is posted from a non-main thread, handler methods will be called directly. If posted from the main thread, EventBus will use a background thread to call the handler methods., +* Delivery of multiple events in the main thread got significantly faster., +* Fixed some event leakage., +]
