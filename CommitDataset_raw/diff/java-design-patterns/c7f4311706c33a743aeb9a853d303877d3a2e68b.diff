[+++ b/feature-toggle/src/main/java/com/iluwatar/featuretoggle/App.java, + * The Feature Toggle pattern allows for complete code executions to be turned on or off with ease. This allows features, + * to be controlled by either dynamic methods just as {@link User} information or by {@link Properties}. In the App, + * below there are two examples. Firstly the {@link Properties} version of the feature toggle, where the enhanced, + * version of the welcome message which is personalised is turned either on or off at instance creation. This method, + * is not as dynamic as the {@link User} driven version where the feature of the personalised welcome message is, + * dependant on the {@link UserGroup} the {@link User} is in. So if the user is a memeber of the, + * {@link UserGroup#isPaid(User)} then they get an ehanced version of the welcome message., + *, + * Note that this pattern can easily introduce code complexity, and if not kept in check can result in redundant, + * unmaintained code within the codebase., +   *  Block 1 shows the {@link PropertiesFeatureToggleVersion} being run with {@link Properties} setting the feature, +   *  toggle to enabled., +   *  Block 2 shows the {@link PropertiesFeatureToggleVersion} being run with {@link Properties} setting the feature, +   *  toggle to disabled. Notice the difference with the printed welcome message the username is not included., +   *, +   *  Block 3 shows the {@link com.iluwatar.featuretoggle.pattern.tieredversion.TieredFeatureToggleVersion} being, +   *  set up with two users on who is on the free level, while the other is on the paid level. When the, +   *  {@link Service#getWelcomeMessage(User)} is called with the paid {@link User} note that the welcome message, +   *  contains their username, while the same service call with the free tier user is more generic. No username is, +   *  printed., +   *, +   *  @see User, +   *  @see UserGroup, +   *  @see Service, +   *  @see PropertiesFeatureToggleVersion, +   *  @see com.iluwatar.featuretoggle.pattern.tieredversion.TieredFeatureToggleVersion;, +, +    // ---------------------------------------------, +, +    // --------------------------------------------, +]
