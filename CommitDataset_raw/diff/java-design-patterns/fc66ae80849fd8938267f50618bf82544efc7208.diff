[+++ b/mediator/src/main/java/com/iluwatar/mediator/App.java, + * The Mediator pattern defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects , + * interact. This pattern is considered to be a behavioral pattern due to the way , + * it can alter the program's running behavior., + * <p>, + * Usually a program is made up of a large number of classes. So the logic and , + * computation is distributed among these classes. However, as more classes are , + * developed in a program, especially during maintenance and/or refactoring, , + * the problem of communication between these classes may become more complex. , + * This makes the program harder to read and maintain. Furthermore, it can become , + * difficult to change the program, since any change may affect code in several , + * other classes., + * <p>, + * With the Mediator pattern, communication between objects is encapsulated with , + * a mediator object. Objects no longer communicate directly with each other, but , + * instead communicate through the mediator. This reduces the dependencies between , + * communicating objects, thereby lowering the coupling., + * <p>, + * In this example the mediator encapsulates how a set of objects ({@link PartyMember}) , + * interact. Instead of referring to each other directly they use the mediator , + * ({@link Party}) interface.]
