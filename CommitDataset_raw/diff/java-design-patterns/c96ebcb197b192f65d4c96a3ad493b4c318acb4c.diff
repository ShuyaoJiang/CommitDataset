[+++ b/data-bus/src/main/java/com/iluwatar/databus/App.java, + * <p>, + * <p>The Data-Bus pattern provides a method where different parts of an application may, + * pass messages between each other without needing to be aware of the other's existence.</p>, + * <p>Similar to the {@code ObserverPattern}, members register themselves with the {@link DataBus}, + * and may then receive each piece of data that is published to the Data-Bus. The member, + * may react to any given message or not.</p>, + * <p>It allows for Many-to-Many distribution of data, as there may be any number of, + * publishers to a Data-Bus, and any number of members receiving the data. All members, + * will receive the same data, the order each receives a given piece of data, is an, + * implementation detail.</p>, + * <p>Members may unsubscribe from the Data-Bus to stop receiving data.</p>]
