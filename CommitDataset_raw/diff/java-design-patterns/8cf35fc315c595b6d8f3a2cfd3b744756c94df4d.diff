[+++ b/decorator/src/main/java/com/iluwatar/decorator/App.java, + * The Decorator pattern is a more flexible alternative to subclassing. The Decorator, + * "decorate" calls to the target. Using the Decorator pattern it is possible to , + * change the behavior of the class during runtime., + * In this example we show how the simple {@link Troll} first attacks and then, + * flees the battle. Then we decorate the {@link Troll} with a {@link SmartTroll}, + * and perform the attack again. You can see how the behavior changes after the, + * decoration.]
