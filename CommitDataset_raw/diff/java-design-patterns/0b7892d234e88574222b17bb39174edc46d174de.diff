[+++ b/README.md, +![alt text](https://github.com/iluwatar/java-design-patterns/blob/master/flyweight/etc/flyweight.jpg "Flyweight"), +, +**Applicability:** The Flyweight pattern's effectiveness depends heavily on how and where it's used. Apply the Flyweight pattern when all of the following are true, +* an application uses a large number of objects, +* storage costs are high because of the sheer quantity of objects, +* most object state can be made extrinsic, +* many groups of objects may be replaced by relatively few shared objects once extrinsic state is removed, +* the application doesn't depend on object identity. Since flyweight objects may be shared, identity tests will return true for conceptually distinct objects., +]
