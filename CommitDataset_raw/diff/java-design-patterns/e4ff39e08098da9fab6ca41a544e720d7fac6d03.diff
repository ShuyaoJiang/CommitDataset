The Iterator pattern , + * decouples algorithms from containers., + * <p>, + * In this example the Iterator ({@link ItemIterator}) adds abstraction layer on , + * top of a collection ({@link TreasureChest}). This way the collection can change , + * its internal implementation without affecting its clients.]
