[+++ b/prototype/src/main/java/com/iluwatar/prototype/App.java, + * The Prototype pattern is a creational design pattern in software development. It is , + * used when the type of objects to create is determined by a prototypical instance, , + * which is cloned to produce new objects. This pattern is used to:, + * - avoid subclasses of an object creator in the client application, like the abstract factory pattern does., + * - avoid the inherent cost of creating a new object in the standard way (e.g., using the 'new' keyword), + * <p>, + * In this example we have a factory class ({@link HeroFactoryImpl}) producing objects by, + * cloning the existing ones. The factory's prototype objects are given as constructor parameters.]
