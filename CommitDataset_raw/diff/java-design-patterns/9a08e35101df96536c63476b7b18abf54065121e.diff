[+++ b/builder/src/main/java/com/iluwatar/builder/App.java, + * The intention of the Builder pattern is to find a solution to the telescoping , + * constructor anti-pattern. The telescoping constructor anti-pattern occurs when the , + * increase of object constructor parameter combination leads to an exponential list , + * of constructors. Instead of using numerous constructors, the builder pattern uses , + * another object, a builder, that receives each initialization parameter step by step , + * and then returns the resulting constructed object at once., + * <p>, + * The Builder pattern has another benefit. It can be used for objects that contain , + * flat data (html code, SQL query, X.509 certificate...), that is to say, data that , + * can't be easily edited. This type of data cannot be edited step by step and must , + * be edited at once. The best way to construct such an object is to use a builder , + * class., + * <p>, + * In this example we have the Builder pattern variation as described by Joshua Bloch in]
