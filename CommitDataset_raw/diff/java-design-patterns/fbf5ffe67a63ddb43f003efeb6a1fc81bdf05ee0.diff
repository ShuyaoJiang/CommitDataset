[+++ b/adapter/README.md, +## Explanation, +Real world example, +, +> Consider that you have some pictures in your memory card and you need to transfer them to your computer. In order to transfer them you need some kind of adapter that is compatible with your computer ports so that you can attach memory card to your computer. In this case card reader is an adapter., +> Another example would be the famous power adapter; a three legged plug can't be connected to a two pronged outlet, it needs to use a power adapter that makes it compatible with the two pronged outlet., +> Yet another example would be a translator translating words spoken by one person to another, +, +In plain words, +, +> Adapter pattern lets you wrap an otherwise incompatible object in an adapter to make it compatible with another class., +, +Wikipedia says, +, +> In software engineering, the adapter pattern is a software design pattern that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code., +, +**Programmatic Example**, +, +Consider a captain that can only use rowing boats and cannot sail at all., +, +First we have interfaces `RowingBoat` and `FishingBoat`, +, +```, +public interface RowingBoat {, +  void row();, +}, +, +public class FishingBoat {, +  private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(FishingBoat.class);, +  public void sail() {, +    LOGGER.info("The fishing boat is sailing");, +  }, +}, +```, +, +And captain expects an implementation of `RowingBoat` interface to be able to move, +, +```, +public class Captain implements RowingBoat {, +, +  private RowingBoat rowingBoat;, +, +  public Captain(RowingBoat rowingBoat) {, +    this.rowingBoat = rowingBoat;, +  }, +, +  @Override, +  public void row() {, +    rowingBoat.row();, +  }, +}, +```, +, +Now let's say the pirates are coming and our captain needs to escape but there is only fishing boat available. We need to create an adapter that allows the captain to operate the fishing boat with his rowing boat skills., +, +```, +public class FishingBoatAdapter implements RowingBoat {, +, +  private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(FishingBoatAdapter.class);, +, +  private FishingBoat boat;, +, +  public FishingBoatAdapter() {, +    boat = new FishingBoat();, +  }, +, +  @Override, +  public void row() {, +    boat.sail();, +  }, +}, +```, +, +And now the `Captain` can use the `FishingBoat` to escape the pirates., +, +```, +Captain captain = new Captain(new FishingBoatAdapter());, +captain.row();, +```, +* most of the applications using third party libraries use adapters as a middle layer between the application and the 3rd party library to decouple the application from the library. If another library has to be used only an adapter for the new library is required without having to change the application code., +++ b/adapter/README.md, +## Explanation, +Real world example, +, +> Consider that you have some pictures in your memory card and you need to transfer them to your computer.
