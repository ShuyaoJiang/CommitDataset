This is accomplished, + * by separating the application's logic(Model), GUIs(View), and finally , + * the way that the user's actions update the application's logic(Presenter)., + * , + * In the following example, The FileLoader class represents the app's logic,, + * the FileSelectorJFrame is the GUI and the FileSelectorPresenter is, + * responsible to respond to users' actions., + * , + * Finally, please notice the wiring between the Presenter and the View, + * and between the Presenter and the Model., + * , + */]
