[+++ b/faq.md, +, +### Q8: What is the difference between java.io.Serialization and Memento pattern? {#Q8}, +, +Memento is typically used to implement rollback/save-point support. Example we might want to mark the state of an object at a point in time, do some work and then decide to rollback to the previous state. , +, +On the other hand serialization may be used as a tool to save the state of an object into byte[] and preserving the contents in memory or disk. When someone invokes the memento to revert object's previous state then we can deserialize the information stored and recreate previous state. , +, +So Memento is a pattern and serialization is a tool that can be used to implement this pattern. Other ways to implement the pattern can be to clone the contents of the object and keep track of those clones.]
