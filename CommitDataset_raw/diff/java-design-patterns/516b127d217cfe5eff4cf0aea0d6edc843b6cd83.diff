[+++ b/facade/src/main/java/com/iluwatar/facade/App.java, + * The Facade design pattern is often used when a system is very complex or difficult , + * to understand because the system has a large number of interdependent classes or , + * its source code is unavailable. This pattern hides the complexities of the larger , + * system and provides a simpler interface to the client. It typically involves a single , + * wrapper class which contains a set of members required by client. These members access , + * the system on behalf of the facade client and hide the implementation details., + * In this example the Facade is ({@link DwarvenGoldmineFacade}) and it provides a simpler , + * interface to the goldmine subsystem.]
