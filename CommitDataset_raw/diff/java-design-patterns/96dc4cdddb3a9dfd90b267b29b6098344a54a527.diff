Message Channels are logical addresses in the messaging system., + * <p>, + * The sending application doesn't necessarily know what particular application, + * will end up retrieving it, but it can be assured that the application that, + * retrieves the information is interested in that information. This is because, + * the messaging system has different Message Channels for different types of, + * information the applications want to communicate. When an application sends, + * information, it doesn't randomly add the information to any channel available;, + * it adds it to a channel whose specific purpose is to communicate that sort of, + * information. Likewise, an application that wants to receive particular information, + * doesn't pull info off some random channel; it selects what channel to get information, + * from based on what type of information it wants., + * <p>, + * In this example we use Apache Camel to establish a direct synchronous Message Channel , + * that delivers messages to console output. No actual messages are sent, only the established , + * routes are printed to standard output., + * , + */, +	/**, +	 * Program entry point, +	 * @param args command line args, +	 * @throws Exception, +	 */]
