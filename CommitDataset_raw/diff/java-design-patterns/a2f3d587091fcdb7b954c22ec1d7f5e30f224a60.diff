[+++ b/chain/src/main/java/com/iluwatar/chain/App.java, + * The Chain of Responsibility pattern is a design pattern consisting of command , + * objects and a series of processing objects. Each processing object contains , + * logic that defines the types of command objects that it can handle; the rest are , + * passed to the next processing object in the chain. A mechanism also exists for , + * adding new processing objects to the end of this chain., + * <p>, + * In this example we organize the request handlers ({@link RequestHandler}) into a, + * chain where each handler has a chance to act on the request on its turn. Here, + * the king ({@link OrcKing}) makes requests and the military orcs ({@link OrcCommander}, , + * {@link OrcOfficer}, {@link OrcSoldier}) form the handler chain.]
