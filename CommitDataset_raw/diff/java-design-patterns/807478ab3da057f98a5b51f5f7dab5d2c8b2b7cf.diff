[+++ b/composite/src/main/java/com/iluwatar/composite/App.java, + * The Composite pattern is a partitioning design pattern. The Composite pattern , + * describes that a group of objects is to be treated in the same way as a single , + * instance of an object. The intent of a composite is to "compose" objects into , + * tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Implementing the Composite , + * pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly., + * <p>, + * In this example we have sentences composed of words composed of letters. All of, + * the objects can be treated through the same interface ({@link LetterComposite}).]
