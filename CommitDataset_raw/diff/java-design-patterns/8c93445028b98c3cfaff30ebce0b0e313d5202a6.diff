[+++ b/README.md, +![alt text](https://github.com/iluwatar/java-design-patterns/blob/master/prototype/etc/prototype.jpg "Prototype"), +, +**Applicability:** Use the Prototype pattern when a system should be independent of how its products are created, composed and represented; and, +* when the classes to instantiate are specified at run-time, for example, by dynamic loading; or, +* to avoid building a class hierarchy of factories that parallels the class hierarchy of products; or, +* when instances of a class can have one of only a few different combinations of state. It may be more convenient to install a corresponding number of prototypes and clone them rather than instantiating the class manually, each time with the appropriate state, +]
