[+++ b/README.md, +* [Async Method Invocation](#async-method-invocation), +## <a name="async-method-invocation">Async Method Invocation</a> [&#8593;](#list-of-design-patterns), +**Intent:** Asynchronous method invocation is pattern where the calling thread is not blocked while waiting results of tasks. The pattern provides parallel processing of multiple independent tasks and retrieving the results via callbacks or waiting until everything is done. , +, +**Applicability:** Use async method invocation pattern when, +* You have multiple independent tasks that can run in parallel, +* You need to improve performance of running a group of sequential tasks, +* You have limited number of processing capacity or long running tasks and the caller cannot wait the tasks to be ready, +, +**Real world examples:**, +* [FutureTask](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/FutureTask.html), [CompletableFuture](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html) and [ExecutorService](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ExecutorService.html) (Java), +* [Task-based Asynchronous Pattern](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh873175.aspx) (.NET), +]
