[+++ b/README.md, +Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects., +* when extension by subclassing is impractical. Sometimes a large number of independent extensions are possible and would produce an explosion of subclasses to support every combination. Or a class definition may be hidden or otherwise unavailable for subclassing, +**Applicability:** The service locator pattern is applicable whenever we want to locate/fetch various services using JNDI which, typically, is a redundant and expensive lookup. The service Locator pattern addresses this expensive lookup by making use of caching techniques ie. for the very first time a particular service is requested, the service Locator looks up in JNDI, fetched the relevant service and then finally caches this service object. Now, further lookups of the same service via Service Locator is done in its cache which improves the performance of application to great extent., +* make web server configuration portable, you only need to register the handler web server specific way, +* you want loose coupling between presentation and business tiers]
