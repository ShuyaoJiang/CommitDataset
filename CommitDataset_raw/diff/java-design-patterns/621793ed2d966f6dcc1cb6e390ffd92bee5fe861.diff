[+++ b/dao/src/main/java/com/iluwatar/dao/App.java, + * Data Access Object (DAO) is an object that provides an abstract interface to some type of database or other , + * persistence mechanism. By mapping application calls to the persistence layer, DAO provide some specific data , + * operations without exposing details of the database. This isolation supports the Single responsibility principle. , + * It separates what data accesses the application needs, in terms of domain-specific objects and data types , + * (the public interface of the DAO), from how these needs can be satisfied with a specific DBMS., + * <p>, + * interacting with the data. The below example demonstrates basic CRUD operations: select, add, update, and delete.]
