[+++ b/promise/src/main/java/com/iluwatar/promise/Promise.java, + * A Promise represents a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It, + * allows you to associate dependent promises to an asynchronous action's eventual success value or, + * failure reason. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead , + * of the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise of having a value at some point , + * in the future.]
