[+++ b/hexagonal/src/main/java/com/iluwatar/hexagonal/App.java, + * Hexagonal Architecture pattern decouples the application core from the, + * services it uses. This allows the services to be plugged in and the , + * application will run with or without the services.<p>, + * , + * The core logic, or business logic, of an application consists of the , + * algorithms that are essential to its purpose. They implement the use , + * cases that are the heart of the application. When you change them, you , + * change the essence of the application.<p>, + * , + * The services are not essential. They can be replaced without changing , + * the purpose of the application. Examples: database access and other , + * types of storage, user interface components, e-mail and other , + * communication components, hardware devices.<p>, + * , + * This example demonstrates Hexagonal Architecture with a lottery system., + * The application core is separate from the services that drive it and, + * from the services it uses.<p>, + * , + * The primary ports for the application are {@link LotteryAdministration} , + * through which the lottery round is initiated and run and , + * {@link LotteryService} that allows players to submit lottery tickets for , + * the draw.<p>, + * , + * The secondary ports that application core uses are {@link WireTransfers}, + * which is a banking service, {@link LotteryNotifications} that delivers, + * notifications as lottery events occur and {@link LotteryTicketRepository}, + * that is the storage for the lottery tickets.]
