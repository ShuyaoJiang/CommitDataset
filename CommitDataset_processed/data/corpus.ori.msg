Simplify the implementation of RemovalNotification by extending AbstractMap.SimpleImmutableEntry.
Overhaul Android {Hash,LinkedHash}Multiset to operate much more directly on ObjectCountHashMap, eliminating many unnecessary classes, allocations, and even calls to hashCode on the elements.
Delete the NodeConnections interface. As an implementation detail we previously took advantage of the shared interface, but that is no longer the case, and such a trivial interface doesn't seem worth keeping around.
Stop stripping @LazyInit annotations.
Add RandomAccess implementations for Lists.{equals,indexOf,lastIndexOf}Impl, to eliminate allocation of the iterator.
Roll back most of the rest of CL 100047098 (the javatests/... parts, since I got java/... in 100850485).
Add some toString tests for CharMatcher.anyOf().
GWTifies Futures#transform().
Internal GWT change
Change AbstractListeningExecutorService to extend AbstractExecutorService.

Make MultisetNavigationTester.totalSize static.
Add c.g.common.base.Optional#transform(Function)

exclude base.internal from javadoc
Changed ClassSanityTester to not to attempt to instantiate the class if no instance method needs to be tested for nulls. This avoids unnecessary test failures for classes that don't need null check after all.
Remove duplicate Stopwatch tests.
Fix modifier order
Internally, use PatternCompiler from Doubles.tryParse.
Use getBytes(Charset) instead of getBytes(String) now that we require a new enough version of GWT.

Correct code example in Funnel Javadoc, that uses the old deprecated-then-removed PrimitiveSink#putString(String) method.
Ensure the correct removal notification is published.
Use GcFinalization.
Warn Android users that default Stopwatch behavior may be bad for their health.
common.graph PackageSanityTests: specify a default object for EndpointPair inputs.
Update example code snippet slightly (existing one doesn't techincally compile).
Graduate Verify and VerifyException from Beta as requested here:
massive manual sync
externally remove methods scheduled for deletion in release 11.0

Migrate tests for Multimap.keySet() from AbstractMultimapTest to MultimapTestSuiteBuilder.
Applied package sanity tests to common/base

Fix nonpublic identifiers and documentation that use "whitelist" or "blacklist" to use less problematic terms.
Bring over some API documentation from []
Update Public Suffix data.
Rollback of changelist 64659484 ("Make common.reflect build and pass tests against both Java 7 and Java 8").

Change ByteStreams.asByteSource calls to ByteSource.wrap and deprecate it.
Update hasPublicSuffix javadoc
Remove some methods that are scheduled for removal in 23.0, along with one that was apparently scheduled for removal in 21.0.
Add the methods Graphs.reachableNodes() and Graphs.transitiveClosure(). Three teams have already implemented similar logic! Also, looking through the remaining uses of the legacy Digraph, the only thing preventing many from being converted to common.graph is the lack of transitive closure. So I'd say there's very high demand for this.
Remove specification of behavior when the number of arguments does not match the number of "%s" in the format string from Preconditions javadoc.
Stop recommending the use of delimiters when hashing strings.
Fix ByteArrayByteSource.slice to handle the case where offset + length > Long.MAX_VALUE.

Document that the memory increases appear to be necessary for Travis only (and that they do appear to solve the problem there).
updated POMs for maven builds.
Update misleading comment in RegularImmutableList; it is used even for lists
Better documentation for an Android test suppression.
Update Public Suffix List.
Add missing @Nullable annotation to ForwardingSortedSet.unsafeCompare(Object, Object).
Document compare() methods to point out their JDK equivalents.
Deprecate mutator methods on immutable/unmodifiable classes in common.collect.  It can't possibly be correct to invoke a method that mutates a collection on an immutable object and this will help catch those errors at compile time.  It also has the benefit that IDEs set up to filter deprecated methods from the auto-complete suggestions will filter out the unsupported methods.
Migrate calls of to-be-deprecated Futures.get to equivalent Futures.getChecked.
Automated rollback of dfc51048f549.
FluentFuture.
Rewrite ImmutableSortedMultiset.Builder on Android to avoid using TreeMultiset, which allocates a ton of objects and also uses a ton of code.

Convert all @GwtIncompatible.reason values to implementation comments.
This change replaces usages of static final fields on CharMatcher, e.g. CharMatcher.WHITESPACE, with the equivalent static factory method, e.g. CharMatcher.whitespace().
Add toJavaUtil instance method, which is handier and also doesn't have to be
Rewrite ImmutableMultiset on Java 7 in terms of the guts of HashMultiset, taking ruthless advantage of its property that it retains insertion order in the absence of removals.
Speed up notably slow math tests for GWT's sake.
Add reference to Funnels from Funnel javadocs.
Shuffling from internal-only change.
Add an example to the javadocs for ThreadFactoryBuilder#setNameFormat
Revert hack introduced in []
Restore LocalCache.LocalManualCache.{apply,get,getUnchecked} to fix Guava compilation.
Move many implementations out of Futures.java (https://github.com/google/guava/issues/2091).

Change @since on some methods in reflect.Parameter to 18.0 since the changes didn't make it in to 17.0.
Add one or two missing tests.
Add @CheckReturnValue to the com.google.common.io package. This forces the caller of these APIs to "do something" with the result of the call.
Add nullness annotations on the fields in CompactLinkedHashSet.java
Rename ConfigurableNetwork->ConfigurableMutableNetwork and ConfigurableGraph->ConfigurableMutableGraph. A followup CL will rename AbstractConfigurableNetwork->ConfigurableNetwork and AbstractConfigurableGraph->ConfigurableGraph (this is being done in two seperate CLs otherwise critique doesn't understand it's a rename). The above mentioned classes are not actually abstract, so calling them Abstract* is wrong.
Remove Platform.clone(), along with various supersource versions.
Open source lots of Caliper benchmarks!
Added test for addAllImpl.
Add some missing @Nullable annotations.

Move <p> tags to the beginning of the line.
Annotate com.google.common.base.Converter reverse field with @LazyInit.
Removed {Successor,Predecessor}Graph.nodes().
Make the tests for Quantiles use up-to-date Truth technology. My main motiviation here is to stop using hasValuesWithin, which is going away. While I'm at it, let's start using comparingValuesUsing for the Map assertions to avoid the unpleasant loop, and inline the helpers, which aren't really useful now that we've done that.
Use Collections.newSetFromMap directly.
Fix DoubleMath rounding bug identified in Guava issue 2509.
Add more validation to AbstractFuture when cancellation causes are enabled, so that it matches the behavior when they are disabled.
Applied missing Apache license stuff to the files I forgot in previous round (oops)
Super source Strings#isNullOrEmpty to improve JS performance.
Use AssertionError for default case.
Make a slight tweak to the way we calculate means in StatsAccumulator. We pull out a variable for (value - mean) instead of computing it twice. This also means that we no longer need the old mean to compute the change in sumOfSquaresOfDeltas, we only need the new mean, so we can update mean directly instead of storing nextMean. We end up with the same number of temporary variables and the same calculation but one subtraction fewer and (perhaps more importantly) we do the computations in a more natural order.

refactor literal to named constant
Mark the two deprecated digesting methods as @GoogleInternal.
Guava issue 1001: stop reimplementing Sets.newSetFromMap, now that the backport is in place.
Loosen the tests around the regex: It's OK for the regex to match something that turns out to be invalid.
Added a test for copyOf when the collection is an EnumSet.  In the process generalized the abstract classes so that we could call copy of.
Remove unnecessary method type parameter.
Add @SafeVarargs to Predicates.and(Predicate<? super T>...).
Migrate users from c.g.c.base.Objects to MoreObjects.

Instead of suppressing iterator().remove() tests, make iterator.remove() support an independent property of a collection implementation.
Propagate close for to the inputs of Streams.zip and Streams.mapWithIndex
Stop scrubbing some more usernames (MOE update?).
Put scary doc on hashString and less scary doc on hashUnencodedChars.

Convert much of Guava to Truth by using Refaster.
Support for empty ArrayTable.
Fix javadoc typo: wrapTask
Add @CheckReturnValue to BinaryPredicates and Defaults.
Delete AndroidInteger.
Migrate the remaining Multimap.values() tests from AbstractMultimap to MultimapTestSuiteBuilder, and delete AbstractMultimapTest, which no longer contains any tests.
Add the TestSuiteBuilder for Multimap.values(), and fix Multimaps.filterXXX to pass those tests properly.
Implement Maps.asMap(Set, Function) view.
Introduce AbstractGraph. This is a bare-bones base class that all Graph implementations should be able to extend (analogous to e.g. AbstractSet for Sets). It ensures there is consistent equals()/hashCode() across different Graph implementations. Additionally, this CL drops the requirement that two graphs have to have "the same type" to be equal.
Add and use helper methods like assertDone() in tests.
Whitespace changes from MOE release?
Replace constants (static final CONSTANT_CASE) declaration type which use the general collection interface (e.g. List) with an immutable type (e.g. ImmutableList).

Automated g4 rollback of changelist 113559037.
Methods that take an edge as parameter now take type E instead of Object.
Remove an unneeded dependency.
remove maven parallel tree for sub-artifacts... they won't break down this way necessarily, and guava is small enough to be a single dependency.  we'll just ship monolithic, per the mailing list conversation.
Fix LongMath.checkedPow to correctly error out on large negative inputs, and fix LongMathTest to test a full range of long inputs.  See https://github.com/google/guava/issues/2036 .

3 days of pent-up improvements:
Replace constants (static final CONSTANT_CASE) declaration type which use the general collection interface (e.g. List) with an immutable type (e.g. ImmutableList).
Update poms to support properly generated OSGI metadata and signing with GPG
Change failureaccess packaging to bundle so the OSGi metadata actually gets included.
Replace instances of StringBuilder.append(String.substring/CharSequence.subsequence) with the append overload that takes a substring range. Plus another minor change.
Migrate Multiset.remove() tests from AbstractMultisetTest to MultisetRemoveTester, split off from MultisetWritesTester, as part of the MultisetTestSuiteBuilder.

Add testConstructors(), testStaticMethods(), testInstanceMethods() that take a
ValueGraph.java: remove bogus @since 23.0 on edgeValueOrDefault.
Remove "SetView" from all graph implementations. See [] for why it should be killed with fire. In particular, it made the returned Sets have O(N) (in both time and memory) size() and contains() methods, and in one case, O(N^2) iteration!
Move implementations from Objects methods into MoreObjects.
Allow HashCode#padToLong to work with hashs that have <32 bits.
Remove the array copy from Fingerprint2011.hashBytes(byte[], int, int) method.

add escapers back to Guava
Javadoc improvement(?) pass to Function/Functions. To be continued.
Fixes incorrectly-ordered arguments to calls to assertEquals
Among the Futures methods that run user callbacks, those that don't take an Executor will be deleted.  This CL migrates them to the counterparts that take MoreExecutors.directExecutor() as such Executor in the parameter list, exactly the way that the old method works.
Add missing modules.
Shuffling from internal-only change.

Update references to guava-libraries.googlecode.com to the Github location in pom.xml files.
Fix typo
Fix a race:

More reformatting.
Rewrite Multimaps.filter implementations, factoring out a significantly more efficient Multimaps.filterKeys implementation in the process.

Make common.reflect build and pass tests against both Java 7 and Java 8.
Warn a little more about weakKeys resulting in == key comparisons, even in the asMap view.
Change name of Animal Sniffer run.
On second thought, back out a few diamond operators in the mainline when they don't also work with Java 7 type inference.
grow the destination buffer more aggressively to avoid excessive array copying in escapeSlow
Fix two bugs in MinMaxPriorityQueue (introduced in [] First is a bug in removeAt(int) that sometimes causes the wrong element to be removed. Second is a bug that sometimes causes certain elements to be iterated over more than once if elements were removed during iteration.
Introduce Futures.transform overloads that accept an AsyncFunction in preparation for eliminating Futures.chain.
Replace evictionQueue and expirationQueue with accessQueue and writeQueue.
Delete MapMaker.expireAfterAccess(), including it's recencyQueue.

Add missing @since NEXTs.
Enhance toString() for futures returned from ExecutionSequencer.
This CL fixes method calls that incorrectly ignore the return

Assorted cleanup:
Optimize BaseEncoding by removing GwtWorkarounds and using an implementation without streams
Move GraphProperties.isCyclic() to Graphs, delete the GraphProperties class. Rename method to hasCycle(), because isCyclic() implies that it might be O(1). Also to be consistent if we ever add other "has" methods (e.g. hasSelfLoop(), hasTriangleSubgraph(), etc.).
Eliminate most holder classes from c.g.c.hash.Hashing, but still keep those constants lazily generated -- e.g. moving the static constant to its own implementation class.
Add toString() to some Future subclasses.
Remove unused imports.
Split SortedMap tests out of NavigableMap tests in preparation for running the former under GWT.

GWT-related shuffling from internal change.
Another flaky test.

Add publicApiOnly (shuffling resulting from internal-only change).
In com.google.common.reflect.Types, make the Method objects that are used as part of Java compatibility accessible.

Fix BaseEncodingTest#testBase16UpperCaseIsNoOp to actually test what it's meant to test.
Remove reference to UTF_16LE equivalence.
Move Byte/CharStreams.concat into Byte/CharSource.
Flatten the Graph->Network hierarchy. In other words, it's no longer true that a Network IS A Graph. Instead, provide an asGraph() method that allows for viewing a Network as a Graph. Also, update a lot of code that should have been using Graph (instead of Network) to use Graph.
Change version number in pom files from 24.0 to HEAD(-jre/android-SNAPSHOT).

Fix LocalCache.asMap().values() to not implement Set.
Among the Futures methods that run user callbacks, those that don't take an Executor will be deleted.  This CL migrates them to the counterparts that take MoreExecutors.directExecutor() as such Executor in the parameter list, exactly the way that the old method works.
Rewrite TreeRangeSet.complement() to be implemented in the same way as TreeRangeSet itself -- as a NavigableMap<Cut<C>, Range<C>> mapping lower bounds to ranges.
Override HashFunction#toString() where possible.
Add even more toString details to Futures.
Update Guava to use Truth 0.41.
Clarify some docs on Ordering+Comparators
Issue 972: Ordering.allEqual().
Update isCyclic() to work on both directed and undirected graphs. This is part of the effort to move it to Graphs (which I'll do in a followup CL), so we can delete the GraphProperties class!

Rewrite TreeRangeSet implementation to use its own, smarter complement implementation.  Most notably, complement().encloses(Range) is now a logarithmic-time operation.
Getting jdiff working more completely, so that a report can always be viewed of
take core cache classes out of Beta
Suppress tests under Android.
I was reading through the class-level javadoc (which could use some cleaning up, but I think jrtom said he's working on that), and this passage struck me. The latter two options don't seem like something that would actually happen. For example, we allow nodes of any type, so an impl where the nodes store the topology and cannot be shared across graphs doesn't really make sense.
Guava issue 1049: minor optimizations for CharMatcher
Enable command-line filtering of tests with, e.g., -Dtest.include=**/ClassPathTest.java

Added testEquals() to AbstractPackageSanityTests.
Add BaseEncoding.canDecode(CharSequence).

Add @CheckReturnValue to c.g.c.hash APIs
Improve performance of nested calls to Iterables.concat() and Iterators.concat() *without* using any additional memory. This CL brings the runtime from O(D^3) to O(D^2), where D is the nesting depth of concatenation.

Improve some javadoc in Preconditions.
Remove c.g.c.base.Stopwatch#toString(int).
Deprecate InputSupplier, OutputSupplier and all public methods in common.io that use either type. Also release methods on Byte/CharSource that take ByteProcessor and LineProcessor so that the equivalent methods in Byte/CharStreams can be deprecated reasonably.
Remove a redundant RegularImmutableSortedSet workaround for comparators that are inconsistent with equals().
Add Longs.tryParse.
Add static factory methods to CharMatcher equivalent to the existing constants.
manual sync
- add cache cleanup

Fix for Android crash caused by mis-aligned call of Unsafe.getLong on a 4-byte aligned field offset.
Clean up usages of deprecated Truth has() Collection methods:
Update edgesConnecting().size() and edgesConnecting().isEmpty() to be more efficient for Networks with parallel edges. In particular, take advantage of the cached successor multisets. Currently the methods are always O(D). This will also be O(D) if successors hasn't been invoked, but will be O(1) for future calls. For example, with something like:
Remove deprecated appendTo(Object&Iterable&Iterator) overloads.
Add a value-merging collector for ImmutableTable.
Making Queues#drain calls timeouts more accurate, by potentially adding a System.nanoTime() call.
Fixed signature compatibility issue.
Added min, max, lexicographicalComparator tests

A few small cleanups to Reflection.
Fix typos in UnsignedInts docs
Add @GoogleInternal propagateCancellation to Futures.
Use string substitution for MapMaker checkNotNull.
Add ByteSteams.exhaust(InputStream) and CharStreams.exhaust(Readable).

(I've preserved two existing exceptions: compose(b, a) (which returns "b(a)") and forMap(map, default) (which returns "Functions.forMap(map, defaultValue=default)"). I don't know whether that's ideal, but it doesn't feel worth spending too much time worrying about.)
More tests for ObjectArrays.
Add tests that the custom hash table implementations expand correctly.
Import publicsuffix.org's test data.
Reduce iterations of testBuilder_bruteForce under GWT.

Remove the jsr-330 annotations from ServiceManager and remove javax.inject from
add osgi metadata

For constant field declarations, you should use the immutable type (such as ImmutableList) instead of the general collection interface type (such as List). This communicates to your callers important semantic guarantees.
Delete the unused, @GoogleInternal copy* methods (in particular, copyNodes, copyEdges, and their Predicate-based counterparts). We're missing the ValueGraph version for all of these, and in the copyEdges case, also the Graph version. The Predicate-based methods have the obvious issue that we'd want to release with the Java-8 Predicate, not the Guava Predicate. copyNodes() and copyEdges() have the unfortunate issue of there not being an obvious correct answer for the whether the source or destination should come first in the parameters. And finally, copyEdges() requires us to decide what to do in the event that the destination graph doe not contain the incident nodes (and neither option is particularly intuitive). Overall, we'd rather not have to support these methods at this point.
Update Public Suffix data.

Write tests to verify that HashFunction shortcuts are equivalent to the long forms.  Then fix the legacy hashing implementations to unbreak them.
Simplify ImmutableSortedMap, reducing memory consumption and simplifying code.
Optimize Ascii toUpperCase/toLowerCase for generic charsequences

Applied package sanity tests to common.eventbus

Fixing bug in NullPointerTester, where it fails spuriously for methods with no default value for @Nullable parameters.
Partial rollback of changelist 150805495.
Make some methods in guava-tests static.
Inline BaseHolder interface into Holder and Optional. It was causing issues to	Scala users and didn't really serve any purpose anyway. This also makes it	easier to start selectively eliminating some of the methods from Holder if we	want to do that.

Make smear() produce accurate results under GWT, hopefully.
More reformatting.
Make MapTestSuiteBuilder (also BiMapTestSuiteBuilder) work under GWT, and then use it there (as well as the non-GWT ImmutableSortedMapTest, where it should have been used already).
Fix bug in statistics benchmarks implementation of Knuth algorithms.

Add c.g.c.net.MediaType#TIFF

ValueGraph implementation.
Switch BiMap tests all the way over to BiMapTestSuiteBuilder.
Redesign of MapMakerInternalMap with the motivation of saving a lot of memory by not wastefully having stuff that's unneeded. The algorithm (the j.u.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap-inspired segments of hash tables) is untouched.

Add a test to demonstrate that hashBytes(Ints.toByteArray(i)) ==
Add SuppressWarnings for a couple places where a return value that shouldn't normally be ignored is ignored.
Migrate off of deprecated Truth methods (created using Refaster)
Make WrappingScheduledExecutorService's constructor protected, rather than package-private. (This is consistent with WrappingExecutorService.)
Clean up misuses of Truth where proposition values are passed into ASSERT.that() instead of the object under test.  This leads to patterns like:
Apply a handful of automated "returns @Nullable" suggestions.

Add ValueGraph.edgeValues(). Remove ValueGraph.edgeValueOrDefault(node, node).
Add tests for Lists.lastIndexOfImpl (Also removed one warning from ListsTest).
Complete the migration of static analysis annotations to Error Prone

Adds a small clarifying comment to the Javadoc of common.cache.RemovalListener.
Add some test coverage for removeEdge().
Defer overlap checking in ImmutableRange{Set,Map}.Builder to the build() call, which matches the behavior in ImmutableMap.Builder and allows significantly faster handling of the case where ranges are inserted in predictable order.

Prepare for release 26.0.
Roll-forward addition of ExecutionSequencer.
Shuffling from internal-only change.
Guava issue 1012: Sets.filter for NavigableSet
A few small cleanups to the murmur3 hash functions.

Delete the TODO to "try creating an abstract superclass that NetworkBuilder and GraphBuilder could derive from."
Give removal dates (releases) for HashFunction#hashString(CS) and
- More carefully guard all of loadFuture's functionality inside the try block

Fix a URL.
Avoid using inotify, which is causing problem under JDK10.
Copy static factory methods from HashCodes to HashCode.
Update Public Suffix List.
Add createConstant and createConstantUtf8 static methods. This avoids a lot of the weird initiaization ordering issues and allows us to consistently use create everywhere instead of having to rely on the constructor in some places.
Some minor improvements to FeatureUtil in the hope of speeding up c.g.c.collect tests.
Remove wildcard imports.
Move @CheckReturnValue to package-info.java so it applies to all of
Refactor AbstractMultimap into a separate AbstractMultimap and AbstractMapBasedMultimap.
Have Cache.stats() warn that stats might be untracked (zero). Addresses Guava
Add @Nullable annotations to computing map/cache implementations to satisfy Findbugs.
I remember why I did the parallel edge check before the self-loop check now! In the MutableGraph case, it's actually more efficient, because we can return early (rather than just throw an exception) in that case. And I have the same order in MutableNetwork just for consistency.
Fix particularly unfortunate typo in ValueGraph javadoc.
Don't require an exception to be thrown on a no-op putIfAbsent if put is unsupported.
Do not require an exception to be thrown on a no-op putIfAbsent if null is unsupported.

Add ImmutableBiMap.Builder.put(Entry) overload, which had previously not been overridden from ImmutableMap.Builder.  Now, it correctly returns ImmutableBiMap.Builder.
Test ImmutableIntArray under GWT.
Quiesce the continuous integration builds a bit by running maven in batch mode (reducing chatter from download progress logging)
Open source com.google.common.graph into Guava.
Rename CleanPathTest to FilesSimplifyPathTest.
Remove more unnecessary @CheckReturnValues on APIs now that these packages are
Added SuccessorGraph/PredecessorGraph.
Automated (partial) g4 rollback of changelist 100047098.

Add Annotations to a gwt.xml file.
Automated g4 rollback of changelist 97776570.

Group annotation dependencies at the top.
Added min, max, lexicographical comparator tests to primitives.UnsignedInts
Add @NullableDecl on the field in TopKSelector.java
Remove @CanIgnoreReturnValue from c.g.c.base.Ticker
Add the method Graphs.endpoints() that does what you expect: returns the endpoints corresponding to each edge in a graph. The whole "we print every edge in an undirected graph's toString() twice, and that's a feature not a bug *wink*" annoyed me. Also there's other cases, such as copyOf() and and getWeaklyConnectedComponents(), where we don't want to process each edge twice. In those particular cases they happen to be no-ops, but for cases where it's not, or where you do something computationally expensive, doubling up on undirected edges is bad :(
Remove the isDirected() method from Endpoints. Also remove Graphs.addEdge(), which was only used inside Graphs, and I wasn't a huge fan of (it's super easy to implement yourself if you need the functionality).
Deprecate GenericMapMaker.
Noninvasive patch for negative results from size().  See https://github.com/google/guava/issues/2108 for more details.
Louis's changes to remove JDK6-isms from DoubleMath

add Cache.get(K, Callable<V>)
Implement ImmutableRangeMap.subRangeMap(Range)
Add more consistency checks to AbstractGraphTest.
Pass a Locale to String.format calls.
Delete DiscreteDomains for Guava 15.
Stop using now-internally-deprecated Truth APIs (which are not yet pushed to open-source Truth), and leave a todo to migrate to the newer Truth apis once they are released to maven, or after Guava 18 is released and we can rely on snapshots.
Remove closing </li> tags.
Add Funnels.sequentialFunnel, an Iterable funnel wrapper, to Funnels.
Add @CheckReturnValue to the following classes: EvictingQueue, FluentIterable, and Ordering.
Some more cleanup of javadoc. Add specific language regarding undirected graphs since I feel the behavior there is non-obvious.

Fix presidential history, a.k.a. - the Multimap javadoc.
Add some missing dependencies in a GWT module.

Remove hardcoded graph toString() tests. Instead, simply verify that every node and edge appears in the graph's string representation. This is done for a few reasons:
Fix "Feburary" typo.
Remove references to on-demand computation of values.
Change TypeToken.method() and TypeToken.constructor() equals implementation such that List<Integer>.get() is unequal to List<String>.get() and List.get()
Reduce the memory usage of Networks by roughly 20%. Delete the IncidentNodes class. Remove (unused) equals/hashcode impl from NodeConnections. Additionally, removeEdge() is now O(1) in all cases (used to be O(D) for networks with parallel edges). edgesConnecting() is now O(1) for networks that don’t allow parallel edges (used to be O(D), even though a network without parallel edges cannot return > 1 edge for this method).
Restore documentation that Futures.catching is available under GWT but with some caveats.
Replace constants (static final CONSTANT_CASE) declaration type which use the general collection interface (e.g. List) with an immutable type (e.g. ImmutableList).
Add ImmutableMap.Builder.orderEntriesByValue.
Expand BiMapTestSuiteBuilder's tests for setValue calls on entries (which get run on both forward and backward BiMaps).
Fix Maven warning from duplicate Animal Sniffer reference:
Add a single parity test with known output from SMHasher (python).
Optimization of RegularImmutableMap.
Reformatting.

Add MediaType matching according to the model defined in the HTTP/1.1 Accept header.
ValueGraph.java: restore edgeValueOrNull() to edgeValueOrDefault().
Swap the nodes of an unordered EndpointPair to prevent callers from relying on the "ordering" of an unordered pair. Remove some superfluous "this." prefixes in ElementOrder (we generally only include "this." when assigning to a member variable).
bump version to r08-SNAPSHOT
Add @since 20.0 to the {ceiling,floor}PowerOfTwo methods.

Stop scaring Cache.asMap() users away from new Java 8 methods, which Louis made

Rollback gwt.xml change.
Fix edge case in EnumMultiset.remove
Temporarily avoid scrubbing cgdecker's username.
manual sync
Correct gender off-by-one error. :)
Make Graphs.oppositeNode() slightly more efficient. It performs the same number of equals checks (1 in self-loop case, 2 otherwise) but without the additional call to contains() - while still providing the incidence check.
Stop toString() on Stats and PairedStats throwing when the count is zero.
Test no-arg get() on pending Futures, even in a non-GWT setting.
Update Mockito version to 2.1.0-RC.1
Adds content security policy (CSP) headers, which are used by older user agents.
Add the most basic portion of our testing infrastructure required to make the Guava tests pass, and add a replacement for Assert.* so we can have the assertions available to the tests in this core library, without forcing a dependency on JUnit or any other testing framework.  The tests, themselves, of course, can remain dependent on JUnit.
Automated g4 rollback of changelist 158168944.

Remove the deprecated Service methods.
Add missing test case for emptiesLast.
Assorted cleanup:
Add @CheckReturnValue to more BaseEncoding APIs.
Reformat much of util.concurrent.
Remove com.google.common.labs.reflect.Signature. It has not gained any uses in
Change Hashing.smear to use MurmurHash3's mixK1, which appears slightly faster and more effective for use in open-addressed hash tables.
Small javadoc tweaks to Stopwatch based on external Guava issue #1492.
Add AsyncLoadingCache internally.
Added tests for Lists.IndexOfImpl
Add Multimaps.toMultimap(keyFunction, valueFunction, multimapSupplier) collector.
Add some performance enhancements to Striped:
Fixed a typo in the Predicates class documentation.

Update guava-gwt version to 23.0-SNAPSHOT; missed this last time since it isn't under current.
Micro-optimize, especially for runs of ASCII.
Make TreeMultimap.asMap() and keySet() return NavigableMap/NavigableSet, falling back to SortedMap/SortedSet on GWT.
Annotate AsyncFunction parameter as @Nullable.
rename MapMakerTests to MapMakerTest for Guava's sake
Added new API to allow filtering methods by return types:
Update Public Suffix List.
Shuffling from internal-only change.
Skip Map+Multimap toString() tests if NON_STANDARD_TOSTRING is specified.
Eliminate SingletonImmutableSet, partially folding it into RegularImmutableSet.
Make it so ValueGraph no longer extends Graph. Instead, provide a ValueGraph.asGraph() method. In a followup change, this will allow us to handle equals()/hashCode() "normally" and delete the Graphs.equivalent() methods.
Remove unnecessary string concatenation
- For a Collection<T> parameter that we don't know how to generate, fail the test. Previously, we would sometimes generate a Collection<String>, since the value is usually used only for equals() and hashCode() testing. (All this also applies to most other JDK and Guava collection types.) http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/issues/detail?id=1665
Migrate from jsr305's @CheckReturnValue to Error Prone's.


Fix bug in Helpers.isEmpty.
Fix a minor oversight in using a constant in LongMath for its intended purpose.
Migrate remaining Multiset.elementSet() tests to MultisetTestSuiteBuilder.
More reformatting.
Batch of 18 days' worth of changes, which I should be itemizing (sorry).
Add reverse methods to all primitive arrays in common.primitives.
add Cache.getAll and CacheLoader.loadAll
Make MediaType fully GWT-compatible.
Add @CheckReturnValue to the com.google.common.{escape|xml|html} packages and subpackages. This forces the caller of these APIs to "do something" with the result of the call.
Add NetworkBuilder.immutable().
Run nested classes in the open-source build.
Fix Guava Javadoc warnings.
Update the travis configurations to only build the "master" branch or any branches prefixed with "release" in order to reduce the duplicate use of build bots on travis for pull requests based on non-user-fork-originated branches.
Removing MoreAsserts call
Change bitCount from int to long.
Move the invokeAny implementation to a static method that can be used by ListentingExecutorService that don't extend AbstractListeningExecutorService.

Add fragment escaper.
Added AbstractPackageSanityTests to apply automated sanity tests for an entire package.
Update Guava to Truth 0.24
Add @CheckReturnValue to the com.google.common.util.concurrent package. This forces the caller of these APIs to "do something" with the result of the call.
Define equality for Graphs so that a Graph never equals a ValueGraph. This allows ValueGraphs to have the expected behavior when you query valueGraphA.equals(valueGraphB) (i.e. values are taken into account as well).
Make GWT less spammy for Travis CI builds by changing its log level to INFO.
Deprecate the constructors in com.google.common.base.Stopwatch and Stopwatch#elapsedMillis and #elapsedTime.
Add some missing @Beta's for new stuff in 20.0.
Update definitions of equals() and hashCode() for Graph/Network. The new hashCode() shouldn't change any behavior (of course) but should be more efficient for directed graphs. equals() does change behavior in certain corner cases (see [] but it was arguably broken before. To keep things simple, we now flat out say directed != undirected.
- Stop manually stripping @MediumTest. MOE has stripped it automatically for a while. Remove end-of-line comments that were interfering with stripping in this particular case.
Minor collections cleanups.
Document RFC 1123 host label digit prefix mandate
Add more class-level documentation and examples for RangeSet.
Migrate from jsr305 @Nullable to Checker Framework @NullableDecl.
Add missing @Nullable to Preconditions.
deprecated/remove LoadingCache methods from Cache

Simplify the implementation of LongMath.sqrt.
Provide information about which parameter we were passing null for and what values we used for the other parameters -- even if another exception was thrown.

Open source Comparators.
Adds a ForwardingDeque.

Add ConcurrentNavigableMapTestSuiteBuilder, which also applies the ConcurrentMap testers to the sub-map views.
Add scheduled deletion date of June 2016 to deprecated methods in Objects.
Minor changes to TearDownStack:
Mark DoubleMath as @GwtCompatible, allowing these methods to be used from GWT code:
Simplify ImmutableList and its implementations.
ignores.
Make Ints.{to,from}ByteArray GWT compatible.
Removes java/util GWT emul dependency
Add @GwtIncompatible annotations to top-level classes.
Add caliper as a dependency.
Remove the *degree() methods from the Graph/Network interfaces. In a followup CL, we'll add a (correct) implementation of degree() as a static utility method in Graphs. But I'd like to get the client-affecting changes (i.e. ones where the longer I wait the more merge conflicts I get) out ASAP.
Add javadoc and test coverage stating that non-hypergraph edges are always incident to either one or two nodes.
{*Graph, Network}.java: change documentation of allowsSelfLoops() and allowsParallelEdges() to correct the type of exception that is thrown when one attempts to modify them in a way that the constraint prevents (e.g., adding a self-loop to a graph that doesn't allow them).

Add Stopwatch.elapsed() which returns a java.time.Duration
Add collectors for ImmutableRangeSet and ImmutableRangeMap.
Replace http://errorprone.info with https://errorprone.info since that site
Add submitAsync and scheduleAsync methods, to ease the deprecation of Futures.dereference
Expanding test coverage on several methods

Add toString() overloads for all of the singleton enums in c.g.common.primitives
Refactor tests for BiMaps to use BiMapTestSuiteBuilder.
Optimize CharMatcher as described in Guava issue 1223.
Remove TODO, which is no longer an issue now that we're committing to GWT 2.8.0.
Improve initial approximation to sqrt(x) when x.doubleValue() == Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY (x >= 2^1024).
Tiny simplifications to HashBiMap.
Rewrite HashBiMap to share entries between the forward and backward maps, yielding ~38% savings on memory.
Move Network validation into a static method (will be useful for adding Network coverage to MutationTest later).
Link to one templating system as an example.
Add Ints.tryParse. The implementation is based off that of Android's java.lang.Integer#parseInt.
Add nullness annotations on the fields in AbstractSortedMultiset.java

Remove unused imports and warnings.
Warn not to call any default methods on the map returned by Cache.asMap().
specify 1.6 as source/target for maven-compiler-plugin
Fix range typo in comments of subRangeMap.
Add the following method to the Graph interface:
Implement Range.isContiguousWith(Range), which defines the conditions under which two ranges will be coalesced in RangeSet.
Added filter(SortedSet) to allow for the creation of a filtered SortedSet
Fix a bug in AbstractFuture.setFuture
Release Java 8 changes to Guava.
Remove oraclejdk10 from Travis build.
Add missing @Override annotations
Make ListenableScheduledFuture GwtCompatible.
Take steps to fix Cache.refresh race condition.  Specifically, do a racy check outside the lock to see if the value is already being refreshed, and do an optional check inside the lock to eliminate the race condition entirely.
Improve ImmutableCollection.asList(), making more asList views delegate contains() queries to the backing collection.
move LocalCache into LocalCacheInternalMap, then rename LocalCacheInternalMap to LocalCache
Shuffling from internal change.
remove build.xml, and unneeded libs

Deprecate implementations of Function.apply that should never be invoked directly.
Changed AbstractInvocationHandler#equals() and hashCode() to delegate to the invocation handler, to allow customization. I needed it to create dynamic proxies that works for SerializableTester.reserializeAndAssert().
Fix generics in Cache which are breaking the MOE build.
Open-source known hashes for crc32, triggered by our new automated test that expects to find them.
Move a comment that had become out of place.
common.graph: fix formatting error in Graph/ValueGraph/Network Javadoc.
GWT/Guava maintenance:
Add @CheckReturnValue to MapMaker.
Remove tests for Multimap.get from AbstractMultimapTest that duplicate tests in MultimapTestSuiteBuilder
Fix JSR305 links yet again.

Prepare for Public Suffic List update, which removes the '!' rule that this file was using.
Add @Nullable to AbstractSequentialIterator's computeNext() method return value so that [] doesn't complain
Applied package sanity test to common.cache. I had to add some checkNotNull() to LocalCache and CacheLoader, based on my understanding of the javadoc. Though it does change the contract: some didn't throw NPE on null, some threw UncheckedExecutionException.
Use compact data structures in ImmutableMultimap builders.
Add missing @throws tags to Verify.
Continue migrating to type annotations for @Nullable
Release more Queues methods: newAD, newLBD
Make ArrayTable gwt compatible.
Use com.google.caliper.legacy.Benchmark instead of com.google.caliper.Benchmark. This CL facilitates the move from a superclass-based API to an annotation-based API. Benchmark and legacy.Benchmark are equivalent classes, so this is NOT a behavior changing CL.
Split CloseablesTest into CloseablesTest and FlushablesTest.
Bump Checker Framework annotations version to 2.5.2.
Tiny cleanups after cl 35973933. Fixed a spurious character that snuck in and extra spacing.
Use a binary release of Truth.
Update public suffix list.
Promise at least weakly consistent iteration for asMap().
Sort and removed unused imports in com/google/common.

Rename MutableGraph.addEdge(N, N) to MutableGraph.putEdge(N, N) (to indicate that Graphs do not support parallel edges and for consistency with the upcoming ValueGraph interface). Change the order of parameters in MutableNetwork.addEdge(E, N, N) to MutableNetwork.addEdge(N, N, E).
Manually reject leading plus signs since JDK7 won't.
Group overloads together.
Add a constructor to VerifyException to permit a cause to provided alongside a message.
Document the weird problem with Optional<? extends T> along with its workaround.
One last (?) round of presizing builders where possible in common.collect.

Remove assorted unused fields and variables.
Hasher#putString(CharSequence) to Hasher#putUnencodedChars(CharSequence)
Fix LocalCache.compute deadlock issue, also added unittests.
Replace a couple usages of Iterators.emptyIterator().
Add the methods Graph.hasEdge() and ValueGraph.hasEdge(). Also add some test coverage for ValueGraph.asGraph().

Release HostAndPortTest.
Major refactoring of EventBus, in preparation for further changes.
This CL fixes method calls that incorrectly ignore the return
Instead of using the SortedLists utility class, go straight to Collections.binarySearch in the implementation of RegularImmutableSortedSet.
Big code drop in prep for cutting r04 next week.
Upgrade Truth to 0.33.
Make ListenableFutureTask non-final but not subclassable externally.
Expand on "question 3" from the graph/network javadoc, which I felt was a little hard to parse. Also some misc. javadoc cleanup.
Add .intersects() to RangeSet.
More test coverage!
Accidentally removed -use and -linksource from javadoc task.
Move SortedMaps.difference to Maps
CharMatcher space improvements (Small = same trick used for Whitespace, Medium = traditional hash table, large = what we do now).
reorganize hash tests
Add another test for Iterables.removeIf.
Add @since tags and nitpick Javadoc formatting from CL 52250001.
Internal GWT change.

Add MediaType.withParameters(String attribute, Iterable<String> values)
Start ConcurrentMapTestSuiteBuilder, adding a tester for putIfAbsent.
Have more helpful error messages.
Make the copying done for guava-gwt not verbose.
call newBuilder
Test that changes to an Iterator are reflected in the backing collection.
Add a method to Uri that allows us to get the port (via HostAndPort).
Polishing
To generate random hashable things, use Random instead of Object hash codes.
Add @CheckReturnValue to Joiner, Objects, and Splitter.
Change some javadoc to reference node U and V in the context of connectivity (to be consistent with methods on EndpointPair).
Make AbstractFuture#done protected & rename it #afterDone to decrease chance of collision with existing subclasses.
Remove the redundant (inherited from Graph) adjacentNodes() method from Network, as well as some other javadoc cleanup I missed in []
Remove unneeded and unavailable inherits from testModule.gwt.xml files.
Some javadoc tweaking to NullPointerTester. Please comment away, I have absolutely no confidence in my wordsmithing
Deprecate Stopwatch#elapsedTime, Stopwatch#elapsedMillis, and Range#asSet.
Get rid of usages of TestUtil from common.io test classes and open source most of FilesTest.
Update public suffix list.
Add c.g.c.net.HttpHeaders to Guava (since 11.0).
Some small fixes for Guava (methods called were @GI).
Implement Object#equals() and #hashCode() for stateful HashFunctions.
Change all instances of encoded.subSequence() to use a simple start index offset, which reduces the Java memory footprint for TrieParser by at at least 130 MBs. This is because the original call to subSequence() would generate a new String on the heap for each call, where as just using an offset avoids the need to generate a new String all together.
@GoogleInternal a helper method that's only used by an @GoogleInternal test.
Return to scrubbing cgdecker's username, which we temporarily stopped doing in 69045357f5b4.
Just cleaning up old @since tags.
Among the Futures methods that run user callbacks, those that don't take an Executor will be deleted.  This CL migrates them to the counterparts that take MoreExecutors.directExecutor() as such Executor in the parameter list, exactly the way that the old method works.
Just a little reformatting.
Ensure that AbstractIterator does not hold onto its next reference after it has been returned by next().
Change the return type of Network.incidentNodes() from Set<N> to Endpoints<N>. This also replaces the source() and target() methods on Network and moves them to Endpoints.
Migrate users of the deprecated HashFunction#hashString(CharSequence) to HashFunction#hashUnencodedChars(CharSequence).
Introduce Strings.lenientFormat(), copied from Preconditions.format(). Rewrote documentation but the method body remains unchanged.
Avoid allocating for Multimap.removeAll(absentKey) implementations.
HashIterator fix for LocalCache
Increase GWT test timeout.
Automated g4 rollback of changelist 57771110.
Refactor the three places in common.collect that we convert a List<E> to an ImmutableMap<E, Integer>.
Link pages to the wiki.
Major refactoring of the com.google.common.graph APIs (including updates to client code):
Make ListeningScheduledExecutorService.schedule* return a ListenableFuture
Some tweaks to the Endpoints class:
1. Omit sun.security.* methods from our Android tests.

Support reflection-less atomic updates in AggregateFutureState and InterruptibleTask as in AbstractFuture.
Delete Multimap.contains{Key,Value} tests from AbstractMultimapTest that are redundant with MultimapContains{Key,Value}Tester.
Initial release of the escapers into Guava.
Expose Hashing.concatenating() in Guava.
don't allow garbage collected values to be "copied"
Add Immutable{Map,BiMap}.builderWithExpectedSize API.

Update javadoc. The previous sample code was not actually doing what the comment describes. In particular, it was calling adjacentNodes() instead of successors(). The comment says "all nodes reachable from node", but adjacentNodes() will also travel AGAINST the direction of the edge (not necessarily "reachable" in the directed case).
Also benchmark creating SortedSets, which predictably fare worst, but at least
Update the hashing benchmark to include all of the different hash

Fix bug in Optional#presentInstances.
[guava concurrent] Renamed SerializingExecutor to SequentialExecutor. Turned SerializingExecutor into a proxy to SequentialExecutor so two Components classes that directly use it have a chance to catch up.
Fixes deadlocks in LocalCache.asMap().compute() if the Function throws
Open source the HMAC hashing libraries (@since 20.0).
Prepare for release 25.1.
Fix indentation.

Fix calls to deprecated Stopwatch.elapsedMillis() by inlining that method's implementation ("elapsed(MILLISECONDS)").
Deprecated NPT.ignore(Member); added ignore(Method) overload as the new preferred method. No one ignores constructor in []. And the code to ignore constructor would read less meaningful.
Fix ForwardingMultimapTest
Admit that the TestSuiteBuilder classes aren't *really* GWT-compatible, despite our hacks to make them appear so.
Implement Sets.cartesianProduct to iterate in lexicographical order.  In the process, Lists.cartesianProduct has been implemented on a package-private basis.
Add a simple unit test for AbstractCache#aggregate.
Rollback
Remove no-longer-needed suppression method.
Use Map convenience methods in a few more places.
Omit some unnecessary parens

Add @since 23.0 to new (or with new return type) edgeValue methods in ValueGraph.
Suppress warnings from existing nested futures.
Remove "SetView" from all graph implementations. See [] for why it should be killed with fire. In particular, it made the returned Sets have O(N) (in both time and memory) size() and contains() methods, and in one case, O(N^2) iteration!
I tripped and rewrote HashBiMap in the fully compact form, with no redundant code or storage, like I had assumed was too much work.

De-@Betaify AtomicDouble and AtomicDoubleArray.
Optimize BigIntegerMath.binomial to use long arithmetic for as much as possible.
Update truth to 0.11
Remove most of our uses of <code>.

*Graph.java: add @since NEXT to incidentEdges(), and retire the use of @inheritDoc in favor of just copying the documentation over wholesale.  (This preserves the @throws tags in the subinterfaces.)
Fix javadoc warnings.

Add a test that ensures any new HashFunctions must have an entry in
Add tests:
Move htmlEscaper to the top.

Minor readability and coverage improvements to Utf8Test:
Use byte[]/short[]/int[] for hashtable depending on size

JavaDoc grammar fix.
Prepare for release 27.1.

Implementation of Sets.combinations(Set, int), approved by []
Javadoc improvements:
Include all source files as resources in guava-gwt jar.
Strip <resource> lines from .gwt.xml. They are not yet supported by a release version of GWT. (Support was added in internal CL 62367280, which imported <https://gwt.googlesource.com/gwt/+/f39e11150ef0ea635a7f7d30154221907775efc6>. I'm not sure when our build was changed to generate the new elements.)

(w/lowasser) Streams.forEachPair()
Suppress log output from tests in the console by redirecting it to files.

Add streaming encoding and decoding to BaseEncoding.
Trivial fallout from internal-only change.

Change BaseEncoding.toString() to return "withPadChar('=')" instead of "withPadChar(=)". This is more consistent with how the string literals are printed for the alphabet.
Fix the serialization of sparse immutable tables.
Simplify ImmutableMultiset implementations.
Update to new Truth package.
Give date-based deletions a stay of execution (24 months, not 18).

Add testers for ConcurrentMap.replace(K, V, V).

Adopt getDone() and getDoneFromTimeoutOverload() in other Future tests.
Use diamond operator.
Add convenience methods for e0().getKey(), etc., and migrate to them.
Include test.txt in Guava to fix ClassPathTest.
Clean up some exceptions. In general, the pattern we try to follow is that if the user provides an invalid argument (e.g. a node not in a graph), we throw an IllegalStateException with a detailed error message. If it's an internal method and something is wrong on our end, we throw an IllegalStateException (and don't usually bother with an error message).
Deprecate ComparisonChain#compare(Boolean, Boolean).
Remove an unused import.
Update README to point to 20.0 as the latest release and update version numbers to 21.0-SNAPSHOT.

Add more null values to NullValues, and rename to ArbitraryInstances.
Fix typo in GraphBuilder.nodeOrder() javadoc.
Just reduce the default expectedValuesPerKey for HashMultimap from 8 to 2,
Add @CheckReturnValue to com.google.common.reflect. This forces the caller of these APIs to "do something" with the result of the call.
Wrap the Method.setAccessible call in Types.TypeVariableInvocationHandler in try/catch so that it is not an error for it to fail.

Add Queues.synchronizedDeque(Deque<E>).
Rewrite the Tld Pattern generator, take 2.
Overhaul of the Queues javadocs on the static factory methods.

manual sync
Update Preconditions overloads that were added in 20.0 to have @since 20.0 and new Verify overloads to have @since NEXT.
Fix Striped.lazyWeakReadWriteLock so that holding on to just the read or just the write lock will not allow the ReadWriteLock to be garbage collected, which many users find surprising.
Provide better documentation for the state transitions that are legal/illegal for a Service to make.  Also change the behavior of service.start() such that it will now throw exceptions when trying to start a TERMINATED or FAILED service.
Make all AbstractFutures behave like TrustedFutures under GWT.
test when resetOnFinalize==true

Add missing nullable annotations on the fields in the cache package.
Add tryParse implementation for Doubles and Floats.
Correct two typos in IDN doc.
Increase test coverage for Networks. Add clarifying statement in javadoc for inEdges() and outEdges(). Modify the sanityCheck method to also check that a set is equals() to its ImmutableSet copy (this will also make sure the set doesn't have duplicate elements).
Make Enums.getIfPresent ~16 times faster for 80% hit rate, ~72 times faster for 20% hit rate.
Marks the methods in Longs regarding byte array conversions as GWT compatible,
Add lazyStackTrace.
Enable GoodTime API checker for guava-testlib.
Doc-only changes to the InternetDomainName family clarifying validation options and fixing some references to deprecated methods.
Change the definition of hashcode for Networks (map of edges to endpoints) to more closely mirror hashcode for Graphs (map of edges to value). Also the map we're basing the hashcode on is now half the size for undirected networks, which is nice (a downside is that isolated nodes don't affect the hashcode, but I'm not too worried about that).
add CacheBuilder.refreshInterval
A few small hash changes.
Add "et" as an effective TLD.
Update public suffix list.
Start running the tests for guava-testlib under Android.
Open-source RangeSet/RangeMap classes so that Louis can rebase his http://code.google.com/r/wassermanlouis-guava/source/detail?r=fb106087948b2c0da9f5f6ed610d2df3ebb0240a&name=rangemap on top of them.
Multicatch!
Change javadoc to refer to Mutable* interfaces. Technically, Graph/Network don't dictate anything when adding edges, because they don't have methods for adding edges.
Add @CheckReturnValue to UnsignedBytes, UnsignedInts, and UnsignedLongs (except for parse methods and methods that throw exceptions that people may reasonably want to catch).
Forbid empty ranges in ImmutableRangeMap.Builder.
Suppress another test that's flaky on Android.
Remove now-unused dependency on the Checker Framework compatibility annotations
Applied package sanity tests to common.io
Publish j2objc cycle_whitelist.txt to the public Guava repo.
Fix Guava GWT module:
AbstractNetwork: add a functionally correct (if not super-efficient) implementation of edgesConnecting(), because it's easy to do wrong.
Update GWT deps to 2.8.0-rc2.
Integrate common.math into common.collect.
remove from Guava methods which were scheduled for deletion in release 12.0
Use maven-javadoc-plugin 3.0.1.

Small fixes to some incorrect @since tags.
Add @Beta to Optional#or(Supplier) and Optional#or(Optional).

Create TrustedListenableFutureTask so that our listener executor services can produce futures compatible with the new setFuture optimization.
Shuffling from internal-only change.
Automated g4 rollback of changelist 151172294.
Plug a bunch of unit testing holes in common.net.

Give MapMaker the same workaround as Cache for Android's concurrency-unsafe toArray() implementation.
Suppress tests under Android.
Rewrite the AbstractFuture Javadoc.
Update Mozilla public suffix list from 2013-06-06 to 2013-11-07.
Add additional test of existing behavior of Splitter.limit(n)
Add @CheckReturnValue to CaseFormat, Enums, Equivalence, Joiner, MoreObjects, Strings and Suppliers.
Fix OSGI metadata creation in Guava build.
Make degree(node) on directed networks O(1) instead of O(D), at the cost of a teensy bit of memory (a self loop counter). In actuality it doesn't seem to take up any extra memory, perhaps due to how the object is padded/aligned. Additionally, this CL makes iterating through incidentEdges() slightly faster on directed networks if no self-loops are present. In the undirected case, adding and removing self-loop edges is now slightly faster.
Make minor simplifications to WellBehavedMap, and small optimizations to ForwardingSet.

In the FinalizableReferenceQueue code, remove the unnecessary nested exception
Make BaseEncoding @GwtCompatible.
Suppress log output from tests in guava-testlib by redirecting it to files.
Changed NullPointerTester to use Invokable
common.graph: remove j2cl annotations, as no one's using it from j2cl, it has no immediate prospective users, and it doesn't support Network-related capabilities anyway.
Fix https://github.com/google/guava/issues/2125 by having all the AbstractService delegate classes forward their toStrings() to their outer impls.
Update testers to recognize that null may be a restricted element
Changed ClassSanityTester.testEquals() to check against use of == on objects. We assume that the implementations should call equals()

Automated g4 rollback of changelist 146841288.
Add specialized slice support to ByteArrayByteSource.
Redo: Use the context class loader in Resources.getResource(String), instead of
Remove references to SourceCodeEscapers from javadoc.
More reformatting.
Make some minor simplifications in common.base.

Delete tests from AbstractMultimapTest of the multimap views in isolation, that is, tests that initialize the multimap, get the view, and don't reference the multimap afterwards.
Add an Automatic-Module-Name manifest entry.
Delete redundant performance overloads from SingletonImmutableList.
Remove the public equal/hashCode/toString methods from Graphs. There are a variety of reasons for doing this:
Some additional test coverage for undirected graphs + minor cleanup.
Add Files.fileTraverser().
Simplify ImmutableCollection implementation and related code.  Specifically:
Merge GraphErrorMessageUtils into GraphConstants.
Re-fix https://github.com/google/guava/issues/3081.
Output "java.util.Map.Entry" under Java 9, as the JDK does.
Delete WellBehavedMap.
Fix ForwardingList documentation.
common.graph tests: unify some duplicate constructs (enums, methods, constants) and put them in TestUtil.java.
Update Truth dependency to 0.31 and add truth-java8-extension dependency for guava-gwt tests.
Make the shortcut methods in the new hashing API faster by using the legacy implementations.
Fix https://github.com/google/guava/issues/3081.
In Java 8 branch, fall back to j.u.HashMap based implementation in ImmutableBiMap if hash flooding appears probable.  (Partially motivated by external feature requests, partially by []
Adds BloomFilter#mergeWith(BloomFilter).
Irrelevant no-op diff created by internal-only changes.
Add emptiesFirst/Last to Comparators for easily comparing java.util.Optional
Add "stateless and thread-safe" to the HashFunction javadocs.
Make log level for GWT configurable for Maven builds.
Change x == x to equivalent isNaN() in preparation for making it a compile error.
remove escapers from Guava (won't make it for Guava 12)
This change replaces usages of static final fields on CharMatcher, e.g. CharMatcher.WHITESPACE, with the equivalent static factory method, e.g. CharMatcher.whitespace().
Mark a test that uses StringBuilder.appendCodePoint as GwtIncompatible.
Add a validation check to AbstractDirectedGraphTest, opposite to the one in AbstractUndirectedGraphTest:
Migrate from Truth's deprecated iteratesAs(...) to containsExactly(...).inOrder().
Make ImmutableCollection.contains abstract, and fix some embarrassing oversights of where it should have been overridden.
Added code example to AbstractInvocationHandler to suggest users to use Reflection.newProxy().
Specify behavior with self-loops in degree() javadoc.
Remove the "? super" from the return type of the nodeOrder/edgeOrder methods. It doesn't actually provide any additional functionality for the user, just a mild annoyance. Also this is in line with the recommendation here:
Make all "Tester" classes *end* with "Tester," and simplify our exclusions accordingly.
Add *degree() methods back to Graph/Network interfaces, with correct formal definition this time (self-loops count twice).
Remove @CheckReturnValue from individual classes now that it is in
Optimize CharStreams.copy to take advantage of known Readable/Appendable types.
De-betaify c.g.c.annotations.Beta
Improve EvictingQueue.addAll()'s performance by skipping the head of
Use ImmutableSet.of().iterator() instead of Iterators.emptyIterator().

Replace usages of deprecated Objects.toStringHelper() with
Don't specify weakValues in a flaky test where it's not required.
(These changes apply ONLY to our Google-internal Android-specific copy of Guava.)
common.graph classes: clean up documentation, change Object references to generic type indicators where possible in the internal implementation classes (this was already done for the public APIs).
Move ClassInSubpackage... actually into a subpackage. This looks to have not been moved correctly when forking common.reflect
Optimize DenseImmutableTable so that it doesn't rebuild rows and columns on the fly.
Add dummy test methods to Compact(Linked)HashSetTest so that the Maven test runner doesn't complain.
Use specialized entry types for ImmutableMap, and use these in the builders to avoid redundant copying of entries.
Remove @Beta from Throwables.throwIfInstanceOf() and throwIfUnchecked().
Remove public constructors from SimpleTimeLimiter.
Document the purpose of the or() compilation tests.
Makes FreshValueGenerator more friendly to collection types especially immutable collection types. This reduces false positives and also reduces the need to set sample instances for collection types.
Update AtomicDouble in Java 7 to use AtomicLong directly instead of AtomicLongFieldUpdater.  This is a relatively simple way of protecting against bugs like the Samsung bug, and clm@ and I agreed that the simplification over what e.g. AbstractFuture has had to do was worth the extra allocation.
Fix up .gwt.xml file as a part of some internal changes.
Implement Multisets.filter(Multiset, Predicate)
Roll back CL 23327883's very broken FeatureSpecificTestSuiteBuilder optimization.
Add note about nodes being valid Map keys to PredecessorsFunction and SuccessorsFunction.
Shuffling from internal-only changes.
Add HashFunction#hashObject() shortcut.
More strictly restrict when fields are added to the set of relevant fields, only supporting non-synthetic String fields.
Change CacheBuilder constructor modifier to private, and
Remove open-source project and code which provides a backported Java6-style ExecutorService for Java5 compatibility, with all the extra build steps involved in using it.
Deprecate Closeables.closeQuietly.
Add elementSet and entrySet tests to MultisetTestSuiteBuilder.
Open source tests for ByteSource.read(ByteProcessor) and CharSource.readLines(LineProcessor).
Fix broken generic types in ElementOrder. Added two tests, neither of which compile with the existing code!
Enable GoodTime API checker for Guava
Add missing GWT emulation of interruptTask().
more gwt test standardization
Fix tests that failed if we couldn't recursively delete securely by using Jimfs and just getting rid of the whole file system each time.
Refactor the test classes from the previous hierarchy:
Collections coming from ImmutableRangeSet.asSet() and ImmutableRangeMap.asMapOfRanges() can now be correctly serialized.
Fix bad line breaks.
Automatically release snapshots to Maven and Javadoc/JDiff to gh-pages on push.

Make some AbstractMapBasedMultimap helper methods static.  (As part of the process, make Sets.unmodifiableNavigableSet GWT-compatible, as NavigableSet is no longer an issue.)
Update link to GWT docs that died with Google Code.
Skip unnecessary presizing.
In EnumsTest, rewrite code that creates a second copy of TestEnum in a second ClassLoader, so that it doesn't try to add instances of the second TestEnum to a Set<TestEnum> (which is a Set of the original TestEnum). In Java 8, apparently this is a little bit less erased so it fails.

Remove some email addresses from @author tags.
Implement expireAfter*(0, *) in terms of maximumSize(0).
Add @CheckReturnValue to Ascii.

Refactorings in util.concurrent so more code can be shared.
Add nullness annotations on the fields in DescendingMultiset.java
Test for resources.toByteArray
Strip out comments pertaining to maximumSize() and expireAfterWrite() (which are no longer public).
Suppress soon to be GoodTime errors ('time' is now considered a keyword).
Change SortedMapTestSuiteBuilder and DerivedCollectionGenerators to correctly handle SortedMaps whose keySet()s are not SortedSets--the spec of SortedMap.keySet() doesn't require that it return a SortedSet, and it apparently didn't at least for TreeMap in JDK5.
Add Multimaps.asMap() helpers that return a Map with more
Catch NoClassDefFoundError and generic Error, the types thrown by JVM8 and by modern versions of Android.
Java6 cleanups for Guava 12.0
Instead of skipping testDivNonZeroExact entirely under Android, skip only the problematic cases.
Annotate checkNotNull's input and output as @NonNull.
Take advantage of new GWT AbstractFuture tests to enhance overall AbstractFuture testing:
Promote StandardSystemProperty to @Beta in 15.0
Reduce allocation in Iterators.concat.
ValueGraph: fix implementation of edgeValueOrDefault().
Enable source artifact generation in all builds on guava, and use that plus other resources to build the Guava-gwt artifact. Then enable the gwt artifact in the aggregate build.
Remove no-op main methods from Caliper benchmarks.
Remove obsolete maven configuration which used to merge in METADATA.MF files into the jar, but no longer needs to, since maven will just scoop up the created METADATA.MF produced by the osgi bundle generator.
Remove @CanIgnoreReturnValue from c.g.c.collect.ClassToInstanceMap.getInstance()
Fix the issue with classes that should only be included in the failureaccess artifact being included in the main Guava jar.
In Java 8 branch, fall back to an ImmutableSet backed by j.u.HashSet (and its binary tree magic) if apparent hash flooding is detected.
Create constants for the SourceMap header
And let's rename Utf8.length() one more time, this time to Utf8.encodedLength().
Implement HashFunction#hashString shortcut for murmur3_32

Add a gap method to Range which computes the range that lies between two ranges. This operation is particularly useful as a replacement for Joda Time's Interval.gap when migrating to Java Time which has no Interval class.
Bump version of maven-dependency-plugin.
Deprecated Throwables.propagate()
Make SloppyTearDown.logger private.
Miscellaneous cleanups.
Expire entries at insertion+duration instead of insertion+duration+1 to be consistent with the GWT emulation and, we hope, with common sense.
Add an autoIncrementStep to FakeTicker, similar to the autoIncrementStep in FakeClock
Expand common.hash ByteBuffer support, adding a default AbstractHasher hashBytes implementation and expanding HashTestUtils to test more about the hashing of ByteBuffers.
Automated g4 rollback of changelist 110542265.
Test default Charset.
Reformat common.base with google-java-format, to 100 columns. A few changes by hand as discussed.

Disallow null-returning suppliers in Optional#or
ImmutableRangeMap is now serializable.
Optimize ContiguousSet.asList() for the three built-in DiscreteDomains.
Make sure all public classes/interfaces in common.graph have @Beta and @since.
add Cache.getIfPresent, Cache.put, and CacheBuilder.build()
Fix FunnelsTest to @GI Funnels.sequentialFunnel tests
Explicitly test that BREAKING_WHITESPACE is a subset of WHITESPACE.
Add some validation checks for undirected graphs.
Remove a stray @Beta annotation on a test.
Reduce the number of different ranges TreeRangeMap attempts to test with; these were taking exorbitant amounts of time in Android tests.
Move GenerateTldPatterns to a new directory.

Shuffling from internal-only change. Will be reverted soon.
Prepare for release 24.0.
Deprecate softValues, not weakValues.
Avoid having a static Joiner constant in Predicates.  This typically eliminates both Joiner and the Predicates class itself, which was prevented from being optimized away by the presence of the static constant.
Removes @WeakOuter from AggregateFuture.RunningState and subclasses. The weak
Fix minor bug in setValue method of HashBiMap.inverse().entrySet() entries.
Integration of Justin Sampson's fixes to Monitor and addition of extensive tests.

Revert parts of CL 33393713 that changed Splitter.on(",") tests to redundant Splitter.on(',') tests.
Fix some bugs related to calling Preconditions.checkNotNull on expressions
In Java 7 branch, don't bother using Iterators.forArray in RegularImmutable{List,Set}.  The default ImmutableList.listIterator implementation amounts to the same thing, an AbstractIndexedListIterator delegating to the array.

NullPointerTester should not require @Nullable on the param of an equals() override
common.graph: adding new EndpointPair-accepting overloads.

Document the relationship between Multiset and AtomicLongMap.
Discourage use of CheckedFuture.
Remove unnecessary dependency.  This modules doesn't contain any tests - the tests for this module are in guava-tests, where this is more appropriately specified.
Update an @link in javadoc.
Add EvictingQueue.remainingCapacity().

When a new entry exceeds the segment's maxWeight all by itself, don't bother evicting anything else, only the new one. Still go through all the motions of actually adding and evicting it; otherwise I fear the code complexity will skyrocket.

Add extensive tests for simplifyPath that aren't prefixed with /b/c.
I thiiiink there's a chance the current removeEdge() impl could still cause a CME. Either way, I have a change that avoids the issue and is more efficient, by removing the self node from the predecessors/successors before we start iterating through them.
Create sameThreadScheduledExecutor().
Optimize collapseFrom and trimAndCollapseFrom so that they

Ensure that recordStats works on Android, GWT, and environments which may restrict the use of sun.misc.Unsafe, as per Guava issue 1228.
Add missing @Nullable to Finalizer.
Rename NodeConnections to NetworkConnections and NodeAdjacencies to GraphConnections. Have a base interface called "NodeConnections". This change is just cosmetic right now (although we do refer to these things as "connections" everywhere, so it's nice to actually have "NodeConnections" be the base interface), but it will make more sense in the context of ValueGraph (there will be a ValueGraphConnections).
Implement edgeValue() via edgeValueOrDefault() instead of vice versa. For edgeValue() this is the same efficiency, but makes edgeValueOrDefault() perform fewer hash lookups.
Add @CheckReturnValue to Predicates.
Remove org.apache.maven.plugins, which is the default:
introduce maximumWeight
Fix GWT behavior of "opportunistic" ImmutableList subclasses.
Simplify CharStreams.skipFully.
Add ImmutableSet.builderForExpectedSize.  Currently, the implementation is that if and only if a size is specified up front, the builder starts generating the hash table online and deduping elements.
Automated g4 rollback of changelist 105235264.
Migrate guava to directExecutor now that it will be in the next release.
common.graph: add incidentEdges() method to Graph/ValueGraph.
Delete the Ordering.from(Comparator) and Ordering.natural() overrides of sortedCopy and immutableSortedCopy, since benchmarks suggest any speed increases are minimal at best.
Add NetworkMutationTest (parallel to GraphMutationTest).
GWT emulation for some of util.concurrent.
Refer to Network references as "network" instead of "graph". Note that we've already started doing this, but (as you can see) are fairly inconsistent with it.
Assorted followups from past reviews/discussions:
This change replaces usages of static final fields on CharMatcher, e.g. CharMatcher.WHITESPACE, with the equivalent static factory method, e.g. CharMatcher.whitespace().
Add missing @Nullable annotations to Table and BiMap
Re-export testdata files into Guava after CL 36707785.
Move all surefire configuration to the parent pom.
Implement CharSink.writeLines(Stream[, String]).
Clone c.g.protobuf.Utf8 to c.g.common.io.Utf8 and add new utf8Length(String) static method. Callers will be migrated in future changes. It is currently unknown whether protobuf itself will be able to depend on Guava.
Added javadoc to ClassSanityTester about a pattern to test builder equality. Added invokable.setAccessible(true) to allow public factories of non-public classes to be tested.
Link java7 branch javadocs to javase/7, not 8
Abstract common.graph classes: add Javadoc warnings that methods implemented in these classes should not be overridden without cause.
Re-add Multisets.removeOccurrences(Multiset, Multiset).
Added default-value auto generation to NullPointerTester, for interfaces (and
doc cleanup
Support type annotations in NullPointerTester
Reorganize tests for filter methods on Iterables, Collections, Sets, etc.
Comment seemingly-unnecessary bitwise mask in UnsignedInteger.
Optimize LongMath.sqrt.
Automated rollback of commit 8fd7f60484218df9a208df0edf41bdee22d86900
Fixes mismatched parentheses in Graph javadoc.
Try to improve Multimap class docs.
Optimize murmur3_32 hashString(CharSequence, UTF_8) to unroll the Utf8 directly into the hasher rather than converting it to a byte array.

Tweaks from shuffling of internal hash functions.
Graph.java: fix indentation in class-level Javadoc.
Clean up usages of deprecated Truth has() Collection methods:
Copy Reflection.getField(Enum) to Enums.getField().
fix typo
Add useful toString() for BaseEncoding
Delete AbstractSetMultimapTest, whose remaining tests are all covered by SetMultimapTestSuiteBuilder.
Run dereference() tests under GWT.
Add nullness annotations on the fields in ImmutableEntry.java
Make implicit narrowing compound assignments explicit.

Optimize ImmutableSet's hash flooding detection, using an algorithm which allows more false positives (though we calibrate the constant factors to compensate) but runs O(log n) times faster on average.
Remove import for java.util.Formatter since it's needed only for the javadoc.
Fix tests that assume Class.getClassLoader() returns a URLClassLoader so that they can call getURLs() to instead parse the "java.class.path" system property.
Upgrade truth's gwt library to a more recent snapshot and upgrade OptionalTest to verify.
Remove MapMaker: strongKeys(), strongValues(), and valueEquivalence() from MapMaker and friends.
Avoid using "i.e." in first sentence of javadoc so the javadoc generator doesn't prematurely cut off the summary.
Fixes a reference cycle between WeakValueEntry instances and their
Fix Eclipse warning (missing #).
Implement Throwables.getCauseAs(Throwable, Class), which safely casts a Throwable's cause and ensures that the exception thrown on a bad cast has the original exception as its cause.
Small optimization for node/edge containment. It wouldn't be worth it if nodes()/edges() returned they keysets directly, but wrapping in an unmodifiableset involves an extra object creation and subsequent garbage collection.
Implemented new TimeLimiter methods in SimpleTimeLimiter.
Add new RangeSet methods accepting Iterable<Range<C>>.

Remove some superfluous checkNotNulls in NetworkConnections. On the nodes/edges, these are internal classes and those parameters have already been checked. On the calls to super.remove*, they've also already been checked.
new Stopwatch(); -> Stopwatch.createUnstarted();
add support for jdiff generation
Shift the nodeOrder/edgeOrder methods down in the Graph/Network interfaces. These are definitely "properties" of the graph, and should be under the label as such. Note that the AbstractConfigurable* implementation classes already have the methods in this order.
Add Checker Framework to dependencies.
Remove misleading javadoc line (we haven't published microbenchmarks in N
Internally, use PatternCompiler from Doubles.tryParse.
Initial code dump: version 9.09.15
allow jdk6 in Guava

Remove openjdk6 as a platform to build Guava on. It fails due to a weird generics issue.
forbid null return from cache lookups, and null parameter in invalidate
Guava issue 1322: deal with a potential overflow issue in ImmutableTable.
&& -> &
Re-suppress testDivNonZeroExact, which, like testDivNonZero, is too slow.
Update Public Suffix data.
I give up. I can no longer maintain the in-place algorithm. The bugs have defeated me.
Opensource ServiceManager!
Make sure all implementations being tested by SortedMapInterfaceTest are also tested with SortedMapTestSuiteBuilders, and remove tests from SMIT that are redundant with SortedMapNavigationTester.
Publishes the new StatsAccumulator.addAll(Stats) and PairedStatsAccumulator.addAll(PairedStats) methods.
Add a direct dependency from guava-gwt to checker-qual.
Update Public Suffix List.

Delete warning that TimeLimiter might be changed significantly.
Delete Multiset.count() tests from AbstractMultisetTest that are redundant with MultisetCountTester in MultisetTestSuiteBuilder.
Push back removals again.
Remove redundant Multiset.contains() tests from AbstractMultisetTest, which are already covered in CollectionContainsTester as part of MultisetTestSuiteBuilder, and add a couple more multiset-specific tests.
Graph.java: change return type of #degree() methods to int.
[FUTURES] Added Futures.whenAllComplete(..).run(..) to Futures.java
Methods that take a node as parameter now take type N instead of Object.
Add a beans.xml file disabling CDI bean discovery to META-INF/ in the guava jar. See guava issue: https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/issues/detail?id=1433
Remove unused methods in c/g/c/{hash,reflect}/...
Adding ForwardingBlockingDeque, as it's a natural fit for Guava and something which is currently missing from the library.
Remove <E extends Enum<E>> from GWT ImmutableEnumMap, reducing code bloat.
Change Service.Listener from an interface to an abstract class with no-op implementations of all the callbacks.
Add @GwtIncompatible annotations to top-level classes.
Add nullness annotations on the fields in MapMakerInternalMap.java
Changed ArbitraryInstances to use public constant instance if present.
GWT: Better error checking, logging, and documentation.
Automated g4 rollback of changelist 94598995.
Link to the things I wrote about our Javadoc link problems.
google-java-format com.google.common.hash

Push of latest guava code which unfortunately includes temporarily backing out
Delete MapMaker.makeComputingMap() and ComputingConcurrentHashMap.
Fix compile-time constant expression overflows
Changes implementation of emulated CacheBuilder and instead emulated LocalCache. Features added include recordStats, expireAfterAccess, ticker, and removalListener. RefreshAfterWrite was implemented but removed due to reliance on reload() and returned futures.
Suppress new CollectionIncompatibleType Error Prone check by casting
Prevent fail() from being ignored by the surrounding catch() block by throwing new Error().
Add a special case for ImmutableSet.copyOf(EnumSet) delegating to Sets.immutableEnumSet.
Source and javadoc update; this will likely be r05.
Short-circuit future.setFuture(TrustedFuture) in GWT, too.
Fix https://github.com/google/guava/issues/3156 by implementing a proper CollectSpliterators.flatMapTo{Int,Long,Double}.
Remove no-op check.
Change ByteSource.concat and CharSource.concat to not blow up on infinite Iterables. This also helps users whose Iterables actually eagerly load data to create sources when iterated, though ideally they shouldn't be doing that.
Allow for arbitrary orderings in tests for lists, rather than assuming insertion order.
Added forwarder tests for various Forwarding* classes in util/concurrent. Added ForwardingObjectTester to test any subclass of ForwardingObject. Since it has to use EasyMock partial mock, I had to place it under javatests/. Along the way, fixed a few oversights in ForwardingWrapperTester.
Lint Javadoc for HTML and syntax, and fix errors.
Fix Escaper.java comment typo.
Properly use the expected-size factory methods in MultimapBuilder, instead of conflating capacity with expected size.
Skip gpg signing by default, which can be overridden on the command-line at release time with -Dgpg.sign=false
Update some javadoc in the graph builders, add sample code. Run g4 fix on the files.
Inline the implementation of DoubleMath.mean rather than using a helper class. This is called inside loops often enough that I think it's worth avoiding the object assignment. Also improve the javadoc.
Allow terminal hyphens on domain parts.
Rollforward [] with the missing dep added.
Move cancellation propagation from cancel() to done().
Implement FarmHash's Fingerprint64 in Java.
bump version number
Improve the performance of addEdge(). This doesn't change the big O runtime (it's already O(1)), but it does eliminate several hash lookups :)
Preliminary ValueGraph interfaces.
In Ascii, define a constant for the character case bitmask, and use it in place of 0x20 and 0x5f throughout the class.
manual sync
Make common.collect spliterators backed by an int-indexed function correctly splittable.
Eliminate test that uses systemNanos() but expects nano precision, which will break on platforms that only have micro precision.  The test isn't really testing anything, so rather than fix it, I'm removing it.
Link from SettableFuture to AbstractFuture, and do some more rewriting and reformatting.
Special-case ImmutableMap.copyOf(EnumMap).
Remove MapMaker.expireAfterAccess() from public API internally. Please use CacheBuilder instead.
Hide Utf8Benchmark, which has taken on some internal-only code.
Annotate some flaky slow tests as @AndroidIncompatible.
Reflect Navigable* support in GWT in TreeMultimap.

Update @since tags to @since 23.1.
Push down logic of AbstractMapBasedMultimap.createAsMap into subtypes.
Deprecate DiscreteDomains.

test for indexOf with two array arguments; isEmpty and other methods of BooleanArrayAsList
Fix @GuardedBy annotations with invalid lock expressions.
Add TODO to use ofElementsIn(expected).
Fixed dropping of CharMatcher description when precomputing.
Manual fix-ups before we google-java-format.
Remove unnecessary "unused" suppressions.
Remove references to AsyncLoadingCache from CacheBuilder docs.
Fix TreeMultiset.subMultiset().size() overflow condition.
Remove non-interface methods from Multimap implementations.
Provide ExecutorService decorators that will rename the threads in which its tasks run for the duration of the task.
Skip cases in which checkedMultiply() fails on Gingerbread (because of an Android bug that has since been fixed).
Fix @since for EscaperAsserts.
Add a test case to EnumsTest that ensures that the Enums.getIfPresent method doesn't cause a reference to the Enum class parameter to be held indefinitely.
Avoid referencing any Ordering methods except natural() in ImmutableSortedSet.
Optimize PairedStatsAccumulator.addAll(PairedStats). If we update the xStats before we update sumOfProductsOfDeltas, instead of after, so that we use the new value of (values.xStats().mean() - xStats.mean()) instead of the old value, then we absorb two of the factors in the product, and save ourselves a multiplication and a division.
Introduce a package-private BaseGraph interface and AbstractBaseGraph class. This allows us to remove a large amount of code duplication. It also gives us a small reduction in constant overhead for Graphs.
Test and document LoadingCache's behavior in the face of InterruptedException (mostly by linking to the new <http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/CachesExplained#Interruption>).
Introduce MultimapTestSuiteBuilder, hoping to eventually migrate from AbstractMultimapTest.
Schedule assignableFrom for deletion.
Hide Downloading/Downloaded lines from output.
Suppress warning for modification of immutable collections
More strictly restrict when fields are added to the set of relevant fields, only supporting non-synthetic String fields.
Open source some more benchmarks.

Change the behavior of Service.Listener and ServiceManager.Listener such that we guarantee that listener callbacks (for a single listener) will never be called concurrently.  Previously, the only semantics we guaranteed was about the order in which callbacks were submitted to executor.execute.  This significantly strengthens those guarantees.

Optimize LongMath.binomial by accumulating into separate numerator and denominator variables whenever overflow is known to be impossible, as in the BigIntegerMath implementation.
fix version numbers on Guava for non-release trunk to fit with maven version numbering standards.
Update public suffix list.

Fix bug where Multiset.elementSet.remove did not propagate changes to Multiset.size.
Applied package sanity tests to common.math
Fix Travis build (hopefully) by setting max heap in the same <argLine> that sets the user language/country.
More reformatting.
Add size-related methods to Byte/CharSource:
Yet another flaky test.
For APIs that require Java 7, strip them from Guava-Android entirely, not just from our internal copy of Guava-Android.
Graduate Queues.synchronized{Que,Deq}ue from @Beta.

CHANGE: Make HostAndPort GwtCompatible by getting rid of a regex.
Fix up javadocs to say "{@link Foo} instances" instead of "{@link Foo}s".
Fix another typo in javadoc.
Add a TODO; inadvertently update some copyright dates.

Eliminate EmptyImmutableSortedSet, while we're at it.
Fixed a FreshValueGenerator bug that causes failure in generating fresh values recursively when there are finite number of distinct values provided by user.
Add missing common.primitives to Guava for Android.
Explain relationship with juf.Function.
Remove JDK5 hack now that Guava is on JDK6.

Fix a typo.
Assorted cleanup:
Remove usage of Truth from Guava Testlib.

Update open-source Guava to Truth 0.13, and tighten up tests from allOf->exactly and allFrom->exactlyAs.
Make HostAndPort serializable.
Cache Ordering.natural().nulls{First,Last}(), since those are very commonly used. https://github.com/google/guava/issues/1451
Fix Ordering.leastOf for very large k
Add Apache header to BloomFilterStrategies
Eliminate some CollectionIncompatibleType errors that were suppressed by CL 106598613.
- Cache.get(K, Callable<V>) => get(K, Callable<? extends V>)
manual sync
Internal GWT change
Link to the new spec instead of the old one, and do so more concisely.
Remove unnecessary Type parameter
Stop using assertSeededHashFunctionEquals for goodFastHash.
Forwarding classes out of @Beta (except standardFoo() methods).
Migrate from deprecated InternetDomainName.name() to equivalent toString().
Automated rollback of changelist f380040f0041f94c83d24623c10f32de58d436c4
Miscellaneous cleanup.
Replace MoreAsserts calls so that code compiles in Guava.
Mutable{Graph, Network, ValueGraph}.java: tighten the contract for the edge-adding methods.  The contract now states that if the specified nodes are not already present in the graph, they are silently added.  (Removes the option of throwing in this case.)
Extracted FreshValueGenerator from ForwardingWrapperTester to a stand-alone class so it can be reused for automated equals testing.
Make equals/hashcode methods in AbstractGraph/Network final, since changing the behavior of these while still implementing the interface is incorrect.
Remove removal dates for non-@Beta deprecations.
remove spurious new method
Make the load factor for "inner" (per node/edge) hash maps and sets 1.0. Note that non-multi networks use HashBiMaps, which already have an unmodifiable load factor of 1.0.
Remove NullPointerTester#ignore(Member).

Add @since for RangeSet.intersects.
Factor out common logic in ImmutableMultiset.EntrySet implementations
Prepare common.graph for Java-8-specific changes.
Refactor out some common functionality in the HttpHeadersTest.
Copy factory methods from Ranges to Range.
Add more test coverage for Immutable graphs/networks.
Add paragraph to javadoc for Network.edgesConnecting().
Fix non-fatal GWT compilation errors:
Fix Javadoc breakage under JDK11 canary.
Completely overhaul top-level javadoc for common.graph interfaces in light of the new interface hierarchy. Spend a lot of time answering what I think will be the #1 question users have: should I use a Graph or a Network? Spend a lot less time defining graph theory terms, that's what wikipedia is for :) plus the method-level javadoc defines terms as necessary. Overall, make it a lot more concise. Javadoc that's too long for anyone to bother reading is just as good as javadoc that doesn't exist!
Add a bit of test coverage for value graphs.
Fall back to countByReading if InputStream available always returns zero.
doc cleanup
Update Guava version to 17.0-SNAPSHOT.
Huge new source dump for source release 3, which will also become our first
Implement ByteSource.asCharSource(charset).read() using the decoding string constructor instead of streaming the contents into a StringBuilder.

Fix arrayListValues(int) in MultimapBuilder to actually throw IAE when expectedValuesPerKey is negative.
Shuffling from internal-only change.
Delete EmptyImmutableTable, which isn't clearly worth the code complexity.
Add parseUnsignedByte, toString, and MAX_VALUE to UnsignedBytes.
Avoid boxing ints in ConcurrentHashMultiset Preconditions checks
Replace unnecessary StringBuilder calls with String concat
Reduce iterations for MinMaxPriorityQueueTest under GWT.
Update the handling of gwt.xml files.
Delete unused SingletonImmutableBiMap(Entry) constructor.
Add @CheckReturnValue to SortedLists. This forces the caller of these APIs to "do something" with the result of the call.
Add a third AtomicHelper strategy to abstract future
Migrate Caliper benchmarks from the old, superclass-based API to the new, annotation-based API.
Mark methods in Graphs that take a Predicate as @GoogleInternal until we can migrate to JDK 8's Predicate. Rename the merge*From() methods to copy*(). Change the behavior of copyEdges from copying over all edges (and adding incident nodes as necessary) to only copying over edges where the incident nodes are already present (and thus not adding any additional nodes), as was discussed in API review.

Remove compare(boolean, boolean), which has been renamed to compareFalseFirst.
Introduce InternerBuilder, which allows tweaking of the concurrency level of the to-be-built Interner.
Move the static "constructor" methods in ElementOrder above the class methods (as done in e.g. Endpoints). Also, remove "final" from the static methods, since it's not standard practice to include on static methods (and the class itself is final).
Update Public Suffix data.

Remove tests of Multiset.elementSet() that are redundant with the SetTestSuite generated for Multiset.elementSet() by MultisetTestSuiteBuilder.  (Some tests will still need to be migrated.)

Mark AtomicLongMap @GwtCompatible.
Remove APIs to be deleted for Guava 20.0.
Add edgeValueOrDefault() method to ValueGraph interface, and remove Map-returning edgeValues() for now. This CL effectively rolls back []
specify plugin versions
Disable compilation of benchmarks, which have been updated to require a version of Caliper that has not been publicly packaged.
Use the renamingDecorator to ensure that Services always run in appropriately named threads.
Avoid garbage allocation in simple hashBytes calls with Murmur3.
More reformatting.
Changed Invokable to always return the source-view of parameters, even for non-static inner class constructors.
Reformat with google-java-format
Fix cycles com.google.common.cache.
Add Vector tests to guava-testlib's TestsForListsInJavaUtil
Add javadoc of common ways to obtain a non-public-constructable objects.
remove lenient builder

Delete the existing Hypergraph interface. We're pretty much 100% sure this is not where we want it in the interface hierarchy, and leaving it there as a public interface isn't helping anyone.
Clean up the implementation of roots() and move it to Graphs. This is part of the effort to delete GraphProperties.java, as discussed earlier. The other method in GraphProperties is isCyclic(), which I'd like to handle separately (e.g. it should handle undirected graphs if it's going to be in Graphs, or maybe moved to labs/).
Fix small javadoc typo in Stopwatch#elapsedMillis.
Add pom.xml files for Guava-Android
Document that we don't forward calls to default methods, Multimap edition.

Change Sources/Sinks to implement Input/OutputSupplier temporarily, to make migration of usages easier (make it possible to change an InputSupplier to a ByteSource without changing an API that takes an InputSupplier at the same time). The getInput/Output methods are @Deprecated since they shouldn't be called directly. Also make public methods for viewing Input/OutputSuppliers as Sources/Sinks.
Disable incorrect @GuardedBy annotations.
Move oppositeNode() from Graphs to Endpoints and rename it otherNode(). Also make a few methods final. It changes the following code:
Eagerly check for an appropriate exceptionClass constructor during calls to Futures.getChecked.
Remove MapMaker.expireAfterWrite(), the expirationQueue, ticker related functionality, and all expirable/evictable related implementation details.
Update Public Suffix data.
Removing unnecessary index bounds check for lazy striped when
Updating putString(String) spec and default implementation, to avoid
Write a more compact ImmutableTable implementation.
Prevent our rollup modules from including any "real" source files from c.g.c subpackages.
Add test in MultisetForEachEntryTester to test multiple copies of a single element.
Updates math utilities to use JDK 6 methods where possible, addressing several TODOs.
Make ordering of Primitives#all{Wrapper,Primitive}Types deterministic
Changes AtomicLongMap#removeAllZeros to use iterator for removals.
Change primitives #toArray to take Collection<? extends Number>
Optimize BigIntegerMath.log10 by using the log2 to get an initial approximation of the log10.
documentation enhancements to Cache, LoadingCache, and CacheBuilder
Optimize ImmutableCollection.toArray(T[]) as per https://shipilev.net/blog/2016/arrays-wisdom-ancients/, the key goal being to avoid the necessity of zeroing a newly created array where possible.
Use callbacks on ListenableFutures to implement invokeAny on AbstractListeningExecutoreService rather than an ExecutorCompletionService.
Add JPMS module name
Move EMPTY to RegularImmutableList.
Tell Travis to wait for Maven to finish.
Push asList() cache down into ImmutableCollection subtypes to avoid holding onto the extra reference in ImmutableList.
Reenable EnumMap tests, which work as of JDK7: http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6312706
Discourage people from mocking or otherwise creating custom implementations of ListenableFuture.

- fix @links to point to LoadingCache
Add missing <inherits> to modules.
Add a benchmark comparing CRC32 and Adler32 hashing using the Checksum API directly and using the common.hash API.
Inline remaining usages of Throwables.propagate. We are removing all calls in preparation for deleting the method.
Use diamond for collect tests.
Implement Hashing.weightedConsistentHash().
Add an optimization for CompoundOrdering to avoid iterator allocation.  On my benchmarks, for the common two-comparator case, the speedup is ~30%.
In com.google.common.reflect.Types, implement the TypeVariable interface using a dynamic proxy rather than an explicit implementation.
Adds an addAll(Stats) method to add a Stats object to a StatsAccumulator, and corresponding methods for PairedStats and PairedStatsAccumulator.
Improved the code coverage of OrderingTest and removed an unused constructor.
Add superclass safety check in getSupertype(), added @Beta and @since to TypeToken and Reflection.
Test that finalize deletes the backing file. This required refactoring the model code to make finalize accessible from tests.
Link to JDK Supplier, just as we link to JDK Function and Predicate.
Add missing rejectionPropagatesToOutput tests.
Add tests to the asMap() views of ListMultimap, SetMultimap, and SortedSetMultimap to verify that the asMap().values() are of the correct type (List, Set, SortedSet) at runtime.
Some fixes to java5-compatible compilation
Minor style tweak (doesn't actually change anything, but the better symmetry makes me happy).
Generalize the javadocs on CacheBuilder.ticker()
Return a NavigableSet from TreeMultimap.get
Add CacheStats.plus() similar to minus().
Disable doclint when building under JDK8.


Remove the method Graphs.roots(). “roots” as we’re defining them isn’t really a standard term of art (I can only find references to ROOTED graphs, which have exactly one root). Additional reasons to remove:
Remove methods scheduled for deletion in Guava 21.
Replace custom TestAssertionFailure with JUnit AssertionFailedError.
update artifact names
Remove tests from AbstractSetMultimapTest redundant with tests from SetMultimapPut(All)Tester.
Rollforward [] which was rolled back in [] because it

Roll forward.
Add @CheckReturnValue to Multiset and friends.
Fix serialization of GWT SingletonImmutableBiMap.inverse().
Add some known UTF-8 hash values to Murmur3_32 tests. UTF-8 is more comparable between platforms than relying on Java's internal encoding.
Add closeQuietly(InputStream) and closeQuietly(Reader).
Depend on error_prone_annotations 2.1.3.

Use features from GWT 2.6.0:
Make the constructors on Source/Sink classes protected.

Add Stopwatch#elapsed in prep for migration from elapsedTime() and
Remove unused code.
Use a newer version of Mockito, as necessary for Java 9.

Open source c.g.common.hash into Guava 11.0
Address lint identified by https://github.com/lewisd32/lint-maven-plugin
An optimization for Graphs and Networks, inspired by Michael. Introduce "MapIteratorCache" and "MapRetrievalCache". MapIteratorCache is extremely light-weight and optimizes the follow case:
Remove GuavaAsserts, replacing all calls with calls to Assert.
Remove usages of CaliperMain from java_benchmarks targets since the deps for java_benchmarks don't need to (and shouldn't) include CaliperMain anymore.
only read ticker once per operation
Simplify some code in directed graphs. In particular, make removing the incident edges when removing a node more intuitive. Note that removeNode() in undirected graphs currently is O(degree^2) (for multigraphs), but that will be alleviated once we have AbstractIncidenceSetGraph and it moves to this implementation.
Add @CheckReturnValue to entire Optional class.
Add FluentFuture.from(FluentFuture) factory method.
Increase heap.
This CL fixes method calls that incorrectly ignore the return
Remove final switch from CaseFormat.
Override close() in all subclasses of FilterOutputStream to ensure they do not swallow exceptions thrown when flushing the delegate stream.
Change README to README.md and make it reference GitHub locations rather than Google Code.
PredecessorsFunction, SuccessorsFunction: remove @GoogleInternal annotation, now that we've resolved the "what type should the method return?" question.
Deprecate Hasher#hashCode(), implementations of this method return a hashCode of the Hasher object itself and not the hashed data, deprecating this would help warn users of making this mistake.
A few final minor javadoc fixes to close external guava bugs.
Annotate MediaType.toString with @LazyInit and remove volatile (which is
Replace "DirectedIncidentNodes" and "UndirectedIncidentNodes" with a shared "IncidentNodes" class that implements Set. This avoids the call to .asImmutableSet() that the directed graphs were performing, and also makes it so that we are now very close to having an abstract base graph implementation that will almost entirely replace the 4 current implementations.
Prefer hardcoding constant over calculating at runtime.
Add test for the complicated example in Guava issue #1342.
Improve Funnel javadocs about using an enum.
Adding a custom serialization option, when the space overhead of java serialization

Make toImmutableList() and toImmutableSet() collectors singletons.
Cleanup grab bag:
Warn about upcoming deprecation of Multimap static factory methods.
Fix comment to refer to InternetDomainName.isValid instead of deprecated isValidLenient.
- Fix scheduleWithFixed(Delay|Rate). As originally implemented, scheduleWithFixed(Delay|Rate) would submit a Callable/Runnable wrapped in a FutureTask to the delegate ScheduledExecutorService and fail to run more than once due to run-once nature of FutureTask.
Remove "nullness" suppressions added in CL 152864813.
Warnings-related cleanup to c.g.c.base and its tests. Ruthlessly standardizing the comment we use so these can potentially be replaced with string constants one day. In some cases I have actually removed unjustified suppressions.

Used an interface DelayProvider for simulating delay, and while unit testing fake delay provider is used that eradicates the use of Threads in unit test cases, which is not a good practice.

1) Refactored LotteryNumbers to use Joiner from guava library to join lottery numbers. 2) Solved potential thread safety issue in LotteryTicketId class, where it was using raw primitive value and incrementing it which is not thread-safe.

Update deps including Guava 20; use switch in pref to chained if-else for slightly more consistent style
Issue 1067 and more. Add "VALUE=DATE" to encoding of all-day dates. Don't pretend end was specified in original barcode if not present. However for benefit of Android Calendar apps, use +1 hour/day end time for missing end. Fix some error messages in appspot generator too.

Fixed a bug in geo coordinate display, where we were always tacking on "deg N" and "deg E", which doesn't make sense. Really, N/S/E/W needs to be determined by sign, and the sign removed for W and S.

Looks like -allowaccessmodification to ProGuard results in a bogus binary. It compiles, but the Dalvik verifier rejects it at runtime. I'm removing this flag for now, which means we lose inlining on some important getters and setters.

Update plugins (now requires Maven 3.2); fix javadoc warning
Fix typo in Norwegian translation (#918)
Fix unescaped quote in new translation and make translator escape quotes going forward
Added build-optimized target to produce optimized core.jar; tests now test optimized version; also removed the dependency from core to MIDP 2.0 as it was just depending on silly IllegalStateException

Added overload: open(cameraId)
Better web app logging and checkstyle update
More work on RIM client
Final changes for Barcode Scanner 3.2.
Improvements and refinements to web site
Finished work on the local binarizer and renamed it to HybridBinarizer. It uses the old histogram for 1D and the new approach for 2D. The unit tests don't fully demonstrate how much better this is in real-world lighting, but it pretty much solves the situation of pointing at a QR Code for 30 seconds without scanning, due to a shadow or gradient.
Reimplement History as a simple activity instead of dialog; add ability to delete one entry with a long press
Translation updates from NTN

Commit Dmitry's Russian update for him
Fixed a typo in our golden results.
Added 'T' as a shortcut to toggle debug method tracing using android.os.Debug and traceview for analysis. The traces are written to /sdcard, which means the SD Card must not be mounted as a volume by USB at the time. Tracing can slow down decoding by a factor of 5 or more but gives very useful insights into where the time is going.

Modified WhiteRectangleDetector
Indentation wtf
Reduced ProGuard passed from 7 to 4 since there was no additional benefit.

This second bug is strange

Issue 1044 maybe avoid NPE in onDraw() before CaptureActivity.onResume()
moved ProGuard optimization into Android build file since it's the only way to fully optimize the final build product (inlining of key methods). Also always dump proguard results.

Update plugins, deps; update Guava but restore Java 7 interop by using 23.0-android and restricting to zxingorg module

Avoid exception in rare case where loading of apps is cancelled
Various user-contributed fixes (Issue 701, Issue 710, Issue 714, Issue 718)
Updated the Android client to use native/local QR Code encoding. For now it still runs on a thread and has a temporary "Working..." dialog. As I optimize a bit further, these may not be necessary.
Fix some warnings from new inspection tool
Strangely, Exception constructors that take a chained Exception didn't exist before API level 9 (though have always been in Java). Don't use them to avoid NoSuchMethodError on Froyo and earlier.

Replace tabs with spaces ( part of accepting another big patch); fix one failing test due to typo
Created the base Writer object for all barcode encoding, then wrote a QR Code version. A Writer encodes a series of raw bytes into a 2D greyscale bitmap, represented by a ByteArray. This seems like a better container than MonochromeBitmapSource, because we may want shades of grey when encoding future formats. The next step is to hook this up to the Android client.

[maven-release-plugin] rollback the release of zxing-2.2
Update Android apps to need API 16+; remove stale Manifest config

Remove unused open function from OpenCameraInterface
Fixed the build and added some cleanup comments.

Oops remove bar again

Added Kamil Kaczmarczyk's full name

On scan we pass a grayscale image of the scanned image, which is used as a thumbnail. These days this is getting to be 2MB of data to bundle to copy around in memory. Instead scale by 50% and JPEG-encode. This saves some memory and paves the way for later perhaps saving the image data with history.

Apparently some of the default disabled optimizations are only there for Donut
Hebrew translation

Add possibility to choose the error correction level for the encoding
Japanese translation updates from asdf
Back up and restore poms to prerelease state

Fix javadoc 8 error
Put optimization behind a profile as it won't currently work with JDK9
Add support for Code B FNC characters
Created a new QR blackbox test with difficult exposures, mostly self-shadowing cases. We only get 34 out of 120 tests, which is about what I expected. To fix these we will have to move away from a global black point and towards a more sophisticated local thresholding algorithm.
One last improvement to clean target

Issue 465, remove reference to libs/ as it is not used
Added UPC support to the result types, and added a build target without J2ME.
Added a new QR Code unit test of real world photos of t-shirts. These are notoriously difficult because the barcodes don't lie completely flat. We're able to decode 33/48 which is better than I thought, although most of the images which fail look within reach.
Real fix for Issue 1044 - don't use static CameraManager
- Fixed a crash on first launch after install on some hardware.
Added android build.xml file

Move to use of Java 7 NIO2 APIs
Korean
Allow building of Android apps on Travis
Wrote a benchmark activity for Android which reads images recursively from the SD card, decodes each 10 times, and prints the average time to decode in milliseconds. The UI is extremely minimal, as the results are written to the log, but this is a good start towards measuring our performance under Dalvik on a platform without floating point hardware. This should run fine on the emulator but I haven't tested it yet.
Use 4x parallelism in unit tests
Add defensive checks for bad setFPS API behavior
Added an option to hide the contents when encoding a barcode via Intent.

Issue 663
Ensure beep MediaPlayer is released
Move PDF417 image to supported
Changed ProGuard settings so it will inline methods which use private members. This eliminates tens of thousands of function calls to BitArray.get() on a typical decode, and lots of other work as well. Overall we're roughly 20% faster by using ProGuard than turning it off.
Possible small bug fix and cleanup of unneeded code
Back-port ability to control exposure, scene mode and metering. Latter two disabled by default.
Should make android-v4 dependency optional since not every dependent project needs it
Work around Android browsers that don't register to handle HTTP:// and HTTPS:// schemes
Check in Android gen files and configure Android src roots in Maven
[maven-release-plugin] prepare release zxing-parent-2.3.0
Indentation wtf
I moved a chunk of the histogram/black point code out of BaseMonochromeBitmapSource and into BlackPointEstimator which makes a lot more sense. Unfortunately I had to expose three new methods and touch a bunch of files. But I did manage to reuse an array on subsequent calls, which was being allocated on every row scanned, so that might be a bit faster. It will also be easier to convert this code to JNI in the future if we want to, and/or do more advanced thresholding.
Updated Symbian project QQrDecoder. It now supports the latest devices and Symbian OSs (Symbian^3, Belle, Anna).
fix binary shift cost heuristics (#1044)
Support for aztec codes

Minor changes from inspection
Caught another exception when sharing contacts.
Fixed substring call
Translation updates from Morgan Courbet
Allow all long-ish ITF code lengths, as the result is very unlikely to be a false positive, and there are apparently a number of uses of long-ish ITF codes of various lengths out there. Allowed lengths are now interpreted as allowing those lengths and anything longer than the largest allowd length.
Issue 835: Added support for specifying a width and height for the scanning rectangle when launching Barcode Scanner by Intent.

Adding Bulgarian translation from Lachezar on his behalf
Corrected exception message in UPCEWriter (#1074)
Issue 675 commit Lachezars great fix for large DM decoding
Renamed UPC result type to Product, and introduced an idea of 'product ID' and 'normalized product ID' to account for UPC-E, where the actual visible ID is different from what we may want to search for as a key. Updated clients to use this too.
Avoid NPE when underlying result point is null, for some reason
Suppress one compile warning
Issue 997 fixes for Bulgarian strings
Another bug fix to go with Issue 1044 -- this one only cropped up on my tablet though
Issue 250: Provided a choice of creating a new contact or merging with an existing one.

Final changes for Barcode Scanner 2.93.
Added a whole bunch of Google web search country/language/TLD entries, as well as new ones for Google Product Search which is now in 10 countries.
Add history feature; group some functionality into subpackages
Now can use "-Ddebug=true" on the command line to build a non-optimized build with debug symbols. Also added check for ProGuard.
OK, last time, promise.
Faster test execution by reusing JVMs and conservatively scaling with cores
Fix camera/storage permissions problems in test app; refactor handling of files in benchmark
Final Barcode Scanner 3.4 changes:
Remove some unneeded strings
Aztec decoder returns raw bytes
Added support for Furigana using the SOUND field in MECARD. AddressBookParsedResult now has a pronunciation field to represent this. I'm not aware of whether this is supported in other formats like VCARD, so they all pass null for now.
Make DoS test case possibly less flaky
Fix some obvious errors in TLD mappings. Key on country, not country-language, so it actually works in most cases!
Rewrote the Android M3 client to do continuous decoding, which means you no longer have to push the shutter button. Now you can just place the barcode in the viewfinder and it will display the contents as soon as it decodes them. That also means you no longer get "barcode not found" error dialogs which is a big improvement. Also made sure that capturing debug JPEGs uses unique filenames.
Disable test that is flaky on OpenJDK 7 only for now
Major reorg of test cases
minSize from provided sizes
Barcode Scanner 4.7.8
Changed "Search book" back to "Search book contents" for clarity, since it's too confusing next to the "Book Search" button. The "Custom search" button will wrap in this case but it still fits fine.
Improved Korean Translation
Changes to be consistent with Android client, including a rename
Fixes issue #908
Build Java 9 on Travis; update plugins

More small static analysis stuff
Add bulk scan mode with preference (and rearrange prefs a bit). Reorder main strings file, add new pref string and remove probably-incorrect ellipses from Asian language translations
[maven-release-plugin] prepare release zxing-3.1.0
WIth Lee (Wildfire owner) helping found the cause -- bizarre issue with Wildfire where it can't find a UI element. Disabling it for these devices.

Fixed Search Book Contents when built under ProGuard.
Forgot to add flashlight permission
Issue #86 : Fix logic error in Code 39 that was requiring too much quiet zone
Added 52 real world UPC-A greyscale test images. We get 26/52, but more with try harder. I think I'm going to break try harder results into their own test so we can track these separately.
Renamed 'zxing-icon-128.png' to 'ZxingLarge.png' to get the App Store to accept the uploaded binary. Updated the 'About.html'
Fix for bug #593

Morgan's cosmetic improvement to a translation, and equivalent for other translations we dare touch
[maven-release-plugin] prepare for next development iteration
First pass at adding a UI for sharing data via QR Codes. There's now a Share button in the main capture menu which leads to a choice of contacts, bookmarks, and clipboard contents, which will be encoded and shown full screen. Launching the bookmarks picker currently crashes with a permission problem, which I'm investigating.
The history preference is now loaded at construction time
Issue 336: set Intent flag to make sure task's launched activities don't stay on top when returning to BS. Doing this for all Intents for now
Add cropping for RGBLuminanceSource. And remove some unrelated dead code.
Bump to BS 4.6.5
Update site version, use HTTPS more in docs
Update ZXingTest to work on 3.x+, mostly by removing the camera capture bit for now. It can come back after android/ is updated and can be cloned again. Updated android-integration with better API and ability to specify package. Now ZXingTest uses our integration code. It's updated for Android 2.x and reports camera params in a slightly better form. Also fixed a few Android 2.x issues and related intent integration stuff left over from other recent changes.
Added a new unit test of real world QR codes. We get 29/42 - pretty good, but room for improvement.
Updated our list of countries for Book Search.
Better handling of empty/incomplete content stream
Raise history limit to 2000
Minor version updates
Issue 1817 don't include name/title in map search
Force workaround on for Optimus
Properly drop table on update
Issue 1670 remove Ant scripts in favor of Maven where possible
Issue #167 : recognize protocols like opc.tcp as valid URI schemes
Consolidated all the Android LuminanceSource classes into one file. Either a device can be handled by this file, or the app won't work. The Android platform requires every device to support yuv420sp camera preview buffers, but we also let two other similar formats sneak in for compatibility. I also removed the ability to convert LuminanceSource data into ARGB images, which wasn't used.
[maven-release-plugin] rollback the release of zxing-3.3.1
Translation updated to Portuguese-BR
