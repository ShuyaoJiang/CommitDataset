This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. Changes to package io.netty.handler.ssl: Add a class for abstract sni handler. It allows to: Decode ctx channel handler context; Select ctx channel handler context; Handle operation complete; Handle fire sni completion event; Get lookup; Process abstract sni handler abstract sni handler on lookup complete; Read ctx channel handler context; Handle bind; Connect ctx channel handler context; Disconnect ctx channel handler context; Close abstract sni handler; Deregister ctx channel handler context; Write ctx channel handler
