This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. Changes to package io.netty.channel.socket: Add an interface declaration for duplex channel. It allows to: Check if duplex channel is input shutdown; Get shutdown input; Check if duplex channel is output shutdown; Get shutdown output; Check if duplex channel is shutdown; Get shutdown;
