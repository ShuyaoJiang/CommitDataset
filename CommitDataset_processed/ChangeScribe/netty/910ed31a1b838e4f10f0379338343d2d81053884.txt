This is a degenerate modifier commit: this change set is composed of empty, incidental, and abstract methods. These methods indicate that a new feature is planned. Changes to package io.netty.buffer: Add a class for empty byte buf test. It allows to: Handle test is writable; Handle test write empty byte buf; Handle test is readable; Handle test array; Handle test nio buffer; Handle test memory address; Handle consistent equals and hash code with abstract bytebuf
