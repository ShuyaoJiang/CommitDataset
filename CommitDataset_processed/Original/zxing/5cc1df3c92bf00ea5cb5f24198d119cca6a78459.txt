Finished work on the local binarizer and renamed it to HybridBinarizer. It uses the old histogram for 1D and the new approach for 2D. The unit tests don't fully demonstrate how much better this is in real-world lighting, but it pretty much solves the situation of pointing at a QR Code for 30 seconds without scanning, due to a shadow or gradient.
