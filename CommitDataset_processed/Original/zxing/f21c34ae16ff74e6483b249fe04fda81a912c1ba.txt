First pass at adding a UI for sharing data via QR Codes. There's now a Share button in the main capture menu which leads to a choice of contacts, bookmarks, and clipboard contents, which will be encoded and shown full screen. Launching the bookmarks picker currently crashes with a permission problem, which I'm investigating.
