On scan we pass a grayscale image of the scanned image, which is used as a thumbnail. These days this is getting to be 2MB of data to bundle to copy around in memory. Instead scale by 50% and JPEG-encode. This saves some memory and paves the way for later perhaps saving the image data with history.
