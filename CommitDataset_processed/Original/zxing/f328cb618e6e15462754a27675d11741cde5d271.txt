Update ZXingTest to work on 3.x+, mostly by removing the camera capture bit for now. It can come back after android/ is updated and can be cloned again. Updated android-integration with better API and ability to specify package. Now ZXingTest uses our integration code. It's updated for Android 2.x and reports camera params in a slightly better form. Also fixed a few Android 2.x issues and related intent integration stuff left over from other recent changes.
