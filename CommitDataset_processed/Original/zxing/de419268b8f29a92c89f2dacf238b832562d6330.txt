Wrote a benchmark activity for Android which reads images recursively from the SD card, decodes each 10 times, and prints the average time to decode in milliseconds. The UI is extremely minimal, as the results are written to the log, but this is a good start towards measuring our performance under Dalvik on a platform without floating point hardware. This should run fine on the emulator but I haven't tested it yet.
