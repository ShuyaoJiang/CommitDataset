Added 'T' as a shortcut to toggle debug method tracing using android.os.Debug and traceview for analysis. The traces are written to /sdcard, which means the SD Card must not be mounted as a volume by USB at the time. Tracing can slow down decoding by a factor of 5 or more but gives very useful insights into where the time is going.
