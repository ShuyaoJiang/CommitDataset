Fixed a bug in geo coordinate display, where we were always tacking on "deg N" and "deg E", which doesn't make sense. Really, N/S/E/W needs to be determined by sign, and the sign removed for W and S. However, since none of that can be translated easily, I removed it, and we now just print lat, long which is an acceptable standard.
