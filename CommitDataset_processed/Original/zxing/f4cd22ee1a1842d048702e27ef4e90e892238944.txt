Consolidated all the Android LuminanceSource classes into one file. Either a device can be handled by this file, or the app won't work. The Android platform requires every device to support yuv420sp camera preview buffers, but we also let two other similar formats sneak in for compatibility. I also removed the ability to convert LuminanceSource data into ARGB images, which wasn't used.
