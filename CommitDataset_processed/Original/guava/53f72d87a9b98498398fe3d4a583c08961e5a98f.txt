Delete the unused, @GoogleInternal copy* methods (in particular, copyNodes, copyEdges, and their Predicate-based counterparts). We're missing the ValueGraph version for all of these, and in the copyEdges case, also the Graph version. The Predicate-based methods have the obvious issue that we'd want to release with the Java-8 Predicate, not the Guava Predicate. copyNodes() and copyEdges() have the unfortunate issue of there not being an obvious correct answer for the whether the source or destination should come first in the parameters. And finally, copyEdges() requires us to decide what to do in the event that the destination graph doe not contain the incident nodes (and neither option is particularly intuitive). Overall, we'd rather not have to support these methods at this point.
