Introduce AbstractGraph. This is a bare-bones base class that all Graph implementations should be able to extend (analogous to e.g. AbstractSet for Sets). It ensures there is consistent equals()/hashCode() across different Graph implementations. Additionally, this CL drops the requirement that two graphs have to have "the same type" to be equal.
