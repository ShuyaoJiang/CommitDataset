Clean up some exceptions. In general, the pattern we try to follow is that if the user provides an invalid argument (e.g. a node not in a graph), we throw an IllegalStateException with a detailed error message. If it's an internal method and something is wrong on our end, we throw an IllegalStateException (and don't usually bother with an error message).
