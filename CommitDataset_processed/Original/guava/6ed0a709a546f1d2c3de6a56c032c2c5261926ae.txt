Update definitions of equals() and hashCode() for Graph/Network. The new hashCode() shouldn't change any behavior (of course) but should be more efficient for directed graphs. equals() does change behavior in certain corner cases (see [] but it was arguably broken before. To keep things simple, we now flat out say directed != undirected.
