Rename NodeConnections to NetworkConnections and NodeAdjacencies to GraphConnections. Have a base interface called "NodeConnections". This change is just cosmetic right now (although we do refer to these things as "connections" everywhere, so it's nice to actually have "NodeConnections" be the base interface), but it will make more sense in the context of ValueGraph (there will be a ValueGraphConnections).
