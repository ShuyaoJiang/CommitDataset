Reduce the memory usage of Networks by roughly 20%. Delete the IncidentNodes class. Remove (unused) equals/hashcode impl from NodeConnections. Additionally, removeEdge() is now O(1) in all cases (used to be O(D) for networks with parallel edges). edgesConnecting() is now O(1) for networks that donâ€™t allow parallel edges (used to be O(D), even though a network without parallel edges cannot return > 1 edge for this method).
