Standardize that Functions.foo().toString() returns "Functions.foo()." (I've preserved two existing exceptions: compose(b, a) (which returns "b(a)") and forMap(map, default) (which returns "Functions.forMap(map, defaultValue=default)"). I don't know whether that's ideal, but it doesn't feel worth spending too much time worrying about.)
