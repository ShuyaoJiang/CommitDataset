Simplify some code in directed graphs. In particular, make removing the incident edges when removing a node more intuitive. Note that removeNode() in undirected graphs currently is O(degree^2) (for multigraphs), but that will be alleviated once we have AbstractIncidenceSetGraph and it moves to this implementation.
