Rename ConfigurableNetwork->ConfigurableMutableNetwork and ConfigurableGraph->ConfigurableMutableGraph. A followup CL will rename AbstractConfigurableNetwork->ConfigurableNetwork and AbstractConfigurableGraph->ConfigurableGraph (this is being done in two seperate CLs otherwise critique doesn't understand it's a rename). The above mentioned classes are not actually abstract, so calling them Abstract* is wrong.
