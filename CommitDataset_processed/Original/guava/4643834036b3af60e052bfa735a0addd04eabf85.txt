I was reading through the class-level javadoc (which could use some cleaning up, but I think jrtom said he's working on that), and this passage struck me. The latter two options don't seem like something that would actually happen. For example, we allow nodes of any type, so an impl where the nodes store the topology and cannot be shared across graphs doesn't really make sense.
