Add the method Graphs.endpoints() that does what you expect: returns the endpoints corresponding to each edge in a graph. The whole "we print every edge in an undirected graph's toString() twice, and that's a feature not a bug *wink*" annoyed me. Also there's other cases, such as copyOf() and and getWeaklyConnectedComponents(), where we don't want to process each edge twice. In those particular cases they happen to be no-ops, but for cases where it's not, or where you do something computationally expensive, doubling up on undirected edges is bad :(
