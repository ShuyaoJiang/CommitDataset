Update edgesConnecting().size() and edgesConnecting().isEmpty() to be more efficient for Networks with parallel edges. In particular, take advantage of the cached successor multisets. Currently the methods are always O(D). This will also be O(D) if successors hasn't been invoked, but will be O(1) for future calls. For example, with something like:
