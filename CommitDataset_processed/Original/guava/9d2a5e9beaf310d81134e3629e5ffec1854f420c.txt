Make degree(node) on directed networks O(1) instead of O(D), at the cost of a teensy bit of memory (a self loop counter). In actuality it doesn't seem to take up any extra memory, perhaps due to how the object is padded/aligned. Additionally, this CL makes iterating through incidentEdges() slightly faster on directed networks if no self-loops are present. In the undirected case, adding and removing self-loop edges is now slightly faster.
