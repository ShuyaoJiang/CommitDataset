Intermittent failure was due to Thread.sleep in the code. While performing unit test cases there was race condition between two threads, so it was not guaranteed to work every time. Used an interface DelayProvider for simulating delay, and while unit testing fake delay provider is used that eradicates the use of Threads in unit test cases, which is not a good practice.
